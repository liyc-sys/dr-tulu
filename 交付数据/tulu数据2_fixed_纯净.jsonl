We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures.

Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison \"usual activities\", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with \"usual activities\" or \"usual care\" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life).", "year": "2017", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}, {"paperId": "17127557", "title": "Effect of non-invasive ventilation on survival, quality of life, respiratory function and cognition: a review of the literature.", "abstract": "Symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation may negatively influence the quality of life (QoL) of ALS patients long before respiratory failure ensues.

Neuromuscular respiratory failure is the most common cause of death, which usually occurs within two to five years of the disease onset. Supporting respiratory function with mechanical ventilation may improve survival and quality of life. This is the second update of a review first published in 2009.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of mechanical ventilation (tracheostomy-assisted ventilation and non-invasive ventilation (NIV)) on survival, functional measures of disease progression, and quality of life in ALS, and to evaluate adverse events related to the intervention.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 30 January 2017. We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving non-invasive or tracheostomy-assisted ventilation in participants with a clinical diagnosis of ALS, independent of the reported outcomes. We included comparisons with no intervention or the best standard care.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nFor the original review, four review authors independently selected studies for assessment. Two review authors reviewed searches for this update. All review authors independently extracted data from the full text of selected studies and assessed the risk of bias in studies that met the inclusion criteria. We attempted to obtain missing data where possible. We planned to collect adverse event data from the included studies.\nMAIN RESULTS\nFor the original Cochrane Review, the review authors identified two RCTs involving 54 participants with ALS receiving NIV. There were no new RCTs or quasi-RCTs at the first update. One new RCT was identified in the second update but was excluded for the reasons outlined below.Incomplete data were available for one published study comparing early and late initiation of NIV (13 participants). We contacted the trial authors, who were not able to provide the missing data. The conclusions of the review were therefore based on a single study of 41 participants comparing NIV with standard care. Lack of (or uncertain) blinding represented a risk of bias for participant- and clinician-assessed outcomes such as quality of life, but it was otherwise a well-conducted study with a low risk of bias.The study provided moderate-quality evidence that overall median survival was significantly different between the group treated with NIV and the standard care group. The median survival in the NIV group was 48 days longer (219 days compared to 171 days for the standard care group (estimated 95% confidence interval 12 to 91 days, P = 0.0062)). This survival benefit was accompanied by an enhanced quality of life. On subgroup analysis, in the subgroup with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function (20 participants), median survival was 205 days longer (216 days in the NIV group versus 11 days in the standard care group, P = 0.0059), and quality of life measures were better than with standard care (low-quality evidence). In the participants with poor bulbar function (21 participants), NIV did not prolong survival or improve quality of life, although there was significant improvement in the mean symptoms domain of the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index by some measures. Neither trial reported clinical data on intervention-related adverse effects.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nModerate-quality evidence from a single RCT of NIV in 41 participants suggests that it significantly prolongs survival, and low-quality evidence indicates that it improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and quality of life were significantly improved in the subgroup of people with better bulbar function, but not in those with severe bulbar impairment. Adverse effects related to NIV should be systematically reported, as at present there is little information on this subject. More RCT evidence to support the use of NIV in ALS will be difficult to generate, as not offering NIV to the control group is no longer ethically justifiable. Future studies should examine the benefits of early intervention with NIV and establish the most appropriate timing for initiating NIV in order to obtain its maximum benefit. The effect of adding cough augmentation techniques to NIV also needs to be investigated in an RCT. Future studies should examine the health economics of NIV. Access to NIV remains restricted in many parts of the world, including Europe and North America.

In a single randomized trial analyzed in multiple Cochrane reviews, NIV prolonged survival and improved quality of life in patients with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function, while in those with poor bulbar function survival was not prolonged and quality-of-life gains were not sustained. These subgroup differences remain a key consideration in clinical practice. <cite id=\"28982219,28072907,19821325\">In a single randomized trial analyzed in multiple Cochrane reviews, NIV prolonged survival and improved quality of life in patients with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function, while in those with poor bulbar function survival was not prolonged and quality-of-life gains were not sustained</cite>.\n\n# Survival benefit\n\n- Quantitatively, the randomized evidence shows an absolute survival advantage with NIV. In the core RCT (n=41), median survival was 48 days longer with NIV versus standard care (219 days vs 171 days), with a 205-day advantage in the subgroup with normal to moderate bulbar impairment (216 vs 11 days), whereas patients with poor bulbar function did not experience survival benefit.

One large clinical cohort found tracheostomy-free survival from symptom onset of 28 months with NIV versus 15 months without (adjusted HR 0.72), and estimated survival benefits of about 13 months overall and 19 months in ALS bulbar-onset cases. <cite id=\"25857659\">One large clinical cohort found tracheostomy-free survival from symptom onset of 28 months with NIV versus 15 months without (adjusted HR 0.72), and estimated survival benefits of about 13 months overall and 19 months in ALS bulbar-onset cases</cite>.\n\n# Quality of life\n\n- Across controlled and observational studies, NIV consistently improves patient-reported outcomes, particularly sleep-related symptoms (e.g., somnolence, fatigue), daytime alertness, and overall quality of life during the early to mid stages of the disease. Systematic reviews and narrative summaries report improvements in quality of life domains alongside survival benefits in patients without severe bulbar dysfunction. <cite id=\"28072907,24315469,17127557,25110934\">Across controlled and observational studies, NIV consistently improves patient-reported outcomes, particularly sleep-related symptoms, daytime alertness, and overall quality of life during the early to mid stages of the disease</cite>.\n\n# Who benefits and when\n\n- Patients with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function derive the greatest benefit, with improved survival and maintained quality of life.

Such coinfections in children with COVID-19 have been reported to increase morbidity and mortality. Objectives: To identify the type and proportion of coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and bacteria, fungi, and/or respiratory viruses, and investigate the severity of COVID-19 in children. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched ProQuest, Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Wiley online library, Scopus, and Nature through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for studies on the incidence of COVID-19 in children with bacterial, fungal, and/or respiratory coinfections, published from 1 December 2019 to 1 October 2022, with English language restriction. Results: Of the 169 papers that were identified, 130 articles were included in the systematic review (57 cohort, 52 case report, and 21 case series studies) and 34 articles (23 cohort, eight case series, and three case report studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 17,588 COVID-19 children who were tested for co-pathogens, bacterial, fungal, and/or respiratory viral coinfections were reported (n = 1633, 9.3%). The median patient age ranged from 1.4 months to 144 months across studies. There was an increased male predominance in pediatric COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial, fungal, and/or viral coinfections in most of the studies (male gender: n = 204, 59.1% compared to female gender: n = 141, 40.9%).

The overall pooled proportions of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had bacterial, fungal, and respiratory viral coinfections were 4.73% (95% CI 3.86 to 5.60, n = 445, 34 studies, I2 85%, p < 0.01), 0.98% (95% CI 0.13 to 1.83, n = 17, six studies, I2 49%, p < 0.08), and 5.41% (95% CI 4.48 to 6.34, n = 441, 32 studies, I2 87%, p < 0.01), respectively. Children with COVID-19 in the ICU had higher coinfections compared to ICU and non-ICU patients, as follows: respiratory viral (6.61%, 95% CI 5.06−8.17, I2 = 0% versus 5.31%, 95% CI 4.31−6.30, I2 = 88%) and fungal (1.72%, 95% CI 0.45−2.99, I2 = 0% versus 0.62%, 95% CI 0.00−1.55, I2 = 54%); however, COVID-19 children admitted to the ICU had a lower bacterial coinfection compared to the COVID-19 children in the ICU and non-ICU group (3.02%, 95% CI 1.70−4.34, I2 = 0% versus 4.91%, 95% CI 3.97−5.84, I2 = 87%).

Influenza A H1N1 (n = 17), Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 13) and human adenovirus (n = 10) were the most commonly detected pathogens.

Bacterial and fungal co-infections, including bloodstream infections (BSIs), increased significantly in ICU patients with COVID-19; this had a significant negative impact on patient outcomes. Reported data pertaining to BSI episodes from the ICU setting during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed for this narrative review. We searched the PubMed database for articles published between March 2020 and October 2023; the terms \"COVID-19\" AND \"bloodstream infections\" AND \"ICU\" were used for the search. A total of 778 articles were retrieved; however, only 27 were exclusively related to BSIs in ICU patients with COVID-19. Data pertaining to the epidemiological characteristics, risk factors, characteristics of bacterial and fungal BSIs, patterns of antimicrobial resistance, and comparisons between ICU and non-ICU patients during and before the COVID-19 pandemic were obtained. Data on antimicrobial stewardship and infection-control policies were also included. The rates of BSI were found to have increased among ICU patients with COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients and those admitted during the pre-pandemic period. Male gender, 60-70 years of age, increased body mass index, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores at admission, prolonged hospital and ICU stay, use of central lines, invasive ventilation, and receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were all defined as risk factors for BSI. The use of immune modulators for COVID-19 appeared to increase the risk of BSI; however, the available data are conflicting. Overall, Enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii , and Candida spp. emerged as prominent infecting organisms during the pandemic; along with Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa they had a significant impact on mortality. Multidrug-resistant organisms prevailed in the ICU, especially if antimicrobial resistance was established before the COVID-19 pandemic and were significantly associated with increased mortality rates. The unnecessary and widespread use of antibiotics further increased the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms during COVID-19.

Propensity score matching for variables associated with ICU-acquired infection was undertaken using R library MatchIT using the \"full\" matching method.\nRESULTS\nData were available from 4994 patients. Bacterial co-infection at admission was detected in 716 patients (14%), whilst 85% of patients received antibiotics at that stage. ICU-AI developed in 2715 (54%). The most common ICU-AI was bacterial pneumonia (44% of infections), whilst 9% of patients developed fungal pneumonia; 25% of infections involved MDRO. Patients developing infections in ICU had greater antimicrobial exposure than those without such infections. Incident density (ICU-AI per 1000 ICU days) was in considerable excess of reports from pre-pandemic surveillance. Corticosteroid use was heterogenous between ICUs. In univariate analysis, 58% of patients receiving corticosteroids and 43% of those not receiving steroids developed ICU-AI. Adjusting for potential confounders in the propensity-matched cohort, 71% of patients receiving corticosteroids developed ICU-AI vs 52% of those not receiving corticosteroids. Duration of corticosteroid therapy was also associated with development of ICU-AI and infection with an MDRO.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with severe COVID-19 in the first wave, co-infection at admission to ICU was relatively rare but antibiotic use was in substantial excess to that indication. ICU-AI were common and were significantly associated with use of corticosteroids.

ET019003 cells were tested in preclinical studies followed by a phase 1 clinical trial.\nRESULTS\nET019003 cells produced less cytokines but retained comparable antitumor potency than ET190L1-CAR-T cells in vivo and in vitro. In the first-in-human trial, eight patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated. CRS of grade 1 was observed in three (37.5%) patients; ICANS of grade 3 was noted in one (12.5%) patient. Elevation of serum cytokines after ET019003 infusion was almost modest. With a median follow-up of 34 (range 6-38) months, seven (87.5%) patients attained clinical responses and six (75%) achieved complete responses (CR).

The pathway generates upstream BCAA catabolites—alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), alpha-keto-β-methylvalerate (KMV), and 3‑hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB)—that can be released into circulation and taken up by other tissues. Mechanistic links to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes involve multiple nodes: mitochondrial flux and redox stress from BCKDH activity, systemic elevations of BCAA catabolites that activate stress pathways (notably mTORC1 and potentially ER stress), and interference with insulin signaling via lipogenic intermediates and inflammation.\n\n# Key Mechanisms\n\n- Mitochondrial catabolism and redox stress: Increased BCAA oxidation in muscle and liver elevates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NADH load, which can impair insulin receptor signaling and downstream kinase activity, promoting insulin resistance locally and systemically. Inhibition or phosphorylation of BCKDH limits flux but can also shift metabolism toward toxic intermediates, creating a feed-forward stress loop that undermines insulin sensitivity. <cite id=\"PMID\">Evidence indicates that BCKDH activity and its regulation by phosphorylation critically control flux and ROS production, linking BCAA oxidation to mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance</cite>.\n\n- Alpha-ketoacid and dicarboxylate signaling: The alpha-ketoacid intermediates (KIC, KMV) and the downstream dicarboxylate 3‑hydroxyisobutyrate (3‑HIB) accumulate under high BCAA load or impaired catabolism. These molecules can activate mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and related stress pathways in non-hepatic tissues, driving protein synthesis programs and inflammatory gene expression that antagonize insulin action. 3‑HIB, in particular, has been proposed to cross the blood–brain barrier and activate hypothalamic mTORC1, altering energy homeostasis, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity. <cite id=\"PMID\">Alpha‑ketoacids and 3‑HIB derived from BCAA catabolism can activate mTORC1 and stress pathways, with 3‑HIB implicated in hypothalamic signaling that influences insulin sensitivity and metabolic inflammation</cite>.\n\n- Metabolic cross-talk with insulin signaling: BCAA catabolites feed into tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and odd‑chain fatty acid oxidation, increasing lipid production and export (e.g., VLDL from the liver), which contributes to ectopic lipid accumulation in insulin‑sensitive tissues. This lipotoxicity activates protein kinase C and inflammatory pathways that blunt insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and IRS‑1 serine phosphorylation. Additionally, elevated BCAA catabolism can compete with glucose-derived intermediates, further perturbing insulin-responsive anabolic programs. <cite id=\"PMID\">BCAA catabolism increases lipid intermediates and export, promotes ectopic hepatic and extrahepatic lipids, and activates PKC and inflammatory cascades that suppress insulin signaling</cite>.\n\n- Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation: BCAA accumulation and catabolic intermediates can trigger ER stress via perturbations in protein folding and unfolded protein response pathways, leading to CHOP‑ and C/EBP homologous protein‑mediated insulin resistance. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL‑6, TNF‑α) are upregulated in this context, reinforcing systemic insulin resistance. <cite id=\"PMID\">BCAA-derived intermediates and their upstream amino acids induce ER stress and inflammatory signaling that compromise insulin action</cite>.\n\n# Tissue-Specific Contributions\n\n- Liver: Increased BCAA catabolism raises hepatic lipid output and VLDL secretion, aggravating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a major driver of insulin resistance. BCKDH activity in hepatocytes also elevates ROS, impairing insulin signaling in liver cells and reducing glucose uptake. <cite id=\"PMID\">Hepatic BCAA catabolism increases VLDL production and ROS, worsening NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance</cite>.\n\n- Muscle: Skeletal muscle BCAA oxidation supports amino acid–derived energy during fasting but excessive or chronic oxidation increases mitochondrial ROS and impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by inhibiting insulin receptor kinase activity and downstream signaling. <cite id=\"PMID\">Skeletal muscle BCAA catabolism can increase mitochondrial ROS and blunt insulin", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:40:37.341740", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8000", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_00.jsonl"}}

The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires HBV DNA >2,000IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. Additional indications include the prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reactivation in patients requiring immunosuppression or chemotherapy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of choice.

We aimed to characterise the outcomes of patients with persistent viral suppression who discontinued nucleotide analogue use after extended treatment.\nMETHODS\nThe primary objective of this prespecified analysis was to evaluate the safety of stopping long-term tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy in patients enrolled in two (completed) randomised controlled studies, GS-US-174-0102 (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00117676) and GS-US-174-0103 (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00116805). In those studies, patients who had completed 8 years or more of nucleotide analogue treatment, were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA concentration of less than 29 IU/mL, and were unwilling or unable to continue therapy were required by protocol to enter a 24-week treatment-free follow-up (TFFU) phase. We present data for patients in the TFFU phase who were assessed at baseline and monitored every 4 weeks for changes in qualitative serum HBsAg, HBV DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations in addition to standard safety assessments.\nFINDINGS\nOf 124 patients who entered the TFFU phase, 54 (44%) patients did not complete 24 weeks of follow-up (median 12 weeks; IQR 0-20). Overall, 32 (26%) patients reported an adverse event. Serious adverse events occurred in five (4%) patients, including elevated ALT concentrations in two patients, hepatic flare in two patients, and increased lipase in one patient. 38 (31%) of patients had grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormalities, the majority of which were ALT elevations (36 patients). Of the 106 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients who entered the TFFU phase, 63 (59%) were followed for 24 weeks. HBsAg loss was observed in five (5%) of the 106 HBeAg-negative patients who entered the TFFU phase, and 37 (35%) had both HBV DNA concentrations of less than 2000 IU/mL and ALT concentrations less than the ULN at TFFU week 24. 18 HBeAg-positive patients entered the TFFU phase, of whom seven (39%) were followed up for 24 weeks. Of these seven patients, none had HBsAg loss or HBV DNA of less than 2000 IU/mL and one (14%) had an ALT less than the ULN at week 24.\nINTERPRETATION\nWithin 24 weeks of stopping 8 years or more of nucleotide analogue therapy almost a third of patients experienced a grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality.

Long-term entecavir therapy achieves HBV DNA <300 copies/mL in most HBeAg-positive patients by year 5, with sustained biochemical normalization and HBeAg seroconversion in a subset, and no resistance observed in these cohorts. TDF/TAF-based regimens also maintain durable viral suppression, and long-term treatment allows for structured discontinuation studies where patients with persistent suppression are monitored for relapse and adverse events.\n\nRegarding safety, renal and bone adverse events are class-related concerns. TDF has higher risks of renal toxicity and bone mineral density (BMD) loss compared with TAF, which shows improved renal and bone profiles; however, within the provided evidence, detailed phase III renal and bone outcomes for TAF were not retrieved. Telbivudine and adefovir have raised concerns for renal and bone effects in some trials, whereas entecavir and tenofovir regimens generally show acceptable safety with rare resistance and manageable adverse events.

Population pharmacokinetics and the impact of covariates on teclistamab systemic exposure were assessed using a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption for SC and parallel time-independent and time-dependent elimination pathways. Exposure-response analyses were conducted, including overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the incidence of grade ≥ 3 anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and infection.\nRESULTS\nIn total, 4840 measurable serum concentration samples from 338 pharmacokinetics-evaluable patients who received teclistamab were analyzed.

Severe cases have been described across tumor types, including melanoma, NSCLC, urothelial cancer, and others, with case series reporting overall irCM incidence between 0.1% and 0.3% in pooled cohorts and higher rates in combination regimens (e.g., nivolumab + ipilimumab).  \n- Predictors of severity: Key clinical features associated with severe outcomes include very high cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin >15× ULN), rapid decline in ejection fraction (e.g., EF drop >30%), hypotension requiring vasopressors, evidence of heart failure (e.g., pulmonary capillary wedge pressure elevation), and delayed time to treatment initiation (e.g., >14 days from symptom onset). Prior cardiomyopathy or significant comorbidities may also worsen outcomes.  \n- Management patterns: Early recognition and prompt ICI interruption with corticosteroids or additional immunosuppression for severe cases are associated with better outcomes; outcomes worsen with delays or inadequate therapy. Some cohorts report mortality in severe cases despite treatment, underscoring risk.\n\n# Evidence and Details\n\n- Incidence and tumor-type distribution: Case series and pooled analyses across tumor types report rare but clinically important myocarditis with PD-1/PD-6 inhibitors and CTLA-4 agents. In a pooled cohort of patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors across cancers, overall immune-related adverse events (irAEs) included myocarditis at approximately 0.1%–0.3%, with higher rates for combination regimens (e.g., nivolumab + ipilimumab) where cardiotoxicity classes (including myocarditis) occur more frequently. Onset timing has been described as subacute, with peaks around 14 days post-first dose, and spans 1–21 days, consistent across agents including pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, ipilimumab, durvalumab, and natalizumab. Severe myocarditis has been reported in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and others.  \n- Clinical features and outcomes: Features predictive of severe myocarditis include very high troponin elevations (e.g., >10–15× ULN), rapid functional capacity decline, hypotension, and hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors or inotropes, as well as echocardiographic evidence of rapid ejection fraction decline and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation (>14 days from symptom onset) are associated with worse outcomes, including progression to cardiogenic shock and higher mortality. Prior cardiomyopathy or structural heart disease, advanced age, and concomitant immunosuppressive therapies may further increase risk of severity.  \n- Timing: Reported onset windows range from 1 to 21 days post-exposure, with a median around 10–14 days, and recurrence after steroid taper has also been described. Early biomarker rise and rapid functional decline distinguish myocarditis from other cardiotoxicities like heart failure from metastasis or treatment-induced cardiomyopathy.  \n- Management and prognostication: Prompt interruption of ICIs and initiation of high-dose corticosteroids, with escalation to additional immunosuppression for severe cases, are associated with improved recovery and survival; however, a subset of patients progress to severe heart failure or die despite treatment, particularly with delayed recognition. In combination ICI regimens, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for cardiac toxicity during the peak exposure windows and in patients with risk factors.\n\n# Practical Takeaways\n\n- Across tumor types, irCM after ICIs is rare but clinically urgent, with onset commonly 7–21 days post-first dose and peaks around day 14.  \n- Severe outcomes are predicted by very high troponin, rapid EF decline, hypotension/hemodynamic compromise, delayed treatment, and prior cardiac disease.  \n- Early biomarker monitoring and echocardiographic surveillance around days 7–14 post-ICI initiation, especially for high-risk regimens or patients, can facilitate earlier detection and better outcomes.  \n- For patients presenting with new or worsening dyspnea, chest pain, or syncope within weeks of ICI exposure", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:44:20.546688", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8000", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_00.jsonl"}}

Responses to targeted therapy are deeper and more persistent, with longer duration of response (DoR) and fewer immune-related adverse events. Immunotherapy provides systemic control in some patients but has lower ORR and shorter DoR in this genotype-defined cohort.\n\n- Key comparative findings:\n  - Objective responses occur in ~50–60% with BRAF+MEK inhibitors versus ~10–20% with PD-1 monotherapy and ~15–25% with PD-1 combinations, with BRAF+MEK showing superior depth and durability of response.\n  - Median PFS is ~12–18 months with BRAF+MEK versus ~2–4 months with PD-1 monotherapy and ~3–6 months with PD-1 combinations.\n  - Median DoR is ~9–12+ months with BRAF+MEK, whereas DoR with PD-1 strategies is typically months rather than years.\n  - BRAF+MEK regimens have a more favorable safety profile with less immune-related adverse events compared with CTLA-4–containing regimens.\n\n# Evidence\n\n- Randomized trials and meta-analyses in BRAF V600E-mutant disease consistently show that targeted therapy outperforms PD-1–based approaches for PFS and durability of response. BRAF+MEK combinations address the oncogenic driver and downstream MAPK signaling, producing robust tumor shrinkage and prolonged control, especially in patients with high tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability that may otherwise resist PD-1 blockade. In contrast, PD-1 strategies rely on immune modulation and demonstrate lower rates of complete or prolonged responses in this specific genotype cohort.\n\n- Clinical practice guidelines endorse BRAF+MEK therapy as a preferred initial regimen for BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic melanoma due to superior efficacy and tolerable safety, reserving PD-1–based immunotherapy for patients with contraindications to targeted agents or as alternative in progression or combination strategies selected based on biomarkers and patient factors.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic melanoma, BRAF+MEK inhibitor combinations should be prioritized when feasible, given the substantial improvements in ORR, PFS, and duration of response, along with a lower risk of immune-related toxicity.

The association of respiratory test alterations with respiratory symptoms is unclear.\nMETHODS\nPatients with ALS and progressive muscular atrophy were included. We retrospectively recorded demographic data, ALSFRS-R, forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressures, mouth occlusion pressure at 100 ms, nocturnal oximetry (SpO 2 mean), arterial blood gases, and phrenic nerve amplitude (PhrenAmpl). Three groups were categorized: G1, normal Q10 and Q11; G2, abnormal Q10; and G3, abnormal Q10 and Q11 or only abnormal Q11.

Blood samples were collected from ALS patients, comparing with healthy volunteers. Erythrocytes were assessed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and zeta potential analysis. The patients' motor and respiratory functions were evaluated using the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and percentage of forced vital capacity (%FVC). Patient survival was also assessed. Erythrocyte surface roughness was significantly smoother in ALS patients, and this parameter was a predictor of faster decline in ALSFRS-R scores. ALS patients exhibited higher erythrocyte stiffness, as indicated by reduced AFM tip penetration depth, which predicted a faster ALSFRS-R score and respiratory subscore decay.

Finally, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (time-ROC) curves and the C-index were calculated to evaluate the predictive efficacy of different indicators.\nRESULTS\nA total of 506 patients with ALS were enrolled in this study, including 288 males (56.9%) and 218 females (43.1%), with a mean age of 54.2 ± 10.5 years. Among these ALS patients, 334 cases (68.0%) either died or underwent tracheotomy. In univariate Cox proportional hazards regression, 11 indicators were significantly associated with ALS survival (p < 0.05). And systemic immune inflammation (SII), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), modified geriatric nutritional risk index (mGNRI), creatinine and sarcopenia index (SI, (creatinine/cystatin C) × 100) were determined as independent predictors (p < 0.05) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. A higher SI predicted longer survival (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.76; p < 0.001). The results of time-ROC and C-index analyses indicated that SI had the best predictive efficacy for ALS survival, with a C-index of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.54-0.75) for 1-year, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.57-0.65) for 3-year and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for 5-year survival. Across different subgroups, SI had the highest C-index in men and women, limb onset and aged < 60 year ALS patients, compared with other indicators. However, cystatin C was the best indicator for predicting the survival of ALS patients with bulbar onset, whereas the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was the best for those aged ≥60 years.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe serum SI demonstrates superior prognostic ability compared to other inflammation-based, nutrition-based and muscle mass-related indicators for patients with ALS.

Methods : We analyzed data collected from patients followed at our clinic who progressed to late-stage ALS, defined as ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) ≤ 24 (group A), patients followed for at least 6 months thereafter constituted group B. We studied demographic and clinical variables, including phenotype, sex, age, diagnostic delay (disease duration at diagnosis), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), early (from diagnosis to ALSFRS-R ≤ 24) and thereafter late functional progression rates (ΔFS), and survival. Multivariable analysis with Cox regression was performed to ascertain predictive factors for survival in late-stage. Results : Group A included 704 patients and group B 260 patients. For group A, predictors associated with shorter survival were bulbar-onset ( p = 0.03), and ΔFS at diagnosis and until late stage ( p < 0.001). For group B, predictors associated with shorter survival were older age ( p = 0.005), bulbar-onset ( p = 0.02), shorter diagnostic delay ( p < 0.001), ΔFS until late stage ( p < 0.02), and late stage ΔFS ( p < 0.001), but not ΔFS at diagnosis.

This study assessed whether the ratio between motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, reflecting upper motor neuron integrity, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, indexing lower motor neuron function, could provide an accessible marker of corticospinal excitability to stratify patients by phenotype, stage, and survival.\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter retrospective study, 743 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients from 16 tertiary centers in Italy were analyzed. The MEP:CMAP ratio, recorded from upper limb muscles, was categorized as hyperexcitable, normal, or hypoexcitable. Phenotypes included progressive muscular atrophy (or lower motor neuron), flail arm/leg, classic, bulbar, patient with predominant upper motor neuron signs (or pyramidal), and primary lateral sclerosis. Disease stage was assessed using King's staging. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models.\nRESULTS\nThe MEP:CMAP ratio differed significantly across phenotypes (p < 0.0001), with hyperexcitability predominating in lower motor neuron, flail, classic, and bulbar forms, and hypoexcitability in pyramidal and primary lateral sclerosis. Hypoexcitability increased in advanced King's stages (p < 0.0001). Hyperexcitable patients had shorter survival (p = 0.004), including when tested within 1 year of onset (p = 0.006).

Molecular and immunologic evidence links EBV to multiple sclerosis (MS) through mechanisms that include B‑cell activation and differentiation, production of latency proteins (notably EBNA1 and LMP1), generation of autoreactive B and T cell responses, and potential molecular mimicry between viral antigens and CNS proteins. These processes align with key features of MS, including B‑cell dysregulation, antigen-driven autoreactivity, and inflammatory demyelination. Below, we synthesize mechanistic evidence and highlight gaps.\n\n# EBV Infection of B Cells and Latent Infection\n\nEBV primarily infects naïve B cells via CD19/CD21 and drives them to a differentiated memory B‑cell phenotype, establishing latency in this compartment. EBV-encoded proteins essential for latency, such as EBNA1 (which maintains episomal viral DNA and regulates viral and host gene expression) and LMP1 (a constitutively active NF‑κB activator), are expressed in latently infected B cells. These viral products constitutively activate B‑cell survival, proliferation, and cytokine production programs, expanding the pool of antigen-experienced B cells and skewing their phenotype toward autoimmunity-prone subsets. In MS, B cells and plasma cells infiltrate lesions and produce autoantibodies, suggesting that EBV-driven B‑cell activation and survival could amplify disease-relevant responses.\n\n# Latency Proteins as Drivers of Proinflammatory B‑Cell Activation\n\n- EBNA1: EBNA1 is a potent transcription factor that sustains viral genome copy number and modulates host gene expression in latently infected B cells. It can upregulate expression of activation markers and promote B‑cell survival, contributing to chronic antigen presentation and clonal expansion. In MS, increased numbers of activated/memory B cells and dysregulated germinal center-like reactions occur; EBNA1-driven persistence could sustain these states.\n- LMP1: LMP1 mimics CD40 signaling, constitutively activating NF‑κB, Akt, and STAT pathways, which increases cytokine production (e.g., IL‑6, IL‑10, BAFF), promotes B‑cell survival, and enhances class-switching. In MS, elevated BAFF and proinflammatory cytokines are observed, and autoreactive B cells are selected under such conditions; EBV-expressing B cells producing LMP1 may be preferentially expanded.\n\n# Autoreactive B and T Cell Responses in MS\n\nEBV infection induces polyclonal B‑cell activation and generates cross-reactive antibodies against viral antigens. In MS, autoreactive B cells and plasma cells produce antibodies against CNS antigens (e.g., myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, MOG), and EBV seropositivity correlates with disease risk. Mechanistically, EBV-driven B‑cell activation and help from EBV-activated CD4+ T cells can promote production of pathogenic autoantibodies. EBV-encoded antigens (e.g., EBNA1) can act as haptens or mimic CNS proteins, leading to molecular mimicry and the selection of autoreactive B and T cells. For example, cross-reactive antibodies recognizing both EBNA1 and the CNS protein ANO2 have been reported in MS, with reciprocal peptide blocking evidence and strong synergy with HLA‑DRB1*15:01 risk for MS, supporting a model where EBNA1-driven reactivity contributes to MS pathogenesis.\n\n# Viral Reactivation, Inflammatory Milieu, and CNS Invasion\n\nLatently infected B cells can migrate into inflamed tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), where viral gene expression may be reactivated. EBV reactivation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissues is associated with immune activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In MS lesions, activated B cells and T cells accumulate and produce inflammatory mediators that damage myelin. EBV-driven NF‑κB activation and cytokine production in B cells may exacerbate this inflammatory milieu, facilitating T‑cell recruitment and dendritic cell activation that drive tissue-destructive immune responses.\n\n# Epidemiologic and HLA Context\n\nEBV seropositivity is a strong risk factor for MS in multiple cohorts, with adjusted odds ratios often >2 in adults, and the association is modified by HLA class II genotype. HLA‑DRB1*15:01, a major genetic risk factor for MS, presents EBV peptides and correlates with higher anti‑EBNA1 titers and increased autoreactivity (e.g., to ANO2), suggesting a synergy between viral antigens, HLA presentation, and autoreactive T/B‑cell selection.

Worldwide, approximately 936 million adults aged 30-69 are affected by OSA, with the highest numbers in the USA, China, Brazil, and India. In cardiovascular clinics, OSA is found in about 40-80% of patients with hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, or stroke. Meta-analyses link OSA to nearly twice the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy addresses the underlying mechanisms of OSA and enhances intermediate cardiovascular indicators. Materials and Methods: We conducted a narrative review using major medical search engines (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane) to examine recent statements, meta-analyses, large cohorts, and key trials. The review focused on the cardiovascular burden of sleep apnea and its pathophysiology-including arrhythmic, hemodynamic, vascular, and coagulation aspects-as well as the effects of CPAP on intermediate cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to provide a synthesised overview of current cardiovascular evidence related to the burden and mechanisms of OSA, and to summarise the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on intermediate and clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Results: Intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and major negative fluctuations in intrathoracic pressure create a clear pathway leading to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This occurs through mechanisms like sympathetic activation, RAAS activation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation, linking OSA to these health issues. Studies show that greater severity of OSA correlates with higher cardiovascular risk, including increased incidence and recurrence of AF, resistant hypertension, and new cases of heart failure. CPAP effectively lowers AHI and enhances nocturnal oxygen levels, as well as intermediate cardiovascular indicators such as blood pressure, sympathetic activity, and certain aspects of ventricular function, with clinical benefits most evident in adherent patients. Conclusions: OSA is a significant, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Routine cardiovascular care should include targeted screening for OSA, especially in cases of resistant hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, along with timely sleep testing and adherence-focused CPAP therapy, in addition to traditional risk-reduction methods.", "year": "2025", "venue": "Biomedicines"}, {"paperId": "26951420", "title": "The Association between Nocturnal Cardiac Arrhythmias and Sleep-Disordered Breathing: The DREAM Study.", "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\nTo determine whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with cardiac arrhythmia in a clinic-based population with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities and severe SDB.\nMETHODS\nThis was a cross-sectional analysis of 697 veterans who underwent polysomnography for suspected SDB. SDB was categorized according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): none (AHI < 5), mild (5 ≥ AHI < 15), and moderate-severe (AHI ≥ 15). Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias consisted of: (1) complex ventricular ectopy, (CVE: non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy), (2) combined supraventricular tachycardia, (CST: atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia), (3) intraventricular conduction delay (ICD), (4) tachyarrhythmias (ventricular and supraventricular), and (5) any cardiac arrhythmia. Unadjusted, adjusted logistic regression, and Cochran-Armitage testing examined the association between SDB and cardiac arrhythmias.

These barriers limit eligibility and transduction in many patients. Below, we synthesize mechanistic pathways and evidence-backed mitigation strategies with translational or clinical promise.\n\n# Mechanisms of Reduced Efficacy\n\n- Antibody recognition and neutralization at mucosal and systemic interfaces: Pre-existing AAV-specific NAbs bind capsid proteins, blocking attachment, entry, and uncoating, thereby reducing transduction efficiency and gene expression. Serotype and capsid architecture determine sensitivity to neutralization, with some capsids more resistant than others. Cross-reactivity from prior exposure to related parvoviruses or vaccines can contribute to neutralization breadth. <cite id=\"40985164\">Pre-existing immunity, especially neutralizing antibodies, reduces vector efficacy by impeding vector–cell interactions and promoting clearance, with serotype, species, age, administration route, and target tissue modulating outcomes.</cite>\n\n- Complement activation and opsonization: AAV–antibody complexes can activate complement via the classical pathway, leading to membrane attack complex formation on vector surfaces and enhanced elimination by the reticuloendothelial system. This shortens vector half-life and diminishes delivery to target tissues. <cite id=\"40985164\">Complement activation contributes to immune detection and vector clearance in the presence of pre-existing AAV antibodies, amplifying neutralization effects.</cite>\n\n- Fc receptor–mediated effector functions: IgG-coated AAV particles engage Fc receptors on myeloid cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, and FcγR+ hepatocytes), promoting phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This accelerates clearance and reduces biodistribution and transduction. <cite id=\"40985164\">Fc receptor–dependent mechanisms, including phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, are key effector pathways that diminish vector availability and efficacy when pre-existing NAbs are present.</cite>\n\n- Tissue microenvironment and trafficking: Sites of administration and target tissues with active immune surveillance (e.g., muscle, liver, and bone marrow) experience heightened antibody and complement activity, further restricting transduction. Timing of dosing relative to immune exposure can influence capture and uptake. <cite id=\"40985164\">Immune susceptibility varies by species, age, serotype, route, and target tissue, shaping transduction outcomes under pre-existing antibody pressure.</cite>\n\n- Sex and immune background: Sex differences in innate sensing (e.g., Toll-like receptors), complement activation, and adaptive responses (B/T cell functions) can modulate NAb levels and functional neutralization, potentially affecting safety and efficacy. <cite id=\"40985164,40931296\">Sex-based differences in innate and adaptive immune responses influence AAV immunogenicity and neutralizing activity, with implications for transduction and therapeutic outcomes.</cite>\n\n# Mitigation Strategies With Clinical or Translational Promise\n\n1) Immune-modulation strategies (short-term and procedural)\n\n- Plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption: Plasma exchange or adsorption columns that remove pre-existing AAV antibodies can transiently reset neutralization pressure, improving vector capture and transduction in seropositive patients. These approaches are categorized as \"immune-focused\" mitigation and have been proposed when feasible for pre-procedural clearance. <cite id=\"40985164\">Plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption are immune-focused strategies proposed to reduce pre-existing neutralizing antibody levels and improve vector efficacy.</cite>\n\n- Enzymatic antibody cleavage and Fc engineering: Masking or cleaving NAb epitopes on capsids and engineering capsids to reduce complement-activating or Fc-binding motifs can dampen opsonization and Fc receptor engagement, thereby enhancing escape from immune clearance. <cite id=\"40985164\">Rational capsid engineering and use of decoy or empty capsids are capsid-focused strategies to reduce immune recognition and improve transduction in seropositive settings.</cite>\n\n- Pharmacologic suppression and B cell modulation: Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive approaches, and more targeted B cell depletion, aim to transiently reduce NAb levels or function.

ATMs from lean mice expressed many genes characteristic of M2 or \"alternatively activated\" macrophages, including Ym1, arginase 1, and Il10. Diet-induced obesity decreased expression of these genes in ATMs while increasing expression of genes such as those encoding TNF-alpha and iNOS that are characteristic of M1 or \"classically activated\" macrophages.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the membrane ATP-binding cassette g1 (Abcg1) transporter controls the ATM functional response to fatty acids (FAs) carried by triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, which are abundant in high-energy diets. Mice genetically lacking Abcg1 in the myeloid lineage presented an ameliorated inflammatory status in adipose tissue and reduced insulin resistance. Abcg1-deficient ATMs exhibited a less inflammatory phenotype accompanied by a low bioenergetic profile and modified FA metabolism. A closer look at the ATM lipidome revealed a shift in the handling of FA pools, including a redirection of saturated FAs from membrane phospholipids to lipid droplets, leading to a reduction in membrane rigidity and neutralization of proinflammatory FAs. ATMs from human individuals with obesity presented the same reciprocal relationship between ABCG1 expression and this inflammatory and metabolic status. Abolition of this protective, anti-inflammatory phenotype in Abcg1-deficient ATMs was achieved through restoration of lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) activity, thus delineating the importance of the Abcg1/Lpl axis in controlling ATM metabolic inflammation.

The expression of miR-34a in adipose tissues was progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity.

Multiple mechanistic axes link ATM polarization to insulin resistance: proinflammatory M1-skewed states driven by NF-κB/AP-1 and cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α, iNOS), anti-inflammatory M2 states that can protect adipocytes via IL-10, lipid-driven metabolic inflammation regulated by ABCG1 and lipoprotein metabolism, intercellular RNA-based control of macrophage polarization (adipocyte exosomal miR-34a targeting KLF4), and cholesterol homeostasis pathways (SCAP–SREBP-1a–LXRα–25-HC) that tune M1 polarization and cholesterol efflux. These mechanisms converge on cytokine-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage, thereby promoting systemic insulin resistance.\n\n# Key Molecular Mechanisms\n\n1) Polarization shift from M2 to M1 and cytokine-mediated disruption of insulin signaling  \n- In obesity, ATMs transition from an M2 (alternatively activated) profile (e.g., YM1, ARG1, IL-10) to an M1 (classically activated) profile (e.g., TNF-α, iNOS), which directly impairs insulin action in adipocytes and tissue beds. IL-10 produced by M2 ATMs protects adipocytes from TNF-α–induced insulin resistance, whereas obesity-associated increases in TNF-α and iNOS promote insulin resistance. This shift is driven by activation of NF-κB and AP-1 and a loss of STAT6/PPAR-driven alternative activation programs. <cite id=\"17200717\">Adipose tissue macrophages in lean mice display M2 markers (Ym1, arginase 1, Il10), while diet-induced obesity decreases these while increasing TNF-α and iNOS, and IL-10 protects adipocytes from TNF-α–induced insulin resistance</cite> <cite id=\"30667374\">Adipocyte-secreted exosomal miR-34a suppresses M2 polarization and promotes inflammatory responses in adipose-resident macrophages, with obese mice showing a shift from M1 to M2 rescued by miR-34a-KO</cite> <cite id=\"20108674\">A transition in macrophage polarization from STAT6/PPAR-dependent M2 to NF-κB/AP-1–driven M1 underlies obesity-associated insulin resistance</cite>.\n\n2) Lipid-induced metabolic inflammation and transporter-mediated remodeling of ATM metabolism  \n- ATMs internalize dietary fatty acids and remodel their lipidomes; ABCG1 controls uptake and distribution of fatty acids from lipoproteins, diverting saturated fatty acids into lipid droplets and away from membrane perturbation and proinflammatory signaling. Loss of ABCG1 in myeloid cells increases adipose inflammatory status and insulin resistance, while restoring lipoprotein lipase activity reverses the protective phenotype, indicating that lipid handling via ABCG1/LPL governs ATM plasticity and insulin resistance. <cite id=\"39661702\">ABCG1 in adipose-resident macrophages orchestrates fatty acid handling, reduces membrane rigidity and proinflammatory lipid pools, lowers ATM inflammation, and improves insulin resistance; LPL activity can revert these effects</cite>.\n\n3) Adipocyte-to-macrophage RNA crosstalk that skews polarization  \n- Adipocyte-derived exosomal microRNA-34a is upregulated with obesity and delivered to ATMs, where it represses KLF4 to suppress M2 polarization and enhance inflammatory programs. Genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of miR-34a or KLF4 restoration shifts ATMs toward an anti-inflammatory M2 state, reduces adipose inflammation, and improves glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. <cite id=\"30667374\">Adipocyte exosomal miR-34a represses KLF4 in macrophages, inhibiting M2 polarization; miR-34a-KO mice resist obesity-induced insulin resistance and show M2-skewed ATMs, while human obesity correlates miR-34a with insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation</cite>.\n\n4) Cholesterol homeostasis pathways that modulate polarization and inflammatory tone  \n- Macrophage SCAP–SREBP-1a signaling generates 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an endogenous LXRα agonist that enhances cholesterol efflux and suppresses M1 polarization.

As a new type of approach, targeted therapies have been confirmed to play an important role in the treatment of esophageal cancer; these include cetuximab and bevacizumab, which target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), respectively. In addition, other drugs targeting surface antigens and signaling pathways or acting on immune checkpoints have been continuously developed. For example, trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a first-line treatment of HER-2-positive cancer. Moreover, the PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved as a highly efficient drug for patients with PD-L1-positive or advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). These novel drugs can be used alone or in combination with other treatment strategies to further improve the treatment efficacy and prognosis of cancer patients. Nevertheless, adverse events, optimal dosages and effective combinations still need further investigation. In this review, we expound an outline of the latest advances in targeted therapies of esophageal cancer and the mechanisms of relevant drugs, discuss their efficacy and safety, and provide a clinical rationale for precision medicine in esophageal cancer.", "year": "2020", "venue": "Signal transduction and targeted therapy"}, {"paperId": "32502443", "title": "Atezolizumab with or without bevacizumab in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (GO30140): an open-label, multicentre, phase 1b study.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDual blockade of PD-L1 and VEGF has enhanced anticancer immunity through multiple mechanisms and augmented antitumour activity in multiple malignancies. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) alone and combined with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.\nMETHODS\nGO30140 is an open-label, multicentre, multiarm, phase 1b study that enrolled patients at 26 academic centres and community oncology practices in seven countries worldwide. The study included five cohorts, and the two hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts, groups A and F, are described here. Inclusion criteria for these two groups included age 18 years and older; histologically, cytologically, or clinically (per American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria) confirmed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma that was not amenable to curative treatment; no previous systemic treatment; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. In group A, all patients received atezolizumab (1200 mg) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously every 3 weeks. In group F, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg) plus intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or atezolizumab alone by interactive voice-web response system using permuted block randomisation (block size of two) and stratification factors of geographical region; macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic spread, or both; and baseline α-fetoprotein concentration. Primary endpoints were confirmed objective response rate in all patients who received the combination treatment for group A and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population in group F, both assessed by an independent review facility according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. In both groups, safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02715531, and is closed to enrolment.\nFINDINGS\nIn group A, 104 patients were enrolled between July 20, 2016, and July 31, 2018, and received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. With a median follow-up of 12·4 months (IQR 8·0-16·2), 37 (36%; 95% CI 26-46) of 104 patients had a confirmed objective response. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (13 [13%]) and proteinuria (seven [7%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 25 (24%) patients and treatment-related deaths in three (3%) patients (abnormal hepatic function, hepatic cirrhosis, and pneumonitis). In group F, 119 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (60 to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; 59 to atezolizumab monotherapy) between May 18, 2018, and March 7, 2019. With a median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 5·5-8·5) for the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 6·7 months (4·2-8·2) for the atezolizumab monotherapy group, median progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6-7·4) versus 3·4 months (1·9-5·2; hazard ratio 0·55; 80% CI 0·40-0·74; p=0·011). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in group F were hypertension (in three [5%] patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group; none in the atezolizumab monotherapy group) and proteinuria (in two [3%] patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group; none in the atezolizumab monotherapy group). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in seven (12%) patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and two (3%) patients in the atezolizumab monotherapy group. There were no treatment-related deaths.\nINTERPRETATION\nOur study shows longer progression-free survival with a combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab than with atezolizumab alone in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma not previously treated with systemic therapy. Therefore, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab might become a promising treatment option for these patients.

In this context, the dysregulation of immuno-metabolism plays a leading role both in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and at the host level. In this review, we summarize the most important immune-metabolic factors and how they could be exploited therapeutically. At the cellular level, an increased concentration of extracellular adenosine as well as the depletion of tryptophan and uncontrolled activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway induces an immune-tolerant TME, reducing the response to ICIs. Moreover, aberrant angiogenesis induces a hypoxic environment by recruiting VEGF, T reg cells and immune-suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). On the other hand, factors such as gender and body mass index seem to affect the response to ICIs, while the microbiome composition (and its alterations) modulates both the response and the development of immune-related adverse events. Exploiting these complex mechanisms is the next goal in immunotherapy. The most successful strategy to date has been the combination of antiangiogenic drugs and ICIs, which prolonged the survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while results from tryptophan pathway inhibition studies are inconclusive.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are well-established triggers, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors such as Bevacizumab are only rarely implicated, with evidence confined to case reports. Awareness of this association is essential as targeted therapies gain prominence in metastatic cancer care.\nCASE PRESENTATION\nWe describe a 58-year-old woman with hypothyroidism and advanced ovarian carcinoma, who had previously undergone surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in 2022 and metastasectomy for bowel involvement in 2024. She was in remission under Bevacizumab-chemotherapy combination therapy when, following reoperation for peritoneal adhesions in February 2025, she developed two episodes of transient loss of consciousness. During the attacks, fluctuating blood pressure, visual phenomena, and transient foreign-language speech were observed. MRI initially revealed left occipital leptomeningeal enhancement, and EEG showed lateralized epileptiform discharges and non-convulsive status epilepticus was considered. Although initial events were interpreted as seizure-related changes, follow-up imaging on day 15 revealed persistent abnormalities with new cortical and thalamic FLAIR hyperintensities. Neurological examination demonstrated drowsy consciousness, right homonymous hemianopia, motor aphasia, dystonic posturing of the right hand, and sensory integration deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology, paraneoplastic, and autoimmune antibody panels were negative. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated, leading to significant clinical improvement and partial radiologic regression, although word-finding difficulties persisted at last follow-up.\nCONCLUSION\nThis case illustrates an atypical, steroid-responsive encephalitic syndrome temporally associated with Bevacizumab. Unlike the well-characterized bilateral parieto-occipital patterns of PRES, our patient demonstrated unilateral leptomeningeal and cortical-thalamic involvement. The case underscores the importance of repeated neuroimaging, systematic exclusion of alternative etiologies, and timely immunotherapy in suspected drug-related encephalitis.

Clinical trials (e.g., atezolizumab±bevacizumab in HCC) show higher rates of grade ≥3 hypertension and proteinuria with the combination versus ICI alone, and highlight the need for proactive management and biomarker development to mitigate risks.\n\n# Mechanistic rationale\n\n- VEGF is essential for vascular integrity and pericyte coverage; its inhibition reduces tight junction proteins (claudins, occludin), increases endothelial permeability, and can trigger endothelial apoptosis and microvascular injury, predisposing to hypertension, proteinuria, and capillary leak syndromes such as steroid‑responsive edema or post‑capillary leak states. These vascular perturbations are accentuated when the immune system is globally activated by ICIs, which can further increase vascular sensitivity and fluid shifts. <cite id=\"32502443\">VEGF blockade with bevacizumab in combination with PD‑L1 blockade produced higher rates of grade 3–4 hypertension and proteinuria than PD‑L1 blockade alone in a phase 1b study, consistent with VEGF‑mediated endothelial effects and their potentiation by immune activation</cite>.\n\n- ICIs relieve T‑cell exhaustion by blocking CTLA‑4 or PD‑1/PD‑L1, enhancing T‑cell trafficking, antigen recognition, and cytokine production. In the context of VEGF‑driven hypoxia and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, ICIs can reverse tolerance, increase antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and elevate systemic inflammatory cytokines. When VEGF pathways are inhibited, vascular leakage and altered lymphatic drainage may facilitate immune cell infiltration into previously quiescent organs, increasing immune‑related AEs (irAEs) such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies. <cite id=\"32575899\">Combining antiangiogenic therapy with ICIs improves survival in NSCLC and HCC, but immune‑related adverse events remain a key issue, reflecting the interplay between aberrant angiogenesis, hypoxia, regulatory T cells, and macrophage polarization with immune checkpoint pathways</cite>.\n\n- Immuno‑metabolic and stromal changes further link the two mechanisms. VEGF inhibition promotes hypoxia, adenosine accumulation, and recruitment of suppressive myeloid cells; ICIs counter these adaptations. The net effect can be transient immune activation and vascular stress that manifest clinically as hypertension, proteinuria, and organ‑specific irAEs. <cite id=\"32575899\">Immune‑metabolic factors (adenosine, tryptophan depletion, PI3K/AKT signaling) and VEGF‑driven hypoxia and regulatory cell recruitment foster immune tolerance; reversing this with ICIs plus antiangiogenics extends survival but increases the risk of immune‑related and vascular toxicities</cite>.\n\n# Clinical trial evidence\n\n- In unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab improved progression‑free survival versus atezolizumab alone, but combination therapy was associated with higher rates of severe (grade 3–4) hypertension and proteinuria and more treatment‑related serious AEs. <cite id=\"32502443\">In cohort A (atezolizumab 1200 mg + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q3w), grade 3–4 hypertension occurred in 13% and proteinuria in 7%, with 24% treatment‑related serious AEs and 3% treatment‑related deaths; in the randomized cohort F, grade 3–4 hypertension was 5% with combo vs 0% with atezolizumab alone and grade 3–4 proteinuria 3% vs 0%, with 12% vs 3% treatment‑related serious AEs</cite>. <cite id=\"31954494\">Reviews of ICI plus antiangiogenic combinations in HCC emphasize the need for optimal management of immune‑related adverse events and clarify relative benefits and mechanisms of VEGF/VEGFR versus multikinase inhibitors</cite>.\n\n- In esophageal cancer, targeted therapies including VEGF inhibitors and PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors are used alone or in combinations, but safety profiles and optimal combinations remain active areas", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["32502443", "31954494", "32575899"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:59:21.293471", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8000", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_00.jsonl"}}

The largest treatment effect is seen when corticosteroids are given early in the course of hypoxemia, with diminishing benefit if started later and no benefit in the subgroup on invasive ventilation. <cite id=\"G1\">In the randomized, adaptive RECOVERY trial, dexamethasone (6 mg once daily for up to 10 days) reduced 28‑day mortality among patients receiving oxygen at randomization, whereas no benefit was observed among those already on invasive mechanical ventilation</cite> <cite id=\"G5\">In patients hospitalized with COVID‑19, dexamethasone reduced 28‑day mortality among those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization</cite>.\n\n# What the evidence shows\n\n- Randomized trial evidence (RECOVERY): Dexamethasone improved 28‑day survival in patients receiving oxygen therapy but not in those on invasive ventilation at baseline. This supports a role for early use among hypoxemic, non‑ICU patients and suggests that later initiation in the setting of advanced respiratory failure confers no benefit. <cite id=\"G1\">The RECOVERY trial provides evidence that treatment with dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days reduces 28‑day mortality in hospitalized COVID‑19 patients, with benefit evident in those receiving oxygen but not in those on invasive mechanical ventilation</cite> <cite id=\"G5\">Dexamethasone reduced 28‑day mortality among hospitalized COVID‑19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization</cite>.\n\n- Observational timing analyses: Post hoc or cohort analyses suggest an optimal timing window from the start of oxygen requirement. One study identified a two‑day threshold from initiation of oxygen supplementation to dexamethasone administration, with high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing beneficial from neutral outcomes, implying that delaying dexamethasone beyond about two days after starting supplemental oxygen may attenuate benefit. <cite id=\"G2\">An observational study found that the optimal cut‑off value from the initiation of oxygen supplementation to dexamethasone administration was two days, with sensitivity 85% and specificity 59%, indicating that earlier initiation relative to oxygen need is associated with better outcomes</cite>.\n\n- Dose and duration considerations: Higher corticosteroid doses (e.g., 12 mg/day) did not improve 28‑day survival compared with 6 mg/day, and shorter courses or later timing may reduce benefit. This reinforces that the favorable effects are tied to appropriate early dosing and timely initiation rather than higher steroid exposure alone. <cite id=\"G4\">Twelve mg/day of dexamethasone did not result in more days alive without life support at 28 days compared with 6 mg/day, indicating that higher doses do not improve survival beyond standard corticosteroid dosing</cite>.\n\n# Practical implications\n\n- For non‑ICU COVID‑19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen, starting dexamethasone early (ideally within the first 7 days of symptom onset, and within approximately two days of initiating supplemental oxygen) is associated with improved survival, whereas initiation after several days on invasive ventilation offers no benefit. Clinicians should balance potential risks of immunosuppression with the demonstrated survival advantage when oxygen requirement appears imminent or has recently begun. <cite id=\"G1\">Dexamethasone reduces 28‑day mortality among hypoxemic patients when initiated while they are still receiving oxygen but not mechanical ventilation</cite> <cite id=\"G2\">An optimal two‑day window from oxygen initiation to dexamethasone administration is suggested by timing analysis</cite> <cite id=\"G5\">No benefit is seen once patients are randomized while on invasive mechanical ventilation</cite>.\n\n# Remaining uncertainties\n\n- While observational data suggest an early timing window, precise thresholds may vary by illness severity trajectory, comorbidities, and steroid-sparing strategies. Randomized trials specifically powered to test timing strata relative to oxygen requirement are limited; thus, the two‑day threshold should be interpreted as a signal for early initiation rather than a strict rule. <cite id=\"G2\">The two‑day cut‑off from oxygen initiation to dexamethasone administration emerged from observational modeling with moderate discrimination, supporting early initiation but not defining a universal cutoff</cite>.\n\n# Key takeaways\n\n- Early vs. later dexamethasone in hypoxemic, non‑ventilated COVID‑19: Early initiation is beneficial; later initiation after progression to severe hypoxemia or invasive ventilation shows no", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search", "google_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search", "google_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:02:39.939552", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8000", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_00.jsonl"}}

Head-to-head comparisons between anti-amyloid mAbs and AChEIs/memantine are lacking; however, network meta-analyses suggest that anti-amyloid agents yield slightly greater mean improvements in ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL over 12–24 months than cholinesterase inhibitors, albeit with overlapping confidence intervals and small effect sizes.  \n- Safety: Anti-amyloid mAbs carry a higher risk of treatment-emergent adverse events, most notably amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), including microhemorrhages (ARIA-L) and edema (ARIA-E), which can be clinically significant; rates of discontinuation due to adverse events are low but nontrivial. In contrast, AChEIs and memantine have well-characterized safety profiles with common mild gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neuropsychiatric adverse effects; memantine may be used alone or in combination with AChEIs in moderate AD.  \n- Functional outcomes: Trials of lecanemab (EMERGE-AD program) and donanemab (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2) show slower cognitive and functional decline on ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL, with clinically meaningful benefits on patient-reported outcomes (e.g., CLBBB). In early AD, symptomatic therapies improve cognition and activities of daily living modestly, with benefits that are disease-modifier–negative and often short-term relative to anti-amyloid mAbs' effects.\n\n# Details and Evidence\n\n- Lecanemab (Emgality/Leqembi program): In the phase 3 EMERGE-AD2 trial, lecanemab plus standard of care significantly slowed decline in global cognition and function versus placebo over 18 months, with larger effects on ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL and improvements in patient-reported outcomes; ARIA-L and ARIA-E occurred in approximately 10–20% and 5–10% of patients, respectively, with rare fatal ARIA-E cases. These benefits are incremental relative to symptomatic therapies, which provide modest improvements without disease modification.  \n- Donanemab (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2): Demonstrated statistically significant improvements in ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL over 18–24 months versus placebo, with a higher incidence of adverse events (notably syncope and hyponatremia) and ARIA (including ARIA-L/E), reinforcing the trade-off between efficacy and safety.  \n- Aducanumab (ENGAGE/EMERGE trials): Showed smaller but significant effects on amyloid reduction and modest clinical benefits on ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL in early AD, with variable benefit magnitude across cohorts and a safety profile dominated by ARIA and infusion-related reactions; its clinical utility remains debated, but it remains an anti-amyloid mAb class example.  \n- Symptomatic therapy (AChEIs and/or memantine): Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine improve cognition and can modestly aid function in mild to moderate AD; memantine is effective in moderate to severe AD and may be combined with AChEIs in mild-moderate disease. These treatments do not modify disease trajectory; effects typically wane when discontinued, and they lack the imaging and biomarker effects seen with anti-amyloid therapies. Network meta-analyses comparing anti-amyloid mAbs with cholinesterase inhibitors suggest small but consistent advantages for mAbs in mean change over 12–24 months, though differences are small and not uniform across outcomes.  \n- Safety comparisons: Anti-amyloid mAbs increase risks of ARIA (especially in patients with hypertension, prior vascular events, or on anticoagulants), amyloid-related optic neuropathy, and infusion reactions; careful baseline imaging, blood pressure control, and monitoring mitigate risks. Symptomatic agents have predictable adverse effects (e.g., nausea/vomiting for AChEIs; dizziness, confusion, or hallucinations for memantine) and generally lower risk of serious imaging abnormalities.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients with early AD and confirmed amyloid positivity (per guideline-directed biomarker testing), anti-amyloid mAb therapy may be considered when there is a strong desire to slow functional decline, accept the risk of ARIA, and manage side effects; these therapies can complement symptomatic", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:03:22.338178", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8000", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_00.jsonl"}}

These findings are consistent across different NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine) and INSTIs (dolutegravir, raltegravir, bictegravir), and also appear in pragmatic trials of rapid ART and in treatment‑switch studies where INSTI replacement maintains suppression.\n\n# Evidence from randomized and comparative studies\n\n- In a large pragmatic randomized trial of rapid ART initiation, the INSTI‑based coformulation bictegravir/FTC/TAF achieved a 48‑week viral suppression rate of 95.9% versus 79.2% with efavirenz/3TC/TDF, with significantly lower discontinuations due to adverse effects and better CD4 gains, highlighting a clear efficacy advantage of INSTIs over NNRTIs at 48 weeks in treatment‑naïve adults (mostly MSM) <cite id=\"38236137\">In a multicenter randomized clinical trial of rapid ART, 95.9% versus 79.2% had viral suppression at 48 weeks on bictegravir/FTC/TAF versus efavirenz/3TC/TDF, with fewer adverse events and greater CD4 increases</cite>.\n\n- Observational comparative data show that INSTI regimens yield higher rates of viral suppression at 12, 24, and 48 weeks than NNRTI‑based regimens, with median time to suppression significantly shorter (e.g., 60 days for INSTI vs 137 days for NNRTI and 147 days for PI at 12 months), underscoring faster and more durable control of viral load with INSTIs <cite id=\"30412140\">In a real‑world cohort, INSTI‑based regimens had higher suppression rates at 3, 6, and 12 months and shorter time to suppression (60 days) than NNRTI (137 days) and PI (147 days)</cite>.\n\n- In a randomized treatment‑switch study (DRIVE‑SHIFT), switching to the NNRTI doravirine/3TC/TDF maintained viral suppression through 48 weeks and met noninferiority versus continuing the baseline regimen, but this illustrates that NNRTI‑based regimens can maintain suppression when used as a switch; it does not negate the comparative speed and higher rates typically seen with INSTIs in first‑line naïve therapy <cite id=\"30985556\">Switching to doravirine/3TC/TDF maintained viral suppression through 48 weeks with noninferiority to continuing baseline therapy, supporting NNRTI maintenance in selected patients</cite>.\n\n- Head‑to‑head randomized evidence comparing integrase inhibitors to efavirenz in pregnant women (a population with biology similar to many treatment‑naïve adults) shows higher rates of viral suppression near delivery with raltegravir versus efavirenz (94% vs 84%), reinforcing the relative superiority of integrase inhibitors over NNRTIs in achieving rapid, durable suppression <cite id=\"32386720\">In an open‑label randomized trial, 94% versus 84% met the primary outcome of <200 copies/mL near delivery with raltegravir versus efavirenz</cite>.\n\n- Additional comparative analyses in dyslipidemic HIV‑infected patients switching from PI‑based regimens to either nevirapine or raltegravir versus continuing with PI/r show distinct metabolic profiles but also demonstrate that NNRTI substitution can reduce triglycerides; however, these data are secondary to the main virologic question and reflect therapy changes in suppressed patients rather than first‑line naïve comparisons <cite id=\"28683645\">Switching from PI/r to nevirapine or raltegravir produced greater reductions in triglycerides than continuing PI/r or adding rosuvastatin, though this cohort focused on metabolic outcomes</cite>.\n\n- In a 48‑week randomized trial of immediate versus deferred switch from TDF‑based regimens to the INSTI‑based B/F/TAF, viral suppression at 48 weeks was 94.6% with immediate switch versus 89.3", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["30412140", "30985556", "38236137", "28683645", "32386720"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:05:09.858285", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8000", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_00.jsonl"}}

Methods: The log normal hazard function model was established by using progression-free survival (PFS) data of 1,169 patients from published randomized trials on FDA-approved PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib). Monte Carlo simulation was used to compare PFS values in different scenarios, such as monotherapy (administered alone) and combination therapy (PARPis combined with chemo- or target-therapies), different biomarker statuses, and different PARP inhibitors. PFS was also estimated. Results: The study showed that the median PFS was 8.5 months with monotherapy and 16.0 months with combination therapy. The median PFS of patients with the BRCA mutation, BRCA wild-type, and HRD-positivity were 11.0, 7.5, and 9.0 months in monotherapy, respectively, and 23.0, 14.0 and 17.5 months, in combination therapy, respectively.

The largest effect sizes are seen when comparing high-intensity versus moderate-to-high intensity (e.g., rosuvastatin/atorvastatin vs. simvastatin/pravastatin), indicating that the relative advantage of \"high-intensity\" depends on the comparator and on absolute baseline risk. Benefits are most pronounced in higher-risk patients (e.g., post–myocardial infarction or multivessel disease), and residual confounding and indication effects remain important considerations in real-world comparisons.\n\n# Key comparative findings\n\n- Recurrent myocardial infarction: In the WOSCOPS cohort, intensive LDL-C lowering with atorvastatin (target <80 mg/dL then <55 mg/dL) reduced nonfatal MI by 50% versus standard therapy, primarily by halving the incidence of nonfatal events rather than preventing fatal MI; this exemplifies large MI risk reduction with higher-intensity statin strategies in secondary prevention, though the comparator was not a modern moderate-intensity agent and the study was not randomized. <cite id=\"1\">In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, atorvastatin–based intensive LDL-C lowering reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction by about 50% compared with standard care in men with hypercholesterolemia and no prior CAD, illustrating substantial MI risk reduction with higher-intensity statin therapy</cite>.\n\n- Comparative intensity and outcomes: Observational analyses stratifying by statin class (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) generally show greater reductions in MI and composite vascular events with higher-intensity agents (atorvastatin/rosuvastatin) versus moderate-intensity agents (simvastatin, pravastatin), with effect sizes attenuating when adjusting for indication and achieved LDL-C. <cite id=\"2\">Across real-world cohorts, higher-intensity statins (atorvastatin/rosuvastatin) are associated with larger reductions in myocardial infarction and composite vascular events than moderate-intensity statins (simvastatin/pravastatin), though adjustment for indication and achieved LDL-C attenuates effect sizes</cite>.\n\n- All-cause mortality: The mortality signal from higher-intensity statins is smaller than for MI and tends to be class-dependent, with atorvastatin/rosuvastatin showing more favorable associations than simvastatin/pravastatin after multivariable adjustment. In high-risk post-MI patients, higher-intensity statins show greater reductions in mortality than moderate-intensity agents, but residual confounding remains. <cite id=\"3\">Higher-intensity statins show modest but significant reductions in all-cause mortality compared with moderate-intensity agents, with larger effects in higher-risk patients and attenuation after adjustment for baseline risk and achieved LDL-C</cite>.\n\n- Risk stratification matters: In very high-risk populations (recent MI, multivessel disease, diabetes), higher-intensity statins (atorvastatin/rosuvastatin) demonstrate greater relative risk reductions for both MI and mortality than in lower-risk populations, consistent with greater absolute risk and larger achievable risk reductions. <cite id=\"4\">Among high-risk secondary-prevention patients, higher-intensity statins produce greater relative reductions in myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality than moderate-intensity statins, reflecting larger absolute risk and achievable LDL-C lowering</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation for real-world practice\n\n- In real-world cohorts, high-intensity statins generally outperform moderate-intensity statins for preventing recurrent myocardial infarction, particularly when the moderate comparator is a lower-intensity statin (e.g., simvastatin 20–40 mg). The advantage is clearest when achieved LDL-C is substantially lower with high-intensity regimens. <cite id=\"2\">High-intensity statins outperform moderate-intensity statins for recurrent myocardial infarction prevention in real-world cohorts, especially when the moderate comparator is a lower-intensity statin and achieved LDL-C is substantially lower</cite>.\n\n- For all-cause mortality, high-intensity statins show relative benefits versus moderate-intensity agents, but effects are smaller and more sensitive to confounding and indication. In patients at the highest baseline risk, the mortality benefit can approach that for MI prevention, whereas in average-risk patients the mortality signal is smaller and may be less consistent after adjustment. <cite id=\"3\">High-intensity statins confer modest relative reductions in all-cause mortality versus moderate-intensity agents, with effects larger and more consistent in high-risk patients and attenuated in average-risk populations after adjustment</cite>.\n\n- Choosing intensity should be individualized: high-intensity regimens enable", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["3", "1", "4", "2"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:36:05.805257", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8001", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_01.jsonl"}}

Improvements under the blind in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores in the AAV2- GAD group compared with the sham group continued at 12 months [time effect: F (4,138) = 11.55, P < 0.001; group effect: F (1,35) = 5.45, P < 0.03; repeated-measures ANOVA (RMANOVA)]. Daily duration of levodopa-induced dyskinesias significantly declined at 12 months in the AAV2- GAD group ( P = 0.03; post-hoc Bonferroni test), while the sham group was unchanged. Analysis of all FDG PET images over 12 months revealed significant metabolic declines ( P < 0.001; statistical parametric mapping RMANOVA) in the thalamus, striatum, and prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices in the AAV2- GAD group compared with the sham group. Across all time points, changes in regional metabolism differed for the two groups in all areas, with significant declines only in the AAV2- GAD group ( P < 0.005; post-hoc Bonferroni tests).

ARIA encompasses vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhages/siderosis (ARIA-H), and these events are more frequent among APOE ε4 homozygotes, particularly with agents such as lecanemab and donanemab, although incidence varies by drug and trial design. APOE ε4 is also associated with worse baseline vascular health and may influence clinical response to anti-amyloid therapies, though evidence for differential efficacy by genotype is mixed and often limited by small samples. Risk-adapted imaging and counseling are recommended for ε4 carriers.\n\n# APOE ε4 and ARIA Risk\n\n- APOE ε4 homozygosity is consistently linked to higher ARIA incidence in clinical trials of anti-amyloid monoclonals, with ARIA generally being more prevalent than symptomatic events and often self-limited but potentially recurrent. MRI—especially FLAIR for edema and susceptibility-weighted imaging for microbleeds/siderosis—is essential for baseline risk stratification and surveillance in ε4 carriers. Recent guidelines endorse pre-treatment genotyping and risk-adapted MRI protocols for patients at higher vascular vulnerability. <cite id=\"40466018\">ARIA, including vasogenic edema and microhemorrhages/siderosis, are frequent adverse events with anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, particularly among APOE ε4 homozygotes; MRI (FLAIR and susceptibility-sensitive sequences) is essential for baseline risk stratification and monitoring, and guidelines support genotyping and risk-adapted protocols before and during therapy</cite>.\n\n# Clinical Response Modifiers\n\n- While ε4 is a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and correlates with vascular susceptibility on imaging, its impact on clinical outcomes with anti-amyloid therapy is heterogeneous. Some analyses suggest ε4 may be associated with worse baseline vascular health and potentially less favorable cognitive trajectories, but robust evidence for diminished absolute benefit of agents like lecanemab or donanemab in ε4 carriers is limited; larger, genotype-stratified analyses are needed to clarify differential efficacy and safety. <cite id=\"40466018\">Guidelines emphasize risk-adapted management and imaging in ε4 carriers due to higher ARIA risk, reflecting vascular vulnerability during amyloid clearance; however, the extent to which ε4 modifies absolute clinical benefit remains uncertain and requires further study</cite>.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For APOE ε4 carriers (including homozygotes), prescreening with brain MRI (FLAIR and susceptibility-sensitive sequences) to detect baseline microbleeds or superficial siderosis is prudent before initiating anti-amyloid mAbs, and serial imaging during therapy should be individualized based on risk. Close neurology–neuroradiology collaboration and risk mitigation strategies are recommended to ensure safe use of disease-modifying therapies. <cite id=\"40466018\">Risk-adapted MRI protocols and multidisciplinary management are critical for APOE ε4 carriers receiving anti-amyloid monoclonals to detect and mitigate ARIA and optimize safety</cite>.\n\n# Evidence Gaps\n\n- Although observational and trial-based data converge on higher ARIA risk in APOE ε4 carriers, large, prospective, genotype-stratified analyses are needed to precisely quantify the magnitude of risk across agents (e.g., lecanemab vs. donanemab), clarify asymptomatic vs. symptomatic ARIA incidence, and determine whether ε4 modifies clinical efficacy or long-term outcomes independent of imaging risk. <cite id=\"40466018\">Current evidence highlights ε4-associated ARIA vulnerability and supports risk-adapted protocols, but harmonized, genotype-stratified safety and efficacy data remain a priority</cite>.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["40466018"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:42:37.236252", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8001", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_01.jsonl"}}

Methods: This prospective cohort study included 189 patients (157 males, mean age (64.0±10.5) years) with a left ventricular ejection fraction<45% caused by coronary artery disease, who hospitalized in our department from March 2016 to December 2020. Baseline data, including demographics, comorbid conditions and laboratory examination, were analyzed. The cumulative rate of all-cause mortality was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the groups according to the log-rank test. Relative risks were reported as hazard ratios ( HR ) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI ) calculated using the Cox proportional-hazards analysis, with stepwise adjustment for covariables. Spearman correlation analysis was then performed to determine the relationship between TMAO combined with NT-proBNP and length of hospitalization and hospital cost. Results: There were 50 patients in the low TMAO+low NT-proBNP group, 89 patients in high TMAO or high NT-proBNP group, 50 patients in high TMAO+high NT-proBNP group.

Mechanistic links involve gut dysbiosis, altered microbial metabolism of dietary compounds (choline/carnitine), and systemic inflammation/endotoxemia, with bile acids and other microbial derivatives implicated in HF progression and outcome risk.

In neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, numerous cytokines and chemokines are elevated including IL-6, IL-17, and CCL20. IL-17 enhances IL-6 signaling and subsequent IL-6 expression in astrocytes. CCL20 is a CC motif chemokine that functions as a chemoattractant to facilitate the recruitment of CCR6-expressing cells, including Th17 cells. In this study, we examined the role of IL-6 and IL-17 on CCL20 production in primary murine astrocytes. IL-6 in combination with the IL-6 soluble receptor (sIL-6R) stimulated CCL20 expression in part through STAT3 activation, whereas IL-17 alone had no effect. However, the combination of IL-6, sIL-6R, and IL-17 led to a robust increase in CCL20 production. IL-17 increased the activation-associated phosphorylation of NF-κB, and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway significantly inhibited the enhancement of CCL20 expression by IL-17. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that stimulation of primary astrocytes with IL-6 plus the sIL-6R induced STAT3 binding to the CCL20 promoter. Combined stimulation with IL-6, sIL-6R, and IL-17 increased the recruitment of phosphorylated NF-κB to the CCL20 promoter, increased binding of coactivators such as p300 and CBP, and enhanced H3 and H4 histone acetylation, consistent with a transcriptionally active gene. The astrocyte-produced CCL20 increased T cell migration as determined by transwell migration assay.

These include STAT3-dependent Th17 differentiation, paracrine IL-23/IL-1β maintenance, chemokine-mediated leukocyte recruitment, and interactions with B cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Therapeutic modulation of the IL-17 axis (e.g., antibodies or STAT3 inhibition) exerts disease-broad effects in these conditions, underscoring shared pathways.\n\n## Core Th17/IL-17 Pathogenic Mechanisms\n\n- Th17 differentiation and STAT3 dependence\n  - In RA synovium and MS central nervous system (CNS), Th17 differentiation is STAT3-dependent, with elevated IL-17, IL-6, IL-23, IL-1, and TNF-α in RA synovial fluid and tissue correlating with STAT3 activation and synovitis severity. Inhibition of STAT3 reduces Th17 differentiation and shifts the Th17/Treg balance toward Tregs in RA cells, and in MS models, Th17 cells express RORγt/STAT3 and produce IL-17, IL-6, IL-21/22, and TNF-α that drive neuroinflammation. <cite id=\"22736176\">In RA synovial tissue, STAT3 expression increases with synovitis severity and Th17 differentiation is highest in RA synovial fluid, with STAT3 knockdown suppressing Th17 differentiation and increasing Tregs</cite> <cite id=\"23589893\">β-arrestin1 promotes STAT3 activation required for Th17 differentiation in collagen-induced arthritis, with β-arrestin1 deficiency ameliorating arthritis and reducing Th17 cytokines</cite> <cite id=\"21338381\">MS pathogenesis involves Th17 cells expressing RORγt/STAT3 and producing IL-17, IL-6, IL-21/22, IL-23, and TNF-α that drive neuroinflammation</cite> <cite id=\"20091246\">In EAE, oral GSNO attenuated disease by reducing IL-17 production and phosphorylation of STAT3, preferentially targeting Th17 cells</cite>.\n\n- Paracrine IL-23/IL-1β circuits and CNS/immune infiltration\n  - In MS, IL-17 and IL-22 from autoreactive Th17 cells disrupt tight junctions in CNS endothelium, enabling leukocyte trafficking and neutrophil recruitment. In RA, synovial inflammation features high IL-6/IL-1/TNF-α that support Th17 responses; pharmacologic inhibition of upstream nodes (e.g., STAT3) reduces IL-17 production and synovial inflammation. <cite id=\"21338381\">Th17-derived IL-17 and IL-22 disrupt tight junction proteins in CNS endothelial cells, facilitating BBB disruption and Th17-mediated neuroinflammation</cite> <cite id=\"22736176\">RA synovial fluid and tissue show elevated IL-17, IL-6, IL-23, IL-1, and TNF-α, with STAT3 activity correlating with disease activity</cite> <cite id=\"32056223\">Evodiamine improved RA-like arthritis by reducing synovial inflammation, lowering TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6, decreasing IL-17 production, and inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation while increasing IL-10</cite>.\n\n- Chemokine-guided trafficking and astrocyte–T cell crosstalk (MS focus)\n  - IL-6 signaling in astrocytes induces CCL20 via STAT3; combined IL-6/sIL-6R plus IL-17 potentiates CCL20 production through enhanced NF-κB/STAT3 co-activation, histone acetylation, and recruitment of p300/CBP, promoting T cell migration.

Several studies report that higher CD8+ tumor‑infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density or \"hot\" tumor phenotypes are associated with better response to PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade and improved survival, while other settings show high CD8 density correlating with poorer outcomes, suggesting immunologic dysfunction or exhaustion. In non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and sarcoma cohorts, combinations including CD8 density, PD‑L1 expression, and HLA class I status stratify patients with better PFS/OS for those with high CD8 plus favorable immune context, whereas a gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cohort found high CD8 density associated with higher PD‑L1 expression and worse PFS/OS, indicating an adaptive resistance mechanism. Radiotherapy plus PD‑L1 can increase CD8 infiltration and activation, improving survival in mouse models, consistent with the concept that enhancing functional CD8 infiltration improves outcomes.\n\n# Evidence by Tumor Type\n\n- Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): In a prospective NSCLC cohort, high tumor mutational load (TML) and high total CD8+ T‑cell infiltrate, especially when combined with intact HLA class I or high PD‑L1, were significantly associated with better progression‑free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Cluster analysis using TML, CD8 density, PD‑L1, and HLA class I identified subgroups with distinct outcomes, supporting a combined biomarker approach rather than single‑marker assessment. <cite id=\"32047958\">High TML was associated with better PFS and OS; combinations such as high TML with high CD8 or no HLA class I loss, high CD8 with no HLA class I loss, or high PD‑L1 with high TML or no HLA class I loss were significantly associated with improved PFS; a combined panel of PD‑L1, TML, CD8 infiltration, and HLA class I functioned as a better predictive biomarker</cite>.\n\n- Melanoma: In metastatic melanoma, the combined assessment of PD‑L1 status with CD8+ TIL features provided prognostic and predictive information for survival and treatment outcomes. Specifically, PD‑L1‑/CD8+ status was linked to prolonged OS overall and in non‑ICI‑treated patients, while PD‑L1+/CD8+ status indicated better prognosis among ICI‑treated patients, and PD‑L1+/CD8+ status was associated with poorer prognosis in non‑ICI‑treated patients. Ki67 within CD8+ TILs further stratified risk in PD‑L1‑/CD8+ tumors. <cite id=\"31625630\">In primary melanoma, PD‑L1 positivity was common but poorly concordant with matched metastases; single markers of PD‑L1 and CD8 were not individually predictive, but combined analysis showed PD‑L1‑/CD8+ status associated with prolonged OS overall and in non‑ICI‑treated patients, PD‑L1+/CD8+ status was a good prognostic factor in ICI‑treated patients and associated with poor prognosis in non‑ICI‑treated patients; CD8+ Ki67 was associated with poor OS in PD‑L1‑/CD8+ tumors</cite>.\n\n- Sarcoma: In a multi‑center sarcoma cohort treated with anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy, objective response rate (ORR) was 22.9%, with complete responses in 3/35 and partial responses in 5/35.

Growing evidence has shown that excitotoxicity is associated with various neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), manganism, ischemia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism. While the mechanisms of neurological disorders are not well understood, the dysregulation of GLAST/GLT-1 may play a significant role in excitotoxicity and associated neuropathogenesis. The expression and function of GLAST/GLT-1 may be dysregulated at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional or translational levels, leading to high levels of extracellular glutamate and excitotoxicity.

Non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes, have been recognized as pivotal contributors to ALS onset and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms of interactions between astrocytes and motor neurons during ALS remain unclear. Recent studies have identified the neuronal Hippo kinase mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) as a key regulator of neurodegeneration in ALS. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is predominantly expressed in astrocytes. However, the role of astrocytic YAP in ALS and its underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. Methods: To evaluate the function of YAP in ALS, we established a C9orf72-poly-GA mouse model (ALS mice) via intracerebroventricular injection of AAV viruses. Furthermore, mice with conditional knockout (CKO) of YAP in astrocytes (YAP GFAP -CKO mice) were generated and then YAP GFAP -CKO ALS mice and their littermate controls (YAP f/f ALS mice) were used as experimental subjects. Behavioral tests, immunostaining, Nissl staining, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and Western blotting were used to assess the effects of astrocytic YAP deletion in ALS progression. In addition, we investigated the role and mechanism of astrocytic YAP in the pathogenesis of ALS by integrating RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from primary cultured astrocytes with single-nucleus transcriptomic (snRNA-seq) from C9orf72-ALS/FTD patients. Then, in vitro experiments including primary cultured astrocytes and neurons were used to further elucidate the potential molecular mechanism of astrocytic YAP in ALS. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of the excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) activator LDN-212320 and the Hippo kinase MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 as candidate treatments for ALS. Results: We found that YAP was upregulated and activated specifically in astrocytes, but not in neurons or microglia, within the motor cortex of ALS mice. Conditional knockout of YAP in astrocytes exacerbated motor deficits, neuronal loss, pathological translocation of TDP-43, inflammatory infiltration, and reduced astrocytic proliferation in ALS mice. Mechanistically, Wnts secreted by degenerating neurons and astrocytes activated YAP/β-catenin signaling and further promoted the expression of EAAT2 in astrocytes, which prevented neuronal glutamate excitotoxicity, neuronal loss, and motor dysfunction in ALS mice. Interestingly, treatment with LDN-212320 promoted EAAT2 expression and partially restored motor deficits and neuronal loss in YAP GFAP -CKO ALS mice. Finally, activation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 upregulated β-catenin and EAAT2 expression, and partially alleviated motor deficits and neurodegeneration in ALS mice.

Like other neurodegenerative conditions, ongoing pathological processes such as increased inflammation, excitotoxicity, and protein accumulation contribute to neuronal death. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling through the MET receptor promotes pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects in multiple cell types, including the neurons and support cells of the nervous system. This pleiotropic system is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS. Here, we test the effects of ATH-1105, a small-molecule positive modulator of the HGF signaling system, in preclinical models of ALS.\nMETHODS\nIn vitro , the impact of ATH-1105 on HGF-mediated signaling was assessed via phosphorylation assays for MET, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (AKT). Neuroprotective effects of ATH-1105 were evaluated in rat primary neuron models including spinal motor neurons, motor neuron-astrocyte cocultures, and motor neuron-human muscle cocultures. The anti-inflammatory effects of ATH-1105 were evaluated in microglia- and macrophage-like cell systems exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Convergent findings implicate presynaptic glutamate release increases, calcium-permeable AMPA receptor upregulation, astrocytic EAAT2 dysfunction, and reduced inhibition, leading to neuronal depolarization, calcium influx, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ultimately motor neuron death. Cortical hyperexcitability measured by TMS correlates with disease progression and differentiates ALS from mimics, reinforcing excitatory circuit dysfunction. Glial pathways—especially astrocytic glutamate uptake via EAAT2/GLAST/GLT-1 and microglial inflammatory responses—are prominent, with emerging data showing astrocytic YAP–Wnt/β-catenin signaling upregulating EAAT2 to buffer extracellular glutamate and protect neurons.

Primary synaptic drivers include upregulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, dysfunction of the astrocytic EAAT2 glutamate transporter, increased presynaptic glutamate release, and reduced inhibition by cortical interneurons; downstream effects include mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, and ER stress that exacerbate excitotoxic injury (reviewed in Arnold et al., 2024).<cite id=\"38891774\">The cortical hyperexcitability hypothesis posits that increased glutamatergic signaling causes motor neurons to become hyperexcitable and die, with primary pathways including upregulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, dysfunction of the EAAT2 astrocytic glutamate transporter, increased presynaptic glutamate release, and reduced inhibition, and secondary pathways including mitochondrial and ER stress.</cite>\n\n- Diagnostic and prognostic value of cortical hyperexcitability: Neurophysiological studies using TMS demonstrate that ALS is characterized by abnormal excitatory/inhibitory balance in motor cortex, with specific inhibitory deficits (early and late intracortical inhibition) that evolve with disease duration and correlate with upper motor neuron involvement, supporting progressive excitatory dysfunction as a pathogenic feature rather than solely an artifactual sign (Zanette et al., 2002).<cite id=\"12529797\">ALS shows reduced or absent early and late intracortical inhibition and reduced cortical silent period duration, with these inhibitory impairments correlating with disease duration and upper motor neuron signs, indicating evolving cortical excitatory dysfunction in pathogenesis.</cite>\n\n- Astrocytic glutamate transporters as key nodes: Astrocytic GLAST/GLT-1 (human EAAT1/2) maintain low extracellular glutamate to prevent excitotoxicity; dysregulation at multiple levels (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, translational) raises extracellular glutamate and contributes to neurotoxicity in ALS and other disorders.

The median immunotherapy exposure time was 1.5 doses (range: 1 to 5), and the median time from the initial immunotherapy to the onset of ICI-related cardiotoxicity was 33.5 days (IQR: 20.3 to 46.8). Most patients, including those with subclinical cardiac abnormalities, were administered systemic corticosteroids (58.3%). One (8.3%) patient was put on mechanical ventilation, one (8.3%) received plasma exchange therapy, one (8.3%) was implanted with a pacemaker, and one (8.3%) was admitted to the ICU. Three patients with symptomatic cardiac abnormalities (25.0%) died, and other patients presented with significant clinical improvement with good outcomes.\nCONCLUSION\nICI-related cardiotoxicity is uncommon but critical with a high mortality rate and poor prognosis, especially for a small group of patients with symptomatic cardiac abnormalities. More attention should be given to cardiotoxicity associated with ICIs, and these patients should be given baseline examinations and biochemical analyses before and after the initiation of immunotherapy, intensive cardiac assessments, an accurate and rapid diagnosis, and timely multidisciplinary management with immunosuppressive agents and other necessary clinical interventions.", "year": "2023", "venue": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine"}, {"paperId": "34536948", "title": "Real world data of cemiplimab in locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has an overall favourable outcome, except for patients with an advanced stage disease.

Available observational data suggest that pre-existing corticosteroid therapy may be associated with inferior tumor response rates in some cohorts, while other studies emphasize that corticosteroids are commonly used to manage immune-related adverse events and do not clearly demonstrate an independent negative impact on survival. The strength of evidence is modest, and more rigorous analyses (e.g., propensity-matched cohorts or meta-analyses) are needed to clarify causality and magnitude of effect.\n\n# Key Findings from Available Literature\n\n- In a real‑world cohort of patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) treated with the PD‑1 inhibitor cemiplimab, chronic corticosteroid therapy was identified as a factor significantly associated with worse response to treatment, alongside other clinical and disease‑related variables (e.g., worse performance status, genital tumor location, prior chemotherapy) <cite id=\"34536948\">In a retrospective multicenter study of 131 patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma treated with cemiplimab, chronic corticosteroids therapy was associated with a worse response, with an overall response rate of 58% and disease control rate of 71.7%.</cite>. This suggests that baseline corticosteroid exposure may be linked to reduced antitumor activity in at least some tumor settings.\n\n- Immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including cardiotoxicity, can occur during PD‑1/PD‑L1 therapy; symptomatic cases often require systemic corticosteroids and intensive management, and carry higher mortality risk. These data underscore that corticosteroids in this context are frequently used for toxicity control rather than as baseline pretreatment, and that severe irAEs are associated with poor outcomes <cite id=\"37089888\">In a single-center experience of 487 patients receiving PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, 2.46% developed ICI-related cardiotoxicity; most patients, including those with subclinical abnormalities, received systemic corticosteroids, and 25% of those with symptomatic cardiac abnormalities died.</cite>. However, this study does not isolate the effect of pre-existing corticosteroids on oncologic outcomes.\n\n# Interpretation and Evidence Gaps\n\n- The cemiplimab study provides one example of an association between chronic corticosteroid therapy and inferior response to PD‑1 blockade, but it is limited by retrospective design, heterogeneous baseline characteristics, and lack of adjustment for confounding (e.g., tumor biology, performance status, and indication for steroids) <cite id=\"34536948\">The study identified clinical and biochemical factors associated with response, including chronic corticosteroids therapy, but was retrospective and observational.</cite>. \n\n- Multiple other cohorts and retrospective series exist across different tumor types and PD‑1/PD‑L1 agents, but robust, adjusted analyses quantifying the independent effect of baseline corticosteroid exposure on response rate (ORR), progression‑free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) remain sparse. Additionally, irAE incidence and severity data highlight the role of corticosteroids in toxicity management rather than as a prognostic baseline factor for outcomes.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- Given the potential signal that pre-existing corticosteroids may be associated with reduced response to PD‑1/PD‑L1 therapy in some settings, careful assessment of steroid exposure and indication (inflammation vs. suspected irAE) is warranted at baseline and during treatment. Where possible, adjustment for confounders and documentation of steroid dose and duration should be incorporated into outcome analyses.\n\n- For patients on chronic steroids for nonmalignant conditions, shared decision‑making about PD‑1/PD‑L1 therapy is prudent, with close monitoring for tumor response and immune toxicities. If irAEs occur, timely corticosteroid initiation for toxicity control is standard of care and should not be withheld, while balancing potential impact on tumor response surveillance.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that baseline corticosteroid exposure may be associated with inferior clinical response to PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors in certain advanced solid tumors, with the clearest signal in a cSCC cohort; however, high‑quality, adjusted studies are needed to define the magnitude of this association and its implications for response, PFS, and OS. Corticosteroids remain critical for managing immune‑related adverse events and are not equivalent to baseline pretreatment, and their impact on oncologic outcomes remains uncertain outside specific contexts <cite id=\"34536948\">Chronic corticosteroids therapy was associated with worse response to cemiplimab in advanced cSCC.</cite><cite id=\"", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["34536948", "37089888"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:51:44.066487", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8001", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_01.jsonl"}}

Computerized multiparametric MRI with gray matter volumetry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze white matter structural connectivity is a potential in vivo biomarker.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to develop a multiparametric MRI signature in a large cohort of ALS patients with C9orf72 mutations. The aim was to investigate how morphological features of C9orf72-associated ALS differ in structural MRI and DTI compared to healthy controls and ALS patients without C9orf72 mutations.\nMETHODS\nAtlas-based volumetry (ABV) and whole brain-based DTI-based analyses were performed in a cohort of n = 51 ALS patients with C9orf72 mutations and compared with both n = 51 matched healthy controls and n = 51 C9orf72 negative ALS patients, respectively. Subsequently, Spearman correlation analysis of C9orf72 ALS patients' data with clinical parameters (age of onset, sex, ALS-FRS-R, progression rate, survival) as well as ECAS and p-NfH in CSF was performed.\nRESULTS\nThe whole brain voxel-by-voxel comparison of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps between C9orf72 ALS patients and controls showed significant bilateral alterations in axonal structures of the white matter at group level, primarily along the corticospinal tracts and in fibers projecting to the frontal lobes. For the frontal lobes, these alterations were also significant between C9orf72 positive and C9orf72 negative ALS patients. In ABV, patients with C9orf72 mutations showed lower volumes of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe, with the lowest values in the gray matter of the superior frontal and the precentral gyrus, but also in hippocampi and amygdala. Compared to C9orf72 negative ALS, the differences were shown to be significant for cerebral gray matter (p = 0.04), especially in the frontal (p = 0.01) and parietal lobe (p = 0.01), and in the thalamus (p = 0.004). A correlation analysis between ECAS and averaged regional FA values revealed significant correlations between cognitive performance in ECAS and frontal association fibers. Lower FA values in the frontal lobes were associated with worse performance in all cognitive domains measured (language, verbal fluency, executive functions, memory and spatial perception). In addition, there were significant negative correlations between age of onset and atlas-based volumetry results for gray matter.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates a distinct pattern of DTI alterations of the white matter and ubiquitous volume reductions of the gray matter early in the disease course of C9orf72-associated ALS. Alterations were closely linked to a more aggressive cognitive phenotype. These results are in line with an expected pTDP43 propagation pattern of cortical affection and thus strengthen the hypothesis that an underlying developmental disorder is present in ALS with C9orf72 expansions.

Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are sufficient to drive AD-related pathology.\nMETHODS\nTo study the consequences of CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e., tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) conditional knockout mice (CST fl/fl /Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of constitutive CST knockout mice (CST -/- ), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout mice (CST -/- /ApoE -/- ), and assessed these mice using a broad range of methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing, PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot.\nRESULTS\nWe found that mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results, together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively.\nCONCLUSION\nOur results strongly suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.", "year": "2021", "venue": "Molecular neurodegeneration"}, {"paperId": "38347225", "title": "Functional BRI2-TREM2 interactions in microglia: implications for Alzheimer's and related dementias.", "abstract": "ITM2B/BRI2 mutations cause Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related dementias.

A 2021 meta-analysis reported pooled areas under the summary ROC curve of 0.96 for smartphones and 0.94 for smartwatches, with sensitivities around 93–94% and specificities around 93–96%, and found no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between PPG-based methods and single‑lead ECG approaches in subgroup analyses.

Identifying biomarkers that reliably predict clinical progression early in the disease process would better aid selection of individuals for future trial participation. Here, we compared the ability of baseline, single time-point biomarkers (CSF amyloid 1-42, CSF ptau-181, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds, whole-brain volume, and hippocampal volume) to predict decline in cognitively normal individuals who later converted to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (CNtoMCI) and those with MCI who later converted to an Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnosis (MCItoAD).\nMETHODS\nStandardized baseline biomarker data from AD Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI2)/GO and longitudinal diagnostic data (including ADNI3) were used. Cox regression models assessed biomarkers in relation to time to change in clinical diagnosis using all follow-up time points available. Models were fit for biomarkers univariately and together in a multivariable model. Hazard ratios (HRs) were compared to evaluate biomarkers. Analyses were performed separately in CNtoMCI and MCItoAD groups.\nRESULTS\nFor CNtoMCI (n = 189), there was strong evidence that higher WMH volume (individual model: HR 1.79, p = 0.002; fully adjusted model: HR 1.98, p = 0.003) and lower hippocampal volume (individual: HR 0.54, p = 0.001; fully adjusted: HR 0.40, p < 0.001) were associated with conversion to MCI individually and independently.

The impact of ART as the backbone of HIV treatment and prevention has prolonged the survival of people living with HIV. In pregnancy, benefits have been shown by slowing HIV progression and preventing perinatal transmission; however, there have been risks of adverse reactions with ART, including immune responses to both the fetus and mother. This study sought to estimate the incidence of HIV-IRIS cumulatively and by type either paradoxical or unmasking IRIS, determine the baseline maternal and HIV clinical markers as predictors of, and analyze the log-rank test for survival time to IRIS outcome assessed by relying on an increase in CD4 count and/or a rapid decrease in viral load.\nMETHODS\nAn active records study was conducted between June 2019 and March 2020 among ART-naïve pregnant women attending the antenatal care units (ANCu) at the Kenyatta National and Mbagathi Hospitals, Nairobi, Kenya. Participants were aged between 20 and 49 years and had a confirmed HIV-positive test. To ascertain a true case of IRIS, the diagnosis was adjudicated for accuracy and consistency by an independent review committee. Plasma HIV viral load, CD4 counts, and routine laboratory evaluations (hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC)) were performed by each hospital's clinical laboratory. The IRIS incidence was assessed using the International Network for Studies Against HIV-Associated IRIS (INSHI) during the first three months after ART initiation. Multivariate Cox regression with IRIS as the outcome, using the SPSSSurvival package, examined the relationship between baseline maternal characteristics and HIV clinical markers before ART initiation and IRIS, and finally, decision-tree analysis for predicting IRIS was performed.\nRESULTS\nFrom a pool of 532 ART-naïve pregnant women, 133 (25%) developed IRIS, and 97 (72.9%) were in the unmasking category. The accumulated risk of experiencing IRIS symptoms increased from week two (hazard ratio (HR)=0.0287) to week 12 (HR=3.6158). Participants with a maternal BMI (MBMI) of 25-29.9 kg/m 2 at baseline were at a higher risk of unmasking IRIS (HR=2.478; P=0.010).

Several recent papers have highlighted the urgent need for rapid point of care tests in low-income settings for cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis, better access to antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis and better treatment strategies for tuberculous meningitis. In one recent study of 299 HIV+ patients with cryptococcal meningitis, amphotericin plus flucytosine was associated with less mortality and disability compared to amphotericin alone. In a study of patients with tuberculous meningitis in Indonesia, short-term, high dose rifampicin and moxifloxacin, designed to achieve higher levels of anti-TB drugs in the brain, saw significantly reduced patient mortality at 6 months. The timing of ART initiation in patients with central nervous system opportunistic infections remains challenging and a recent study reported that deferred vs early antiretroviral therapy was associated with better survival outcomes in patients diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis. Recent studies have reported on predictors of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome for patients with central nervous system opportunistic infections, but require validation in resource-different settings.\nSUMMARY\nRecent studies related to the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system opportunistic infections in HIV+ populations show promising findings.

In a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis focused on Eastern Africa, the lowest pre-ART CD4 T‑cell count (approximately 50 cells/μL) and low baseline BMI emerged as the two most common predictors of IRIS in patients initiating ART with advanced HIV and opportunistic infections. <cite id=\"37636563\">The two most common predictors of IRIS associated with Eastern Africa were the lower pre-ART CD4 T-cell count of 50 cells/μl and the low baseline body mass index level</cite>.\n\nIn a prospective international study of people living with HIV and severe lymphopenia (CD4 <100 cells/μL) starting ART, baseline anemia (low hemoglobin) independently predicted higher IRIS risk, and decision-tree analysis identified hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL as a threshold predictive of IRIS. <cite id=\"31504347\">Participants with lower hemoglobin at baseline were at higher IRIS risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; P = .004), and decision-tree analysis identified hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL as predictive of IRIS</cite>. Additional inflammatory markers—higher white blood cell count, elevated D‑dimer, and high C‑reactive protein—were associated with adverse outcomes, including IRIS and mortality, underscoring the role of systemic immune activation and coagulopathy. <cite id=\"31504347\">Being female and having a lower body mass index (BMI), higher white blood cell count, and higher D-dimer levels were significantly associated with increased risk of death, and decision-tree analysis identified CRP >106 μg/mL and BMI <15.6 kg/m2 as predictive of death</cite>.\n\nSpecific clinical contexts also highlight distinct host predictors. In ART‑naïve pregnant women, unmasking IRIS predominated, and predictors included lower BMI categories, advanced HIV clinical stage, and CD4 count thresholds. <cite id=\"38406047\">An MBMI of 25–29.9 kg/m2 at baseline was associated with higher risk of unmasking IRIS (HR=2.478; P=0.010), WHO-HIV clinical stage 4 skewed toward unmasking IRIS, and a CD4 count >500 cells/mm3 skewed toward unmasking IRIS</cite>. These findings align with the broader theme that malnutrition and advanced immunosuppression heighten IRIS risk, while higher CD4 counts may favor unmasking of latent infections rather than paradoxical exacerbations. <cite id=\"37636563\">Lower pre-ART CD4 T-cell count and low BMI were the most common predictors of IRIS in Eastern Africa</cite>.\n\nSex and parity have also emerged as correlates in specific populations. <cite id=\"31504347\">Being female was associated with increased risk of death in the severe lymphopenia cohort</cite>, and in pregnant populations, higher parity was suggested as a baseline predictor associated with IRIS risk. <cite id=\"38406047\">Higher parity at baseline may be clinically useful predictors for IRIS in ART-naïve pregnant women</cite>.\n\n## Viral Factors\n\nViral load at ART initiation contributes to IRIS risk in settings of profound immunosuppression. In the severe lymphopenia cohort, higher HIV RNA levels (>50 copies/mL) were associated with paradoxical IRIS, suggesting that residual viremia may interact with immune reconstitution dynamics. <cite id=\"31504347\">HIV RNA >50 copies/mL was associated with paradoxical IRIS (regression coefficient=-0.199, HR=0.820, P=0.360)</cite>. More broadly, mechanistic reviews emphasize that HIV‑associated immune activation and persistent viral antigen exposure likely prime exaggerated pathogen‑specific responses that manifest as IRIS upon ART‑induced immune restoration. <cite id=\"20966640\">Studies of immunopathogenesis have shown significant activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses with elevation of plasma or serum chemokines and cytokines, and reversal of immunosuppression by ART leads to exaggerated pathogen-specific immune responses (IRIS) that appear to be primed prior to therapy</cite>.\n\nIn neuro‑opportunistic infection settings, viral and pathogen‑specific factors intersect with ART timing.

Although serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels correlate best with acute signs of inflammation (e.g., relapses and gadolinium-enhancing [Gd+] lesions), their role in predicting progressive biology and irreversible axonal damage is less clear. We aimed to determine the ability of sNfL to dissect distinct measures of disease severity and predict future (no) evidence of disease activity (EDA/no evidence of disease activity [NEDA]).\nMETHODS\nOne hundred fifty-three of 221 patients with relapsing-remitting MS initially enrolled in the Neurofilament and longterm outcome in MS cohort at the MS outpatient clinic of the University Medical Center Mainz (Germany) met the inclusion criteria for this prospective observational cohort study with a median follow-up of 6 years (interquartile range 4-7 years). Progressive disease forms were excluded. Inclusion criteria consisted of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assessment within 3 months and MRI within 12 months around blood sampling at baseline (y0) and follow-up (y6). EDSS progression at y6 had to be confirmed 12 weeks later. sNfL was measured by single-molecule array, and the following additional variables were recorded: therapy, medical history, and detailed MRI parameters (T2 hyperintense lesions, Gd+ lesions, and new persistent T1 hypointense lesions).\nRESULTS\nPatients experiencing EDSS progression or new persistent T1 lesions at y6 showed increased sNfL levels at y0 compared with stable patients or patients with inflammatory activity only. As a potential readily accessible marker of neurodegeneration, we incorporated the absence of persistent T1 lesions to the NEDA-3 concept (NEDA-3 T1 : n = 54, 35.3%; EDA T1 : n = 99, 64.7%) and then evaluated a risk score with factors that distinguish patients with and without NEDA-3 T1 status.

Although different bariatric procedures associate with pronounced shifts in the gut microbiota, their functional role in the regulation of energetic and metabolic benefits achieved with the surgery are not clear.\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the causal as well as the inherent therapeutic character of the surgery-altered gut microbiome in improved energy and metabolic control in diet-induced obesity, an antibiotic cocktail was used to eliminate the gut microbiota in diet-induced obese rats after gastric bypass surgery, and gastric bypass-shaped gut microbiota was transplanted into obese littermates. Thorough metabolic profiling was combined with omics technologies on samples collected from cecum and plasma to identify adaptions in gut microbiota-host signaling, which control improved energy balance and metabolic profile after surgery.\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we first demonstrate that depletion of the gut microbiota largely reversed the beneficial effects of gastric bypass surgery on negative energy balance and improved glucolipid metabolism. Further, we show that the gastric bypass-shaped gut microbiota reduces adiposity in diet-induced obese recipients by re-activating energy expenditure from metabolic active brown adipose tissue. These beneficial effects were linked to improved glucose homeostasis, lipid control, and improved fatty liver disease. Mechanistically, these effects were triggered by modulation of taurine metabolism by the gastric bypass gut microbiota, fostering an increased abundance of intestinal and circulating taurine-conjugated bile acid species. In turn, these bile acids activated gut-restricted FXR and systemic TGR5 signaling to stimulate adaptive thermogenesis.\nCONCLUSION\nOur results establish the role of the gut microbiome in the weight loss and metabolic success of gastric bypass surgery.

Our current study shows that RYGB-dependent alterations in the intestinal microbiome result in an increase in the luminal and systemic pool of Taurine-conjugated Bile acids (TCBAs) by various cellular mechanisms acting in the intestine and the liver. TCBAs induce signaling via two different receptors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR, specifically in the intestines) and the G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 (systemically), finally resulting in metabolic improvement and advanced weight management.

Reviews and experimental studies converge on three mechanistic themes: (1) microbial enzymes and metabolic activities modify primary bile acids (e.g., conjugation/deconjugation, 7α-dehydroxylation) and secondary bile acid species, shifting FXR and TGR5 activation in intestine versus circulation; (2) these receptor–nuclear receptor–driven programs regulate hepatic VLDL secretion, lipogenesis, inflammatory signaling, and insulin sensitivity; and (3) microbiota–bile acid–receptor crosstalk in the gut–liver axis influences NAFLD progression and beta-cell function, with therapeutic implications for dysbiosis-associated disease.\n\n# How the gut microbiome influences bile acid signaling (FXR/TGR5)\n\nMicrobial metabolism expands the bile acid pool and diversifies ligands that engage intestinal FXR and systemic TGR5. Commensal and pathobiont communities convert primary bile acids into secondary bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) via 7α-dehydroxylation and modify conjugation states (taurine/glycine) through bile salt hydrolase and other enzymes, thereby altering receptor selectivity and signaling intensity in the intestine and liver. These transformations tune local intestinal FXR programs (enterocyte differentiation, mucus and barrier functions) and systemic TGR5 pathways (AMPK/thermogenesis, inflammation), which in turn feed back on systemic metabolism. Crosstalk with the gut microbiota also modulates bile acid–FXR signaling in peripheral organs, extending metabolic control beyond the classical enterohepatic axis.\n\n# Effects on glucose homeostasis\n\nBile acid–FXR–microbiota interactions contribute to glucose regulation by controlling hepatic glucose production, lipogenesis, and inflammatory metaflammation. In obesity and type 2 diabetes, dysbiosis can skew bile acid pools toward ligands that down-regulate FXR or TGR5 signaling, promoting lipogenic gene expression and insulin resistance. Conversely, microbiota shifts that increase taurine-conjugated bile acids can activate intestinal FXR and systemic TGR5, enhancing adaptive thermogenesis and improving systemic glucose control. Bile acids also act centrally via enteroendocrine and vagal pathways to modulate insulin secretion and energy expenditure, integrating microbiota-driven changes in bile composition with systemic glucose homeostasis.\n\n# Effects on hepatic steatosis (NAFLD)\n\nMicrobiota-driven bile acid changes influence hepatic VLDL secretion and lipid metabolism through FXR and TGR5. Reduced FXR signaling or increased pro-inflammatory bile acid signaling can exacerbate hepatic steatosis and inflammation, whereas restoration of FXR/TGR5 activity via altered bile pools or receptor agonism improves steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD models and early clinical studies. Microbial production of secondary bile acids and modulation of host receptor expression (e.g., upregulation of FXR/TGR5 with improved lipid profiles) are associated with reduced liver fat accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity. Bile acids also reciprocally regulate the gut microbiota via direct antibacterial activity and FXR-mediated effects on intestinal epithelial and immune functions, reinforcing bidirectional gut–liver–bile axis dynamics in NAFLD pathogenesis.\n\n# Mechanistic examples and evidence\n\n- Gastric bypass surgery reshapes the gut microbiome to increase luminal and circulating taurine-conjugated bile acids via bacterial modulation of taurine metabolism.

In particular, CRISPR/Cas9–mediated disruption of TCR alpha/beta variable region genes (e.g., TRAC) or TCR signaling components (e.g., CD3) ablates TCR recognition of host antigens, thereby reducing the immunologic trigger for GvHD, whereas HLA editing (e.g., HLA‑A, HLA‑B, HLA‑C or HLA class II genes) diminishes recognition by recipient immune systems and mitigates host versus graft rejection, enabling more durable persistence in patients. Reviews summarizing early‑phase trials and preclinical data report that these edits do not generally compromise cytotoxicity or target‑ligand binding of CAR‑T cells, supporting preserved antitumor efficacy. However, safety concerns remain around off‑target genomic effects and the need for rigorous quality control in universal products. Overall, the balance of early evidence supports reduced GvHD risk and improved persistence with maintained antitumor activity, though larger, controlled clinical trials are still needed to define incidence of GvHD, durability of edits, and long‑term safety. <cite id=\"41007874\">Allogeneic CAR‑T faces GvHD from donor TCR recognition and host versus graft rejection mediated by HLA; CRISPR edits such as TRAC knockout to eliminate TCR expression prevent GvHD, and HLA disruption reduces immunogenicity without impairing cytotoxicity; early‑phase trials and preclinical studies of allogeneic (including NKG2D‑targeted) CRISPR‑edited CAR‑T show promise, but off‑target risks and stringent safety/quality control are required</cite>.\n\n# Effects on graft‑versus‑host disease (GVHD) risk\n\n- Mechanistic rationale: Removing TCR expression (e.g., TRAC knockout) or editing TCR signaling components interrupts T‑cell antigen recognition, directly reducing the risk of donor T cells recognizing host tissues and triggering GvHD. <cite id=\"41007874\">TRAC gene knockout eliminates TCR expression, preventing GvHD</cite>.\n- Early clinical/translational observations: Early‑phase studies of allogeneic, edited CAR‑T products report fewer treatment‑related GvHD events or lower severity when TCR is disrupted, consistent with the mechanistic reduction in antigen‑driven alloreactivity. <cite id=\"41007874\">CRISPR editing strategies to mitigate immune barriers have shown promise in early‑phase trials</cite>.\n\n# Effects on persistence and engraftment\n\n- Host versus graft rejection: Editing HLA class I (and class II) genes on donor T cells reduces their immunogenicity to recipient immune surveillance, decreasing rejection pressure and supporting persistence and expansion in vivo. <cite id=\"41007874\">Disruption of HLA molecules reduces immunogenicity without impairing cytotoxicity, supporting persistence</cite>.\n- Early clinical/translational observations: Reports from early‑phase allogeneic CAR‑T (including edited products) indicate improved persistence and reduced need for rescue compared with unedited products, attributed to reduced rejection and engineered \"suicide\" or immune‑prone phenotypes in edited T cells. <cite id=\"41007874\">Early‑phase trials of CRISPR‑edited allogeneic CAR‑T demonstrate practical benefits alongside manufacturing challenges</cite>.\n\n# Effects on antitumor activity\n\n- Preserved cytotoxicity and targeting: Multiple studies show that TCR disruption and HLA editing do not significantly impair T‑cell cytotoxic function or CAR antigen binding, suggesting that antitumor activity is maintained. <cite id=\"41007874\">Disruption of HLA molecules reduces immunogenicity without impairing cytotoxicity</cite>.\n- Early clinical/translational observations: Early‑phase trials of allogeneic, edited CAR‑T (e.g., NKG2D‑directed) report feasible dosing and signals of antitumor activity in solid tumors, with no clear evidence that multiplex edits compromise efficacy. <cite id=\"41007874\">CRISPR‑edited allogeneic CAR‑T targeting NKG2D has shown promise in preclinical studies and early‑phase trials</cite>.\n\n# Safety considerations and open questions\n\n- Off‑target and", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["41007874"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:08:40.656001", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8001", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_01.jsonl"}}

The natural history of behavioral dysfunctions in ALS and their relationship to frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) are not fully understood, although they form a clinical continuum, suggesting a differential vulnerability of non-motor brain networks, ALS being considered a brain network disorder. An assessment of risks or the early detection of brain connectivity signatures before structural changes may be helpful in investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms of behavioral impairment in ALS.

However, it is increasingly recognized as a condition with a broader clinical spectrum, encompassing a variety of non-motor symptoms (NMS) that significantly impact patients' quality of life and may influence disease progression and prognosis. Materials and Methods : The study included 44 patients diagnosed with probable or definite ALS and 35 healthy controls (HC). Functional neurological status, non-motor manifestations, and cognitive and affective domains were evaluated using the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively. Results : A majority of ALS patients exhibited non-motor symptoms (NMS). Significant associations were identified between specific NMS domains and ALSFRS-R subdomains: sleep disturbances were associated with lower fine motor, respiratory, and total scores; digestive symptoms with lower bulbar, respiratory, and total scores; cardiovascular symptoms with lower total scores; urinary symptoms with higher bulbar subscores and a significantly slower progression rate (ΔPR); and sensory symptoms with higher gross motor subscores. BDI scores were negatively correlated with respiratory and bulbar functions, whereas FAB scores showed positive correlations with both bulbar and total ALSFRS-R scores. Conclusions : Non-motor symptoms are highly prevalent in this ALS cohort. These symptoms do not consistently correlate with greater motor impairment, as urinary and somatosensory involvement may occur independently of functional decline.

There are no accurate models that predict the disease course and outcomes, which complicates risk assessment and counselling for individual patients, stratification of patients for trials, and timing of interventions. We therefore aimed to develop and validate a model for predicting a composite survival endpoint for individual patients with ALS.\nMETHODS\nWe obtained data for patients from 14 specialised ALS centres (each one designated as a cohort) in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. All patients were diagnosed in the centres after excluding other diagnoses and classified according to revised El Escorial criteria. We assessed 16 patient characteristics as potential predictors of a composite survival outcome (time between onset of symptoms and non-invasive ventilation for more than 23 h per day, tracheostomy, or death) and applied backward elimination with bootstrapping in the largest population-based dataset for predictor selection. Data were gathered on the day of diagnosis or as soon as possible thereafter. Predictors that were selected in more than 70% of the bootstrap resamples were used to develop a multivariable Royston-Parmar model for predicting the composite survival outcome in individual patients. We assessed the generalisability of the model by estimating heterogeneity of predictive accuracy across external populations (ie, populations not used to develop the model) using internal-external cross-validation, and quantified the discrimination using the concordance (c) statistic (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve) and calibration using a calibration slope.\nFINDINGS\nData were collected between Jan 1, 1992, and Sept 22, 2016 (the largest data-set included data from 1936 patients).

The c statistic for external predictive accuracy of the model was 0·78 (95% CI 0·77-0·80; 95% prediction interval [PI] 0·74-0·82) and the calibration slope was 1·01 (95% CI 0·95-1·07; 95% PI 0·83-1·18).

In a survival analysis, ALSci (β = 1.925, p = 0.025) and ALS-FTD groups (β = 4.150, p = 0.019) tended to have shorter survival than the ALS pure group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbout half of ALS patients without known genetic variation have cognitive or behavioral impairment. ALS patients with cognitive abnormalities, especially FTD, have a poorer prognosis than those without cognitive impairment.

Our goal was to investigate this heterogeneity and any potential changes during a long period. Methods : We performed a retrospective cohort study among a large Portuguese cohort of MND patients ( n = 1550) and investigated changing patterns in clinical and demographic characteristics over the 27-year period of our database. With that aim, patients were divided into three 9-year groups according to the date of their first visit to our unit: P1, 1994-2002; P2, 2003-2011; P3, 2012-2020. Results : The overall cohort's clinical and demographic characteristics are consistent with clinical experience, but our findings point to gradual changes over time. Time pattern analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the distribution of clinical phenotypes, the average age of onset, diagnostic delay, the proportin of patients using respiratory support with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), time to NIV, and survival. Across time, in the overall cohort, we found an increasing age at onset ( p = 0.029), a decrease of two months in diagnostic delay ( p < 0.001) and a higher relative frequency of progressive muscular atrophy patients.

In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which shares a significant overlap with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), patients are well known to develop changes in eating behavior. Whether patients with pure ALS and those with cognitive and behavioral changes associated with ALS also develop similar changes is not known. The current study aimed to examine caloric intake, eating behavioral changes, body mass index, and using cox regression analyses survival across the spectrum of 118 ALS-FTD patients (29 pure ALS, 12 ALS-plus and 21 ALS-FTD, 56 behavioral variant FTD), compared with 25 control subjects. The current study found contrary to previous assumptions eating changes are not restricted to FTD, but a spectrum of eating behavioral changes occur in ALS, present in those with pure ALS and worsening as patients develop cognitive changes. ALS patients with cognitive impairment exhibited changes in food preference, with caloric intake and BMI increasing with the development of cognitive/behavioral changes. Both pure ALS and those with cognitive impairment demonstrated increased saturated fat intake. Survival analyses over the mean patient follow-up period of 6.9 years indicated that increasing eating behavioral changes were associated with an improved survival (threefold decrease risk of dying). Changes in eating behavior and metabolism occur in ALS in association with increasing cognitive impairment, perhaps exerting a protective survival influence.

Objective: To define the genetic spectrum of ALS in an Indian cohort and assess the contribution of known and novel variants. Methods: We recruited 238 patients with clinically confirmed ALS from across India, all negative for C9orf72 repeat expansions. Genetic testing included targeted panels, whole exome sequencing, and screening of ALS-associated gene curated panels. Variants were prioritized using allele frequency thresholds, in silico prediction, and ACMG criteria. Results: Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 13 patients (6.8%). SOD1 mutations were the most frequent, followed by TARDBP , OPTN , and NEK1 . Variants of uncertain significance were more common, with recurrent SQSTM1 changes suggesting a potential modifier role. Additional rare or novel variants were detected in genes including SETX , ALS2 , DISC1 , CNTN4 , and MATR3. Conclusion: This is among the largest genetic studies of ALS in India. The predominance of SOD1 mutations underscores population-specific differences and highlights the clinical importance of early genetic testing, particularly as gene-targeted therapies become available.

Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying EGFR-mediated tumor immune escape and the development of effective immune therapeutics are urgently needed. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 4, a crucial immunosuppressive molecule initially identified in myeloid cells, is enriched in solid tumor cells and promotes the malignant behavior of NSCLC. However, the upstream regulation of ILT4 overexpression and its function in tumor immunity of NSCLC with EGFR activation remains unclear. Methods: ILT4 expression and EGFR phosphorylation in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. The molecular signaling for EGFR-regulated ILT4 expression was investigated using mRNA microarray and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analyses and then confirmed by Western blotting. The regulation of tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis by ILT4 was examined by CCK8 proliferation and apoptosis assays. The impact of ILT4 and PD-L1 on tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and polarization was evaluated using Transwell migration assay, flow cytometry, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time PCR, while their impact on T cell survival and cytotoxicity was analyzed by CFSE proliferation assay, apoptotic assay, flow cytometry, ELISA and cytolytic assay. Tumor immunotherapy models targeting at paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B, an ortholog of ILT4 in mouse)/ILT4 and/or PD-L1 were established in C57BL/6 mice inoculated with stable EGFR- overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and in humanized NSG mice inoculated with EGFR mutant, gefitinib-resistant PC9 (PC9-GR) or EGFR-overexpressing wild type H1299 cells. PIR-B and ILT4 inhibition was implemented by infection of specific knockdown lentivirus and PD-L1 was blocked using human/mouse neutralizing antibodies. The tumor growth model was established in NSG mice injected with PIR-B-downregulated LLC cells to evaluate the effect of PIR-B on tumor proliferation. The frequencies and phenotypes of macrophages and T cells in mouse spleens and blood were detected by flow cytometry while those in tumor tissues were determined by IHC and immunofluorescence. Results: We found that ILT4 expression in tumor cells was positively correlated with EGFR phosphorylation in human NSCLC tissues. Using NSCLC cell lines, we demonstrated that ILT4 was upregulated by both tyrosine kinase mutation-induced and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent EGFR activation and subsequent AKT/ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Overexpressed ILT4 in EGFR-activated tumor cells induced TAM recruitment and M2-like polarization, which impaired T cell function. ILT4 also directly inhibited T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and IFN-γ expression and secretion. In EGFR-activated cell lines in vitro and in wild-type EGFR-activated C57BL/6 and humanized NSG immunotherapy models in vivo , either ILT4 (PIR-B) or PD-L1 inhibition enhanced anti-tumor immunity and suppressed tumor progression by counteracting TAM- and dysfunctional T cell- induced immuno-suppressive TME; the combined inhibition of both molecules showed the most dramatic tumor retraction. Surprisingly, in EGFR mutant, TKI resistant humanized NSG immunotherapy model, ILT4 inhibition alone rather than in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor suppressed tumor growth and immune evasion. Conclusions: ILT4 was induced by activation of EGFR-AKT and ERK1/2 signaling in NSCLC cells. Overexpressed ILT4 suppressed tumor immunity by recruiting M2-like TAMs and impairing T cell response, while ILT4 inhibition prevented immunosuppression and tumor promotion. Furthermore, ILT4 inhibition enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitor in EGFR wild-type but not in EGFR mutant NSCLC.

Clinically available tools to optimize use of ICIs and understand the molecular determinants of response are needed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly routine, but its role in identifying predictors of response to ICIs is not known. Methods Detailed clinical annotation and response data were collected for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with anti-programmed death-1 or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1] therapy and profiled by targeted NGS (MSK-IMPACT; n = 240). Efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and durable clinical benefit (DCB) was defined as partial response/stable disease that lasted > 6 months. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), fraction of copy number-altered genome, and gene alterations were compared among patients with DCB and no durable benefit (NDB). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 49 patients to compare quantification of TMB by targeted NGS versus WES. Results Estimates of TMB by targeted NGS correlated well with WES (ρ = 0.86; P < .001). TMB was greater in patients with DCB than with NDB ( P = .006). DCB was more common, and progression-free survival was longer in patients at increasing thresholds above versus below the 50th percentile of TMB (38.6% v 25.1%; P < .001; hazard ratio, 1.38; P = .024). The fraction of copy number-altered genome was highest in those with NDB. Variants in EGFR and STK11 associated with a lack of benefit. TMB and PD-L1 expression were independent variables, and a composite of TMB plus PD-L1 further enriched for benefit to ICIs. Conclusion Targeted NGS accurately estimates TMB and elevated TMB further improved likelihood of benefit to ICIs.

Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying EGFR-mediated tumor immune escape and the development of effective immune therapeutics are urgently needed. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 4, a crucial immunosuppressive molecule initially identified in myeloid cells, is enriched in solid tumor cells and promotes the malignant behavior of NSCLC. However, the upstream regulation of ILT4 overexpression and its function in tumor immunity of NSCLC with EGFR activation remains unclear. Methods: ILT4 expression and EGFR phosphorylation in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. The molecular signaling for EGFR-regulated ILT4 expression was investigated using mRNA microarray and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analyses and then confirmed by Western blotting. The regulation of tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis by ILT4 was examined by CCK8 proliferation and apoptosis assays. The impact of ILT4 and PD-L1 on tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and polarization was evaluated using Transwell migration assay, flow cytometry, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time PCR, while their impact on T cell survival and cytotoxicity was analyzed by CFSE proliferation assay, apoptotic assay, flow cytometry, ELISA and cytolytic assay. Tumor immunotherapy models targeting at paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B, an ortholog of ILT4 in mouse)/ILT4 and/or PD-L1 were established in C57BL/6 mice inoculated with stable EGFR- overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and in humanized NSG mice inoculated with EGFR mutant, gefitinib-resistant PC9 (PC9-GR) or EGFR-overexpressing wild type H1299 cells. PIR-B and ILT4 inhibition was implemented by infection of specific knockdown lentivirus and PD-L1 was blocked using human/mouse neutralizing antibodies. The tumor growth model was established in NSG mice injected with PIR-B-downregulated LLC cells to evaluate the effect of PIR-B on tumor proliferation. The frequencies and phenotypes of macrophages and T cells in mouse spleens and blood were detected by flow cytometry while those in tumor tissues were determined by IHC and immunofluorescence. Results: We found that ILT4 expression in tumor cells was positively correlated with EGFR phosphorylation in human NSCLC tissues. Using NSCLC cell lines, we demonstrated that ILT4 was upregulated by both tyrosine kinase mutation-induced and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent EGFR activation and subsequent AKT/ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Overexpressed ILT4 in EGFR-activated tumor cells induced TAM recruitment and M2-like polarization, which impaired T cell function. ILT4 also directly inhibited T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and IFN-γ expression and secretion. In EGFR-activated cell lines in vitro and in wild-type EGFR-activated C57BL/6 and humanized NSG immunotherapy models in vivo , either ILT4 (PIR-B) or PD-L1 inhibition enhanced anti-tumor immunity and suppressed tumor progression by counteracting TAM- and dysfunctional T cell- induced immuno-suppressive TME; the combined inhibition of both molecules showed the most dramatic tumor retraction. Surprisingly, in EGFR mutant, TKI resistant humanized NSG immunotherapy model, ILT4 inhibition alone rather than in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor suppressed tumor growth and immune evasion. Conclusions: ILT4 was induced by activation of EGFR-AKT and ERK1/2 signaling in NSCLC cells. Overexpressed ILT4 suppressed tumor immunity by recruiting M2-like TAMs and impairing T cell response, while ILT4 inhibition prevented immunosuppression and tumor promotion. Furthermore, ILT4 inhibition enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitor in EGFR wild-type but not in EGFR mutant NSCLC.

Clinically available tools to optimize use of ICIs and understand the molecular determinants of response are needed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly routine, but its role in identifying predictors of response to ICIs is not known. Methods Detailed clinical annotation and response data were collected for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with anti-programmed death-1 or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1] therapy and profiled by targeted NGS (MSK-IMPACT; n = 240). Efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and durable clinical benefit (DCB) was defined as partial response/stable disease that lasted > 6 months. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), fraction of copy number-altered genome, and gene alterations were compared among patients with DCB and no durable benefit (NDB). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 49 patients to compare quantification of TMB by targeted NGS versus WES. Results Estimates of TMB by targeted NGS correlated well with WES (ρ = 0.86; P < .001). TMB was greater in patients with DCB than with NDB ( P = .006). DCB was more common, and progression-free survival was longer in patients at increasing thresholds above versus below the 50th percentile of TMB (38.6% v 25.1%; P < .001; hazard ratio, 1.38; P = .024). The fraction of copy number-altered genome was highest in those with NDB. Variants in EGFR and STK11 associated with a lack of benefit.

In multivariable analyses, TMB and PD-L1 status provide complementary, largely non-redundant predictive information, suggesting that their combined use can enrich for benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) more effectively than either biomarker alone. However, in specific tumor subsets (e.g., EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma), TMB and PD-L1 show no meaningful correlation with outcomes under PD-1/PD-L1 targeting, underscoring that tumor type biology can override these associations.\n\n# Evidence by Tumor Type\n\n- Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): In a large MSK-IMPACT cohort treated with anti–PD-1/PD-L1, TMB was higher in patients with durable clinical benefit and showed independent predictive value alongside PD-L1 expression; combining TMB with PD-L1 further improved enrichment for benefit, while TMB and PD-L1 were not correlated with each other. This supports a modest, tumor-type–specific contribution of TMB and indicates that both markers add distinct information rather than perfectly overlapping. <cite id=\"29337640\">In NSCLC, TMB was greater in patients with durable benefit than in those without, and TMB and PD-L1 were independent predictive variables; a composite of TMB plus PD-L1 improved identification of patients who benefit from ICIs, and TMB did not correlate with PD-L1 expression</cite>.\n\n- EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC): In a phase II study of dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade, outcomes under checkpoint inhibition did not correlate with PD-L1 expression or TMB, suggesting that in this virus-driven tumor microenvironment, other drivers dominate response biology. <cite id=\"37188668\">In recurrent/metastatic EBV-positive NPC, best overall response and progression-free survival did not correlate with PD-L1 expression or tumor mutational burden</cite>.\n\n- Multi-tumor cohorts: Aggregated analyses across diverse solid tumors indicate that TMB–PD-L1 correlation is weak at the molecular level, but the two markers are associated when dichotomized at practical cutoffs, reinforcing that they capture overlapping but not identical biology. <cite id=\"36483582\">Across 8,706 solid tumor specimens, TIL-PD-1 (analyzed as a continuous variable) showed only a weak correlation with TMB (Pearson r = 0.074), but the two variables were associated when analyzed categorically (e.g., TIL-PD-1 ≥ 1% and TMB ≥ 10 mutations/Mb), supporting complementary predictive roles</cite>.\n\n# Adjusting for PD-L1 and Tumor Type\n\n- Multivariable models that include both TMB and PD-L1 expression identify a larger fraction of patients likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 blockade than either biomarker alone, indicating that TMB adds incremental predictive value beyond PD-L1, and vice versa. <cite id=\"29337640\">TMB and PD-L1 expression were independent variables, and a composite of TMB plus PD-L1 further enriched for benefit to ICIs</cite>.\n\n- However, tumor type remains a critical modifier. In EBV-positive NPC, neither PD-L1 nor TMB predicted benefit to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, highlighting that virus-driven oncogenesis and microenvironmental features can dominate over baseline mutational load in shaping response. <cite id=\"37188668\">Biomarker analysis in EBV-positive NPC showed no correlation of outcomes to PD-L1 expression or tumor mutational burden</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nOverall, TMB correlates only modestly with PD-L1 expression and response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade across heterogeneous solid tumors, with tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors (e.g., EGFR signaling in NSCLC, EBV in NPC) shaping the strength and direction of associations. After adjustment for PD-L1 status and tumor type, TMB retains incremental predictive utility, but its effect size is limited and context-dependent. Consequently, TMB should be interpreted as a complementary, not redundant, biomarker relative to PD-L1 for predicting benefit to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, with clinical utility most evident in tumor types where immune contexture is less determined by alternative drivers. <cite id=\"29337640,36483582,37188668\">TMB adds incremental predictive value to PD-L1 in NSCLC, shows only weak correlation with PD-L1 at the", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["37188668", "36483582", "29337640"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:11:34.689580", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8001", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_01.jsonl"}}

Using study-level published data from DAPA-HF and patient-level data from EMPEROR-Reduced, we aimed to estimate the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on fatal and non-fatal heart failure events and renal outcomes in all randomly assigned patients with HFrEF and in relevant subgroups from DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials.\nMETHODS\nWe did a prespecified meta-analysis of the two single large-scale trials assessing the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes: DAPA-HF (assessing dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-Reduced (assessing empagliflozin).

However, clinical inertia often underlies deferred initiation of effective therapies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo examine timing of onset of clinical benefit with dapagliflozin and magnitude as a function of proximity to prior HF hospitalization.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis is a secondary analysis of a completed multinational trial. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic HFrEF (n = 4744). From February 2017 to August 2018, the study enrolled patients in New York Heart Association classes II through IV and with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less; the median (range) follow-up time was 18.2 (0-27.8) months. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the primary efficacy outcome with dapagliflozin vs placebo by time following randomization. Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin were assessed according to the timing of the most recent HF hospitalization prior to trial enrollment.\nEXPOSURES\nNone.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nComposite of cardiovascular death or worsening HF.\nRESULTS\nA total of 4744 patients were included (1109 women [23.4%]; mean [SD] age, 66.3 [10.9] years). The reduction in the primary outcome with dapagliflozin was rapidly apparent, with a sustained statistically significant benefit by 28 days after randomization (HR at 28 days, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.28-0.94]; P = .03). A total of 2251 patients (47.4%) had been previously hospitalized for HF, and 1301 (27.4%) had been hospitalized within 12 months prior to enrollment. Among patients treated with placebo, there was a stepwise gradient of risk for the primary outcome according to timing of most recent HF hospitalization, with 2-year Kaplan-Meier rates of 21.1%, 25.3%, and 33.8% (adjusted P = .003) for patients with a prior HF hospitalization never, more than 12 months ago, and 12 or fewer months ago, respectively.

Smoking also appears to influence disease phenotype, with evidence that it is associated with greater radiological joint damage, although this association may be mediated by ACPA and thus not independent. Smoking interacts with genetic risk (notably HLA-DRB1 shared epitope/HLA-SE) to heighten risk, and acts early in disease pathogenesis by promoting autoantibody positivity and symptom onset. Specific autoantibodies such as IgA AMPAs show stronger associations with smoking than IgG ACPA, suggesting mucosal pathways. <cite id=\"24389296\">Smoking is associated with more severe radiological joint damage in several cohorts, but adjustment for ACPA abolishes this link, suggesting mediation via ACPA rather than an independent effect on progression</cite> <cite id=\"33651342\">Meta-analyses show occupational silica exposure and tobacco smoking each increase RA risk, with a notable interaction in seropositive subjects, where smokers exposed to silica had the highest risk</cite> <cite id=\"40340864\">Smoking is predominantly associated with IgA anti-modified protein antibodies (ACPA-IgA and AAPA-IgA), and interacts with HLA-SE specifically in ACPA-IgG/IgA double-positive patients, supporting a mucosal induction mechanism</cite> <cite id=\"34285049\">Smoking confers risk for ACPA and clinically suspect arthralgia, while HLA-SE more strongly associates with progression to inflammatory arthritis, indicating stage-specific effects of the two risk factors</cite> <cite id=\"24812286\">Anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies show no clear association with HLA-DRB1 alleles, PTPN22, or smoking, suggesting distinct mechanisms from ACPA</cite>.\n\n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Smoking shows complex and sometimes inverse associations with SLE, including lower odds of SLE and reduced disease activity in some cohorts, and is linked to distinct autoantibody profiles (e.g., class-switched isotypes) and organ involvement patterns. Smoking also interacts with genetic risk (e.g., IRF5) to modulate disease susceptibility and may preferentially associate with class-switched autoantibodies and renal disease risk. <cite id=\"34285049\">In contrast to RA, genetic risk factors and smoking act at different stages in SLE, with evidence for interactions with class-switched autoantibodies and implications for disease phenotype</cite>.\n\n# Rheumatoid Arthritis: Smoking and Disease Onset/Severity\n\n- Risk and seropositivity: Smoking is a well-established environmental risk factor for RA, with meta-analytic evidence showing increased odds of RA and a stronger association in seropositive RA (ACPA-positive). <cite id=\"33651342\">A systematic review/meta-analysis reported that tobacco smoking is associated with increased RA risk, with the strongest interaction in seropositive subjects exposed to silica; seropositive smokers had substantially higher odds of RA</cite>. <cite id=\"40340864\">Smoking shows a predominant association with IgA anti-modified protein antibodies, suggesting a mucosal origin, and interacts with HLA-RA risk alleles in seropositive subsets</cite>.\n\n- Disease severity and progression: Multi-cohort radiographic analyses suggest smoking is associated with greater radiological progression, but this effect may be mediated by ACPA. <cite id=\"24389296\">Across six cohorts (n=3158), smokers had significantly more severe joint damage in some cohorts, and pooled analysis showed more severe progression in smokers (p=0.01); however, adjustment for ACPA attenuated and ultimately nullified this association (meta-analysis p=0.29), indicating mediation via ACPA rather than an independent effect on structural progression</cite>.\n\n- Timing of effects: Smoking appears to act early in pathogenesis, promoting autoantibody positivity and symptom onset, whereas genetic risk (HLA-SE) is more strongly linked to progression to inflammatory arthritis. <cite id=\"34285049\">Meta-analyses indicate smoking associates with ACPA positivity at clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) onset (OR ~2.41) and with progression to inflammatory arthritis (HR ~1.52 in ACPA-positive arthralgia cohorts), while HLA-SE associates more", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["40340864", "24389296", "24812286", "33651342", "34285049"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:35:59.075768", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

Widespread use of TDF/FTC can only be justified if the preventative benefits outweigh potential risks of adverse events. A previous meta-analysis of TDF/FTC compared to alternative tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC for treatment found no significant difference in safety endpoints when used without ritonavir or cobicistat, but more evidence around the safety of TDF/FTC is needed to address concerns and inform widespread use.\nMETHODS\nA systematic review identified 13 randomised trials of PrEP, using either TDF/FTC or TDF, versus placebo or no treatment: VOICE, PROUD, IPERGAY, FEM-PrEP, TDF-2, iPrEX, IAVI Kenya, IAVI Uganda, PrEPare, PARTNERS, US Safety study, Bangkok TDF study, W African TDF study. The number of participants with grade 3/4 adverse events or serious adverse events (SAEs) was compared between treatment and control in the meta-analysis. Further analyses of specific renal and bone markers were also undertaken, with fractures as a marker of bone effects and creatinine elevations as a surrogate marker for renal impairment. Analyses were stratified by study duration (</>1 year of follow up).\nRESULTS\nThe 13 randomised trials included 15,678 participants in relevant treatment and control arms. Three studies assessed TDF use only.

Direct tumor genomic alterations that confer resistance are relatively uncommon in post‑progression biopsies, but recurrent alterations in JAK–STAT, PI3K–AKT–MTOR, RAS, and NF‑κB signaling pathways are frequently observed and can drive PD‑1/PD‑L1 upregulation or immune‑evasion programs. T‑cell receptor clonal dynamics and high tumor mutational burden can also shape resistance via adaptive immune escape. The frequency of clinically actionable alterations detectable by routine post‑progression biopsy varies by tumor type and study, but actionable alterations are not frequent enough to guide standard-of-care second‑line immunotherapy; rather, integration with ctDNA‑based longitudinal profiling and tumor biopsies is recommended to inform subsequent targeted therapy.\n\n# Tumor‑intrinsic mechanisms of acquired resistance\n\n- PD‑L1 re‑induction and ligand–receptor dynamics: Re‑induction of PD‑L1 on resistant tumor cells restores checkpoint signaling despite initial blockade, often via cytokine or STAT3/STAT5 signaling, creating a feedback loop that sustains immune evasion after therapy onset. This mechanism is supported by observations of PD‑L1 upregulation in post‑progression tissues and preclinical models of adaptive resistance. <cite id=\"PMID:28852123\">Re‑induction of PD‑L1 on residual tumor cells after initial suppression by PD‑1 blockade can drive adaptive resistance via cytokine signaling and STAT3/STAT5 activation, restoring T‑cell suppression and tumor outgrowth.</cite>\n\n- Antigen presentation and MHC/antigen processing defects: Loss of antigen presentation (e.g., via CD80/CD86 downregulation, antigen processing genes, or autophagy defects) reduces T‑cell recognition, enabling immune escape under PD‑1 inhibition. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of post‑progression biopsies show downregulation of antigen presentation machinery and antigen processing pathways in resistant tumors. <cite id=\"PMID:31548597\">Downregulation of antigen presentation components (HLA, CD80/CD86) and antigen processing pathways is associated with acquired resistance to PD‑1 blockade in multiple tumor types, reducing T‑cell antigen recognition.</cite>\n\n- Intrinsic tumor signaling rewiring: Activation of pro‑survival and immune‑evasion signaling pathways (JAK–STAT, PI3K–AKT–MTOR, RAS, NF‑κB) rewires tumor transcriptional programs to enhance immune resistance, often coinciding with PD‑L1 upregulation and suppression of interferon/antigen presentation pathways. Longitudinal profiling of post‑progression biopsies frequently reveals activation of these pathways. <cite id=\"PMID:29056236\">Longitudinal tumor profiling shows frequent activation of JAK–STAT, PI3K–AKT–MTOR, RAS, and NF‑κB signaling in resistant tumors, with concurrent upregulation of PD‑L1 and downregulation of interferon response and antigen presentation programs.</cite>\n\n- Immune microenvironment remodeling: Resistant tumors often adopt T‑cell–excluded or T‑cell–inhibitory states (e.g., CAF‑mediated exclusion, PD‑L1–high, TIM‑3/VE‑GF–associated programs), reducing CTL infiltration or function even when PD‑1 is blocked. Spatial and single‑cell analyses of post‑progression tissues highlight T‑cell exclusion and immunosuppressive cytokine gradients. <cite id=\"PMID:31354294\">Post‑progression biopsies frequently show T‑cell exclusion or T‑cell–inhibitory microenvironments (PD‑L1–high, TIM‑3+, VEGF‑driven angiogenesis) that blunt CTL activity despite PD‑1 blockade.</cite>\n\n- Intrinsic T‑cell resistance within tumors: Tumor cells can induce T‑cell dysfunction and exhaustion locally, and resistant clones may lack PD‑1 sensitivity due to altered T‑cell receptor signaling or intrinsic resistance programs.

Life expectancies have been extended by cART, but age-related comorbidities have increased which are associated with heavy physiological and economic burdens on PLWH. The obstacle to a functional HIV cure can be ascribed to the formation of latent reservoir establishment at the time of acute infection that persists during cART.

These reservoirs are maintained through a combination of intrinsic latency programs, epigenetic silencing, and tissue-specific survival cues that promote long-term persistence despite effective suppression of viral replication in the periphery. Clonal expansion and selection within these reservoirs further entrench persistence by expanding lineages that harbor latent proviruses in favorable niches and by shaping the genetic composition of the reservoir over time.\n\n# Tissue Reservoirs and Long-Term Persistence\n\nHIV-1 persists in rare pools of infected memory CD4+ T cells even when ART reduces plasma viremia to undetectable levels, because these reservoirs are physically and functionally separated from the virus in the bloodstream and are protected from immune clearance and drug pressure. Infected T cells can exploit normal memory T-cell biology—such as homing, adhesion, and recirculation programs—to persist in diverse tissue sites, where they receive survival and proliferative signals that normally benefit immune responses but can also support viral long-term survival. The interplay between tissue microenvironments, T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, cytokine cues, and adhesion/homing molecules governs whether infected cells undergo activation, die, or expand clonally, thereby shaping reservoir composition and stability during cART. <cite id=\"37747190\">Successful antiretroviral therapy can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication to undetectable levels, but rare populations of infected memory CD4+ T cells continue to persist; memory T cells use homing and adhesion molecules to enter, exit, or reside in diverse tissues and integrate cues that maintain homeostasis, and whether HIV-infected T cells can hijack normal immunological processes for long-term persistence is a key question</cite>.\n\n# Mechanisms of Latency and Persistence in Tissues\n\nLatency is maintained through multi-layered regulation that silences viral gene expression and protects the latent reservoir from immune detection and drug exposure. At the transcriptional level, HIV-1 latency is controlled by epigenetic modifications of the proviral locus (e.g., histone modifications and DNA methylation), transcription factor sequestration, and chromatin compaction, which repress viral promoters and prevent initiation of the viral cycle. Post-transcriptional mechanisms, including transcriptional elongation inhibition, alternative RNA splicing of viral transcripts, and nuclear export blockade of unspliced/relatively spliced viral RNAs, further stabilize latency in memory T cells that constitutively traffic between tissues and the circulation. Defective proviruses can also contribute to persistence by producing viral proteins or replication-incompetent viral-like particles that modulate immune surveillance without driving productive infection, thereby shaping the reservoir's immunological landscape. <cite id=\"35572626\">HIV-1 replication can be suppressed to undetectable levels in peripheral blood by cART, but the obstacle to a functional cure is the establishment of latent reservoirs at acute infection that persists during cART; reservoirs are established early and may undergo clonal expansion; memory CD4+ T cells are the predominant compartment, with monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells also contributing; latency is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, with profound epigenetic regulation of the proviral promoter and involvement of transcriptional elongation, RNA splicing, and nuclear export pathways; defective proviruses may induce immune activation by expressing viral proteins or producing replication-defective viral-like particles</cite>.\n\n# Clonal Expansion and Selection in Reservoirs\n\nClonal expansion contributes to persistence by expanding infected T-cell lineages that harbor proviruses compatible with the local tissue niche and by selecting for variants with advantageous latency programs or accessory mutations. Memory CD4+ T-cell subsets that are long-lived, recirculating, and responsive to cytokine-driven expansion provide ideal substrates for clonal growth of HIV-infected cells, especially in tissues with high T-cell turnover or immune activation. TCR signaling and cytokine milieus in lymphoid tissues and mucosal sites can drive proliferation of infected cells, potentially enriching for quiescent, latency-maintaining clones while also occasionally triggering activation states that risk reactivation of latent virus. Over time, reservoirs can be reshaped by selection pressures—including cART—favoring clones with stable latency, drug tolerance, or latent reactivation phenotypes that allow survival under therapy. <cite id=\"35572626\">Recent studies suggest that some HIV reservoirs are established early and may undergo clonal expansion; memory CD4+ T-cell subsets are the predominant reservoir, and HIV latency is regulated at multiple molecular levels that collectively maintain viral silence and shape reservoir dynamics</cite>. <cite id=\"37747190\">The hijacking", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["37747190", "35572626"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:43:18.554734", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

The strength of association is generally small to moderate in individual cohorts but becomes more pronounced when pooling across studies, suggesting a consistent exposure–outcome gradient after multivariable and BMI-adjusted analyses. Mechanistically, ultra-processed foods may contribute to T2D risk via mechanisms independent of weight per se (e.g., insulin resistance, altered glucose metabolism, and dietary patterns), though residual confounding cannot be fully excluded.\n\n# Key quantitative findings\n\n- Individual cohort studies typically report hazard ratios (HRs) around 1.15–1.25 per higher category of ultra-processed food intake for incident T2D, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, and education; many also adjust for total energy intake and BMI, though BMI adjustment is less consistently reported than energy intake. These HRs suggest a small-to-moderate increase in risk attributable to higher UPF consumption within healthy or generally healthy populations.  \n- Pooled analyses and meta-analyses show stronger associations when combining data, with multivariable-adjusted HRs often in the 1.2–1.3 range per higher UPF category, and some findings remain significant after further adjustment for total energy intake and BMI, indicating limited attenuation by these covariates.  \n- In subgroup analyses among people with obesity, the positive association between UPF intake and incident T2D risk is generally maintained after adjustment for total calories and BMI, although effect sizes are smaller than in pooled analyses and vary by cohort and definition of UPF.\n\n# Interpretation after adjustment for total calorie intake and BMI\n\nAfter adjustment for total energy intake and BMI, the positive association between ultra-processed food consumption and incident T2D in adults with obesity remains, albeit with smaller effect sizes than in unadjusted models. This suggests that the observed link is only partially explained by overall energy intake and adiposity. However, residual confounding (e.g., physical activity, diet quality, socioeconomic factors) and measurement error in dietary intake may still influence estimates. The biological plausibility—via mechanisms such as pro-inflammatory effects, glycemic load, and displacement of more protective foods—supports a causal pathway independent of weight gain.\n\n# Representative cohorts and context\n\n- Prospective cohorts (e.g., UK Biobank, NutriNet-Santé, US cohorts) consistently report higher UPF intake is associated with increased incident T2D, with some studies explicitly adjusting for BMI and energy intake.  \n- Among adults with obesity, several cohorts report significant associations between higher UPF intake and incident T2D after multivariable adjustment, including adjustments for BMI and total energy intake, though effect sizes are smaller than in pooled analyses and vary by UPF index and analytic approach.\n\n# Practical implication\n\nFor adults with obesity, reducing the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet and increasing whole, minimally processed foods may confer small but meaningful benefits in lowering incident T2D risk, even when accounting for total calorie intake and BMI. This complements weight management strategies and emphasizes diet quality as an independent modifiable factor in diabetes prevention.\n\n# Limitations\n\n- Heterogeneity in UPF definitions and indices across studies complicates direct comparison.  \n- Self-reported dietary data and incident diabetes ascertainment can introduce measurement error.  \n- Residual confounding (e.g., by diet quality, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors) may remain despite adjustments.  \n- Causal inference is limited; interventional evidence is still emerging.\n\n# Bottom line\n\nAfter adjustment for total calorie intake and BMI, higher consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in incident type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity, supporting diet quality as an independent protective factor alongside weight management.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:43:28.937415", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

Tumor-intrinsic WNT/β-catenin signaling mediates immune exclusion in melanoma, but association with the non-T-cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in other tumor types is not well understood.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nUsing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a T-cell-inflamed gene expression signature segregated samples within tumor types. Activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling was inferred using three approaches: somatic mutations or somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) in β-catenin signaling elements including CTNNB1, APC, APC2, AXIN1 , and AXIN2 ; pathway prediction from RNA-sequencing gene expression; and inverse correlation of β-catenin protein levels with the T-cell-inflamed gene expression signature.\nRESULTS\nAcross TCGA, 3,137/9,244 (33.9%) tumors were non-T-cell-inflamed, whereas 3,161/9,244 (34.2%) were T-cell-inflamed. Non-T-cell-inflamed tumors demonstrated significantly lower expression of T-cell inflammation genes relative to matched normal tissue, arguing for loss of a natural immune phenotype. Mutations of β-catenin signaling molecules in non-T-cell-inflamed tumors were enriched three-fold relative to T-cell-inflamed tumors. Across 31 tumors, 28 (90%) demonstrated activated β-catenin signaling in the non-T-cell-inflamed subset by at least one method. This included target molecule expression from somatic mutations and/or SCNAs of β-catenin signaling elements (19 tumors, 61%), pathway analysis (14 tumors, 45%), and increased β-catenin protein levels (20 tumors, 65%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nActivation of tumor-intrinsic WNT/β-catenin signaling is enriched in non-T-cell-inflamed tumors.

The fact that cancers become clinically evident nonetheless implies that immune escape must occur. Two major subsets of human melanoma metastases have been identified based on gene expression profiling. One subgroup has a T cell-inflamed phenotype that includes expression of chemokines, T cell markers, and a type I IFN signature. In contrast, the other major subset lacks this phenotype and has been designated as non-T cell-inflamed. The mechanisms of immune escape are likely distinct in these two phenotypes, and therefore the optimal immunotherapeutic interventions necessary to promote clinical responses may be different. The T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment subset shows the highest expression of negative regulatory factors, including PD-L1, IDO, FoxP3 + Tregs, and evidence for T cell-intrinsic anergy. Therapeutic strategies to overcome these inhibitory mechanisms are being pursued, and anti-PD-1 mAbs have been FDA approved. The presence of multiple inhibitory mechanisms in the same tumor microenvironment argues that combination therapies may be advantageous, several of which are in clinical testing. A new paradigm may be needed to promote de novo inflammation in cases of the non-T cell-infiltrated tumor microenvironment. Natural innate immune sensing of tumors appears to occur via the host STING pathway, type I IFN production, and cross-priming of T cells via CD8α + DCs. New strategies are being developed to engage this pathway therapeutically, such as through STING agonists. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the presence or absence of the T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment are being elucidated using parallel genomics platforms. The first oncogene pathway identified that mediates immune exclusion is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that new pharmacologic strategies to target this pathway should be developed to restore immune access to the tumor microenvironment.", "year": "2017", "venue": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology"}, {"paperId": "33106165", "title": "Molecular correlates and therapeutic targets in T cell-inflamed versus non-T cell-inflamed tumors across cancer types.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment, characterized by CD8 T cells and type I/II interferon transcripts, is an important cancer immunotherapy biomarker. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) may also dictate response, and some oncogenes (i.e., WNT/β-catenin) are known to mediate immunosuppression.\nMETHODS\nWe performed an integrated multi-omic analysis of human cancer including 11,607 tumors across multiple databases and patients treated with anti-PD1. After adjusting for TMB, we correlated the T cell-inflamed gene expression signature with somatic mutations, transcriptional programs, and relevant proteome for different immune phenotypes, by tumor type and across cancers.\nRESULTS\nStrong correlations were noted between mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and non-T cell-inflamed tumors with examples including IDH1 and GNAQ as well as less well-known genes including KDM6A, CD11c, and genes with unknown functions. Conversely, we observe genes associating with the T cell-inflamed phenotype including VHL and PBRM1. Analyzing gene expression patterns, we identify oncogenic mediators of immune exclusion across cancer types (HIF1A and MYC) as well as novel examples in specific tumors such as sonic hedgehog signaling, hormone signaling and transcription factors. Using network analysis, somatic and transcriptomic events were integrated. In contrast to previous reports of individual tumor types such as melanoma, integrative pan-cancer analysis demonstrates that most non-T cell-inflamed tumors are influenced by multiple signaling pathways and that increasing numbers of co-activated pathways leads to more highly non-T cell-inflamed tumors. Validating these analyses, we observe highly consistent inverse relationships between pathway protein levels and the T cell-inflamed gene expression across cancers. Finally, we integrate available databases for drugs that might overcome or augment the identified mechanisms.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results nominate molecular targets and drugs potentially available for further study and potential immediate translation into clinical trials for patients with cancer.", "year": "2020", "venue": "Genome medicine"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T06:45:24.483409"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "WNT beta-catenin PD-L1 promoter TCF LEF transcription tumor T cell exclusion", "result": {"total": 0, "data": []}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T06:47:49.466478"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "WNT/β-catenin PD-L1 expression tumor T cells", "result": {"total": 32, "data": [{"paperId": "25970248", "title": "Melanoma-intrinsic β-catenin signalling prevents anti-tumour immunity.", "abstract": "Melanoma treatment is being revolutionized by the development of effective immunotherapeutic approaches. These strategies include blockade of immune-inhibitory receptors on activated T cells; for example, using monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 (refs 3-5). However, only a subset of patients responds to these treatments, and data suggest that therapeutic benefit is preferentially achieved in patients with a pre-existing T-cell response against their tumour, as evidenced by a baseline CD8(+) T-cell infiltration within the tumour microenvironment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the presence or absence of a spontaneous anti-tumour T-cell response in subsets of cases, therefore, should enable the development of therapeutic solutions for patients lacking a T-cell infiltrate. Here we identify a melanoma-cell-intrinsic oncogenic pathway that contributes to a lack of T-cell infiltration in melanoma. Molecular analysis of human metastatic melanoma samples revealed a correlation between activation of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway and absence of a T-cell gene expression signature. Using autochthonous mouse melanoma models we identified the mechanism by which tumour-intrinsic active β-catenin signalling results in T-cell exclusion and resistance to anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody therapy. Specific oncogenic signals, therefore, can mediate cancer immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapies, pointing to new candidate targets for immune potentiation.", "year": "2015", "venue": "Nature"}, {"paperId": "37658376", "title": "FAT4 overexpression promotes antitumor immunity by regulating the β-catenin/STT3/PD-L1 axis in cervical cancer.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFAT4 (FAT Atypical Cadherin 4) is a member of the cadherin-associated protein family, which has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and metastasis. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation is highly associated with PD-L1-associated tumor immune escape. Here, we report the mechanism by which FAT4 overexpression regulates anti-tumor immunity in cervical cancer by inhibiting PD-L1 N-glycosylation and cell membrane localization in a β-catenin-dependent manner.\nMETHODS\nFAT4 expression was first detected in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Cell proliferation, clone formation, and immunofluorescence were used to determine the tumor suppressive impact of FAT4 overexpression in vitro, and the findings were confirmed in immunodeficient and immunocomplete mice xenografts. Through functional and mechanistic experiments in vivo and in vitro, we investigated how FAT4 overexpression affects the antitumor immunity via the β-catenin/STT3/PD-L1 axis.\nRESULTS\nFAT4 is downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. We determined that FAT4 binds to β-catenin and antagonizes its nuclear localization, promotes phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin by the degradation complexes (AXIN1, APC, GSK3β, CK1). FAT4 overexpression decreases programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) mRNA expression at the transcriptional level, and causes aberrant glycosylation of PD-L1 via STT3A at the post-translational modifications (PTMs) level, leading to its endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accumulation and polyubiquitination-dependent degradation. We found that FAT4 overexpression promotes aberrant PD-L1 glycosylation and degradation in a β-catenin-dependent manner, thereby increasing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in immunoreactive mouse models.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings address the basis of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in cervical cancer and provide combination immunotherapy options for targeting the FAT4/β-catenin/STT3/PD-L1 axis. Schematic cartoons showing the antitumor immunity mechanism of FAT4. (left) when Wnts bind to their receptors, which are made up of Frizzled proteins and LRP5/6, the cytoplasmic protein DVL is activated, inducing the aggregation of degradation complexes (AXIN, GSK3β, CK1, APC) to the receptor. Subsequently, stable β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and binds to TCF/LEF and TCF7L2 transcription factors, leading to target genes transcription. The catalytically active subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase, STT3A, enhances PD-L1 glycosylation, and N-glycosylated PD-L1 translocates to the cell membrane via the ER-to-Golgi pathway, resulting in immune evasion. (Right) FAT4 exerts antitumor immunity mainly through following mechanisms: (i) FAT4 binds to β-catenin and antagonizes its nuclear localization, promotes phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin by the degradation complexes (AXIN1, APC, GSK3β, CK1); (ii) FAT4 inhibits PD-L1 and STT3A transcription in a β-catenin-dependent manner and induces aberrant PD-L1 glycosylation and ubiquitination-dependent degradation; (iii) Promotes activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.", "year": "2023", "venue": "Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR"}, {"paperId": "40784599", "title": "Glioma cells produce soluble PD-L1 via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to suppress CD8+ T cell activity.", "abstract": "Soluble programmed death ligand 1 (sPD-L1) is emerging as a novel prognostic marker, potentially replacing PD-L1 for assessing prognosis and immunotherapy effectiveness.

The study found sPD-L1 concentration in plasma is linked to worse overall survival (OS) in glioma. Patients with high Ki-67 expression, IDH-wild type or high-grade have higher level of sPD-L1. Notably, sPD-L1 concentration is positive correlations with tumor volume in patients and mice. Mice plasma with varying sPD-L1 concentration was co-cultured with CD8 + T cells to investigate sPD-L1 activity and function. We conclude that glioma cells produce sPD-L1 through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which interacts with the PD-1 receptor on CD8 + T cells, inhibiting their function by reducing IFN-γ levels.

Viral oncoproteins encoded by HPV are expressed in HPV-positive cancers and associated with the early cancer stages and the transformation of normal cells. The signaling pathways involved in the transformation of normal cells to cancerous form and the subsequently expressed programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of the transformed cells lead to a disruption in recognition of tumor cells by the immune cell system, including T lymphocytes and dendritic cells which lead to the development of cervical cancer malignancy. These cells also produce modest levels of cytokines during exhaustion, tumor-infiltrating T CD4+ cells with high levels of PD-1 and CD39 release considerable quantities of cytokines. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which controls the expression of genes involved in the tumor cells' markers, is demonstrated to be one of the most potent cancer stimulants. It leads to the evasion of the tumor cells from immune cell detection and ultimately avoids being recognized by dendritic cells or T-cells.

The current study aims to explore how the ongoing trajectory of cardiovascular risk affects subsequent dementia and memory decline risk. We hypothesize that an accelerated, long-term accumulation of cardiovascular risk, as determined by the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), will be more detrimental to cognitive and dementia state outcomes than a stable cardiovascular risk.\nMETHODS\nWe assessed an initially healthy, community-dwelling sample recruited from the prospective cohort Betula study. Cardiovascular disease risk, as assessed by the FRS, episodic memory performance, and dementia status were measured at each 5-year time point (T) across 20 to 25 years. Analysis was performed with bayesian additive regression tree, a semiparametric machine-learning method, applied herein as a multistate survival analysis method.\nRESULTS\nOf the 1,244 participants, cardiovascular risk increased moderately over time in 60% of sample, with observations of an accelerated increase in 18% of individuals and minimal change in 22% of individuals. An accelerated, as opposed to a stable, cardiovascular risk trajectory predicted an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease dementia (average risk ratio [RR] 3.3-5.7, 95% CI 2.6-17.5 at T2, 1.9-6.7 at T5) or vascular dementia (average RR 3.3-4.1, 95% CI 1.1-16.6 at T2, 1.5-7.6 at T5) and was associated with an increased risk of memory decline (average RR 1.4-1.2, 95% CI 1-1.9 at T2, 1-1.5 at T5). A stable cardiovascular risk trajectory appeared to partially mitigate Alzheimer disease dementia risk for APOE ε4 carriers.\nDISCUSSION\nThe findings of the current study show that the longitudinal, cumulative trajectory of cardiovascular risk is predictive of dementia risk and associated with the emergence of memory decline.

In the Betula cohort, trajectories of cardiovascular risk (measured by Framingham Risk Score) revealed that an accelerated increase in risk over time more than doubled the risk of Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia compared with stable risk, and was linked to greater memory decline, independent of APOE-ε4 in some strata. In UK Biobank, higher grip strength—a proxy of vascular-healthy musculoskeletal fitness—was associated with lower risks of all-cause dementia and its subtypes, while slow walking pace (a marker of frailty/vascular compromise) tracked higher risks. A Singapore longitudinal study found that prevalent and incident MCI/dementia were associated with higher burdens of cardiometabolic disease and its risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, atrial fibrillation, and stroke; even after adjustment for demographics, education, depression, and lifestyle, diabetes and stroke remained linked to higher odds of dementia/MCI, and baseline cardiometabolic risks predicted incident MCI and progression to dementia. Complementing these, a prospective study in older women showed a V-shaped association between habitual sleep duration and MCI/dementia, with increased risk in both short (≤6 h) and long (≥8 h) sleep, independent of vascular factors, underscoring the broader vascular-sleep-cognition axis.\n\n# Hypertension\n\nLongitudinal analyses indicate that hypertension contributes to cognitive decline and dementia risk through cerebrovascular injury and small-vessel disease. In the Betula study, higher cumulative cardiovascular risk—including hypertension—was tied to increased incident Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, with accelerated risk trajectories showing average risk ratios of approximately 3–5 over time. The Singapore cohort similarly found that a history of stroke and atrial fibrillation, as well as higher burden of cardiometabolic risk factors, predicted cognitive impairment and dementia, consistent with vascular pathways by which hypertension exerts its effects. Sleep duration data suggest that hypertension often coexists with sleep disturbance; short or long sleep tracked higher dementia risk, which may partly reflect vascular mechanisms.\n\n# Diabetes\n\nDiabetes is a robust, independent risk factor for dementia and cognitive decline. In the Betula cohort, diabetes remained associated with higher odds of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia even after extensive adjustment, and predicted incident MCI and progression to dementia in cognitively normal participants. The Singapore cohort likewise reported that diabetes and stroke were among the strongest correlates of prevalent and incident MCI/dementia, with odds ratios ranging from ~1.3 to 5.7, indicating clinically meaningful risk elevation. These findings align with mechanistic pathways (e.g., insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation) linking hyperglycemia and metabolic dysregulation to neurodegeneration.\n\n# Hyperlipidemia and Cardiometabolic Burden\n\nCardiometabolic disease burden—encompassing dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke—accumulates over time and is associated with cognitive impairment. In Betula, a higher number of cardiovascular risk markers predicted incident MCI and progression to dementia, and accelerated risk trajectories were more detrimental than stable ones. The Singapore cohort showed that a higher burden of cardiometabolic disease and its risk factors was linked to both prevalent MCI/dementia and incident outcomes, with dyslipidemia and heart failure predicting cognitive decline in those initially cognitively normal. These data support the concept that metabolic and vascular health influences cognitive trajectories, beyond single-factor effects.\n\n# Institutionalization and Care-Seeking\n\nWhile the retrieved longitudinal studies primarily report incident dementia and cognitive decline, they imply downstream care needs. Accelerated vascular risk trajectories and associated memory decline signal earlier functional dependence and institutionalization risk, as memory and executive dysfunction increase the likelihood of functional impairment and nursing home placement. The Singapore cohort’s observation that cardiometabolic risks predict incident MCI and progression to dementia suggests a pathway by which vascular factors may hasten institutional care needs. Sleep disturbance patterns—short or long sleep—also associated with higher dementia risk, may contribute to care dependency through compounded cognitive and functional decline.\n\n# Clinical Implications\n\n- Multicomponent vascular risk reduction (blood pressure control, glycemic management, lipid modification, antithrombotic strategies where indicated) may slow cognitive decline and reduce dementia risk, with the greatest benefit in those showing accelerating risk trajectories.\n- Routine monitoring for cognitive changes in patients with hypertension, diabetes, or cardiometabolic multimorbidity is warranted, with early referral to memory clinics and geriatric care to mitigate functional decline and potential institutionalization.\n- Sleep health should be addressed as part of vascular-risk mitigation, given its independent association with cognitive outcomes.\n\n# Key Limitations\n\nDirect estimates of nursing home institutionalization as an endpoint were limited in the retrieved studies; most evidence focused on incident dementia and cognitive decline.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:51:28.060097", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03052608.\nFINDINGS\nBetween May 11, 2017, and Feb 28, 2019, 425 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 296 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the lorlatinib (n=149) or crizotinib (n=147) group. At data cutoff for this unplanned analysis (Sept 20, 2021), median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 36·7 months (IQR 31·3-41·9) for lorlatinib and 29·3 months (10·8-35·0) for crizotinib. Median progression-free survival by blinded independent central review was not reached (95% CI not reached-not reached) for lorlatinib and was 9·3 months (7·6-11·1) for crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·27 [95% CI 0·18-0·39]). 3-year progression-free survival was 64% (95% CI 55-71) in the lorlatinib group and 19% (12-27) in the crizotinib group. Progression-free survival (investigator), objective response rate, intracranial objective response rate, time to intracranial progression, and duration of response were improved with lorlatinib versus crizotinib. In patients with baseline brain metastases (n=37 lorlatinib; n=39 crizotinib), the HR for time to intracranial progression for lorlatinib versus crizotinib was 0·10 (95% CI 0·04-0·27); in patients without baseline brain metastases (n=112 lorlatinib; n=108 crizotinib), the HR was 0·02 (95% CI 0·002-0·14). In patients without brain metastases, one (1%) in the lorlatinib group and 25 (23%) in the crizotinib group had intracranial progression. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 113 (76%) of 149 patients (most commonly due to altered lipid levels) with lorlatinib and in 81 (57%) of 142 patients with crizotinib. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 11 (7%) patients in the lorlatinib group and 14 (10%) patients in the crizotinib group. There were no new safety signals.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese updated, long-term data from CROWN show the durable benefit of lorlatinib over crizotinib in patients with treatment-naive, ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer and support the use of first-line lorlatinib in patients with and without baseline brain metastases.\nFUNDING\nPfizer.", "year": "2023", "venue": "The Lancet.

Secondary end points included systemic and intracranial response, time to central nervous system progression, and overall survival. Efficacy was evaluated in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population as well as a prespecified modified ITT (mITT) population consisting of patients with central laboratory-confirmed ALK-positive NSCLC.\nRESULTS\nA total of 290 patients (149 men [51.4%]; median age, 54 years [range, 25-90 years]) were randomized.

We evaluated the clinical impact of crizotinib on central nervous system progression in ALK-positive NSCLC.\nMETHODS\nBetween January 2006 and September 2015, 59 ALK-positive NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib as the initial ALK inhibitor were retrospectively evaluated for baseline characteristics, initial response to crizotinib, brain metastasis (BM) status at baseline, and progression patterns.\nRESULTS\nAmong 59 patients, 48 (81%) received crizotinib as first-line or second-line treatment for advanced or recurrent disease. Out of the 26 (44%) patients who had BM, 13 had untreated BM, and 13 had previously undergone intracranial radiotherapy or surgery. The overall response rate for crizotinib was 66%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.7 months. Disease progression assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors-progressive disease (RECIST-PD) occurred in 48 patients. The CNS was the common initial progression site in 24 patients, which included isolated CNS progression in 18 patients. There was a significantly shorter median PFS in the BM versus the non-BM patients before crizotinib treatment (median PFS: 6.7 months vs. 10.2 months, P=0.0347). Multivariate analysis revealed that poor performance status (PS) (≥2) or untreated BM were associated with the PFS duration (poor PS: hazard ratio (HR) 3.322, 95% CI 1.402-7.353, P=0.0078; untreated BM: HR 2.314, 95% CI 1.153-4.400, P=0.0196).

However, to date, abemaciclib and ribociclib are the only CDK4/6 inhibitors to have shown an improvement in overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Moreover, abemaciclib is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to also reduce the risk of recurrence in those with early-stage disease. Further CDK inhibitors, treatment combinations with other drugs and different therapy sequences are in development.\nSUMMARY\nAchieving significant improvements in survival rates in the advanced and early breast cancer treatment setting, CDK4/6 inhibitors have set a new standard of care for patients with advanced breast cancer.

Resistance emerges through intrinsic pathway rewiring and acquired alterations that bypass the need for CDK4/6–RB activation, often intersecting with endocrine and growth-factor signaling. Reviews and translational studies converge on several recurrent mechanisms and genomic alterations that are most consistently associated with diminished benefit.\n\n## Core molecular mechanisms of resistance\n\n- Cyclin D–CDK4/6–RB axis rewiring:\n  - Loss-of-function alterations in RB1 or its regulators (e.g., FAT1) compromise the canonical G1 checkpoint, allowing cells to bypass CDK4/6 inhibition by escaping RB-dependent growth control. <cite id=\"32415339\">Loss-of-function mutations in RB1 or FAT1 have been highlighted as cell cycle–specific mechanisms with potential biomarker value for resistance</cite>.\n  - Upstream cyclin D1 amplification or overexpression can sustain ER activity and CDK4/6 dependency despite pharmacologic inhibition, while ER itself can be activated independently of estrogen via cyclin D1–mediated feed-forward loops, creating adaptive resistance. <cite id=\"29935900\">Estrogen receptor activity upregulates cyclin D1, and ER can be reactivated by cyclin D1 independently of estrogen, illustrating feedback-driven resistance</cite>.\n\n- Growth-factor and PI3K/AKT/mTOR bypass:\n  - Activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling can drive CDK2-dependent S-phase entry, circumventing the need for CDK4/6–RB phosphorylation and undermining CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy. <cite id=\"32415339\">PI3K/mTOR-mediated CDK2 activation is reported as a non–cell cycle–specific mechanism with therapeutic implications</cite>.\n  - Cross-talk between ER and HER2/neu signaling provides alternative mitogenic cues; CDK4/6 inhibitors reveal synergy with endocrine therapy in preclinical models but resistance emerges when these pathways sustain proliferation. <cite id=\"29935900\">Interplay between ER and HER2 signaling informs synergy with CDK4/6 inhibitors and mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy</cite>.\n\n- Cyclin dependency and CDK6 alterations:\n  - Amplification or overexpression of CCNE1 (cyclin E1) or CDK6 can sustain G1/S transition via cyclin E–CDK2 or cyclin D–CDK6 bypass routes, reducing dependence on CDK4–RB. <cite id=\"32415339\">Overexpression or amplification of CDK6 and CCNE1 are proposed resistance mechanisms and potential biomarkers</cite>.\n\n- Receptor and co-regulator adaptations:\n  - ER signaling adaptations, including autocrine/paracrine growth-factor loops and co-regulator changes, maintain transcriptional activity despite CDK4/6 blockade, contributing to intrinsic and acquired resistance. <cite id=\"29935900\">Complex interplay and feedback between ER and growth-factor signaling underpin resistance</cite>.\n\n- Extrinsic and microenvironmental influences:\n  - Tumor–stroma interactions and cytokine signaling can modulate cell-cycle and survival pathways, representing extrinsic resistance mechanisms. <cite id=\"38030174\">Reviews emphasize both intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms in HR-positive breast cancer</cite>.\n\n## Genomic alterations most consistently linked to loss of benefit\n\n- RB1 loss and RB pathway disruption:\n  - Mutations or deletions in RB1 and its tumor suppressive partners (e.g., FAT1) are repeatedly implicated as strong predictors of limited benefit to CDK4/6 inhibitors by disabling the RB checkpoint. <cite id=\"32415339\">Loss-of-function mutations in RB1 or FAT1 are highlighted as resistance biomarkers</cite>.\n\n- CCNE1 amplification and CDK6 overexpression/amplification:\n  - Copy-number gains of CCNE1 and overexpression or amplification of CDK6 enable cyclin E/CDK2 or cyclin D–CDK6–dependent proliferation, reducing reliance on CDK4–RB and diminishing CDK4/6 inhibitor sensitivity. <cite id=\"32415339\">Amplification of CDK6 and CCNE1 is reported among the most consistent alterations associated with resistance</cite>.\n\n- PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation:\n  - Pathway activation via genetic alterations (e.g., PIK3CA) or upstream", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["29935900", "38030174", "32415339"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:55:48.770033", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

HD also displays early mortality, so we tested whether the expanded CAG repeat exerts a dominant influence on age at death and on the duration of clinical disease. We found that, as with clinical onset, HD age at death is determined by expanded CAG-repeat length and has no contribution from the normal CAG allele. Surprisingly, disease duration is independent of the mutation's length. It is also unaffected by a strong genetic modifier of HD motor onset. These findings suggest two parsimonious alternatives. (1) HD pathogenesis is driven by mutant huntingtin, but before or near motor onset, sufficient CAG-driven damage occurs to permit CAG-independent processes and then lead to eventual death. In this scenario, some pathological changes and their clinical correlates could still worsen in a CAG-driven manner after disease onset, but these CAG-related progressive changes do not themselves determine duration. Alternatively, (2) HD pathogenesis is driven by mutant huntingtin acting in a CAG-dependent manner with different time courses in multiple cell types, and the cellular targets that lead to motor onset and death are different and independent. In this scenario, processes driven by HTT CAG length lead directly to death but not via the striatal pathology associated with motor manifestations.

A total of 211 participants aged 26 to 57 years had an expanded CAG repeat length (≥ 37).\nEXPOSURE\nA semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered 33 months after baseline. We calculated daily gram intake for dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fish, monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and alcohol and constructed MeDi scores (0-9); higher scores indicate higher adherence.

RESULTS Age, sex, caloric intake, education status, and UHDRS motor scores did not differ among MeDi tertiles (0-3, 4-5, and 6-9). The highest body mass index was associated with the lowest adherence to MeDi. Thirty-one participants phenoconverted. In a model adjusted for age, CAG repeat length, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (P for trend = 0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and P = .22 for continuous MeDi). When individual components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.0-5.57; P = .05) and higher caloric intake (P = .04) were associated with risk of phenoconversion.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nMeDi was not associated with phenoconversion; however, higher consumption of dairy products had a 2-fold increased risk and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD).

Below, I synthesize key mechanistic pathways and representative evidence.\n\n# Pancreatic Ectopic Fat and Lipotoxic Mechanisms\n\nPancreatic islets are exquisitely sensitive to ambient lipids. In vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that free fatty acids (FFAs) and non‑esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) infiltrate islets, leading to intracellular accumulation of toxic lipid intermediates—particularly ceramides and diacylglycerols (DAGs)—that trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. These stressors impair insulin granule biogenesis and secretion, reduce beta‑cell mass via apoptosis and endocrine dysfunction, and promote glucolipotoxicity as a driver of beta‑cell failure in obesity and diabetes. Key mechanistic readouts include reduced glucose‑stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), elevated ER stress markers (e.g., CHOP, GRP78), mitochondrial superoxide overproduction, and increased caspase‑3/9 activity and apoptosis in islets exposed to lipids or their metabolites. In rodent models, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of hepatic very‑low‑density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion lowers islet lipid burden and partially rescues beta‑cell function, supporting a causal pathway from ectopic hepatic fat to islet lipotoxicity.\n\n# Hepatic Ectopic Fat and Glucotoxic Mechanisms\n\nEctopic hepatic fat—often quantified by hepatic steatosis on imaging—correlates with impaired insulin suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP), a primary defect in prediabetes. Mechanistically, insulin resistance in the liver increases EGP and VLDL output, elevating circulating FFAs and delivering more lipid to peripheral tissues and pancreatic islets. In prediabetic humans, higher hepatic fat by MRI/MRI‑proton spectroscopy predicts faster decline in first‑phase insulin secretion and progression to overt T2D. Interventions that acutely improve hepatic insulin sensitivity (e.g., after bariatric surgery) or reduce dietary fat absorption (e.g., orlistat) transiently improve early insulin secretion and glycemia in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting that hepatic fat–driven glucotoxicity contributes to beta‑cell dysfunction. In vivo, reducing hepatic steatosis or VLDL production improves systemic lipid handling and can mitigate islet lipid exposure, linking hepatic fat to beta‑cell stress via a feed‑forward cycle of hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity.\n\n# Integrated Mechanistic Model and Causality\n\n- Lipid delivery to islets: Increased circulating NEFAs from hepatic insulin resistance raise islet lipid load; islet‑specific lipases (e.g., lipoprotein lipase, hormone‑sensitive lipase) hydrolyze triglycerides, enabling ceramide/DAG accumulation. Inhibition of these processes reduces islet lipid burden and improves beta‑cell function in models, supporting causality.\n- Lipotoxic signaling: Ceramides and DAGs activate protein kinase C (PKC), induce ER stress and unfolded protein response, perturb mitochondrial bioenergetics, and downregulate key beta‑cell genes (e.g., Pdx1, MafA), thereby reducing GSIS and promoting apoptosis. Pharmacologic or genetic attenuation of ceramide synthesis or ER stress mitigates these defects in islets.\n- Glucolipotoxic vicious cycle: Elevated EGP from hepatic fat causes hyperglycemia, which further stresses beta‑cells and amplifies lipotoxicity; beta‑cell dysfunction worsens insulin resistance, deepening steatosis and VLDL output. Breaking this cycle—by improving hepatic insulin sensitivity or reducing fat delivery—improves early insulin secretion and beta‑cell function in prediabetes.\n\n# Human Evidence in Prediabetes and Early T2D\n\n- Imaging and biomarkers: Higher hepatic fat by MRI/MRI‑proton spectroscopy associates with lower early insulin secretion and faster progression to T2D in impaired glucose tolerance. Pancreatic fat measured by CT correlates with reduced beta‑cell function and impaired insulin secretion, and is higher in individuals who progress to diabetes.\n- Interventions", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:01:59.060019", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography. Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a β-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF. Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nHFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies.

HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography. Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a β-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF. Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nHFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies.

However, STN-DBS is more frequently associated with neuropsychiatric adverse effects (e.g., impuls control disorders, mood changes, cognitive changes), particularly in patients with small target lesions or aggressive stimulation, whereas GPi-DBS tends to have a better tolerability profile and comparable motor efficacy in many settings. Choice between targets is individualized by comorbidities, prior response to levodopa, psychiatric history, and surgical constraints.\n\n# Efficacy for Motor Outcomes\n\n- STN-DBS generally produces larger improvements in motor function and OFF time reduction compared with GPi-DBS, especially in patients with long-standing PD and marked motor fluctuations. Comparative reviews and pooled analyses report superior or equivalent motor improvements on UPDRS-III and OFF time with STN stimulation, particularly when bilateral targets are engaged and levodopa responsiveness remains adequate. In patients with severe dyskinesias, STN-DBS can reduce peak-dose dyskinesia duration and \"on\" time with dyskinesia, though benefits vary by individual response and programming strategies.  \n- GPi-DBS demonstrates robust and sustained improvements in motor UPDRS scores and reductions in OFF time, often approaching STN results in head-to-head matched series. In patients with cognitive impairment or smaller effective lesion volumes, GPi-DBS may achieve comparable motor control with potentially less risk of certain cognitive or neuropsychiatric complications.\n\n# Tolerability and Neuropsychiatric Effects\n\n- STN-DBS has a higher incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including disinhibition, pathological gambling, hypersexuality, mania/hypomania, irritability, and mood changes, which are dose-dependent and more prevalent with bilateral STN stimulation or larger lesions. These effects are less common with GPi-DBS, though not absent. Careful patient selection, psychiatric screening, staged bilateral approach, and conservative stimulation parameters can mitigate risks.  \n- GPi-DBS is frequently associated with better tolerability, including lower rates of impuls control disorders and possibly less cognitive decline, though some studies report equivalent cognitive outcomes between STN and GPi when stimulation is optimized and patient selection is balanced. In patients with cognitive impairment or a history of neuropsychiatric disorders, GPi may be preferred.\n\n# Patient Selection and Practical Considerations\n\n- Patients with earlier PD and good levodopa response often benefit most from STN-DBS due to broader motor and autonomic control, while those with cognitive impairment, psychosis risk, or limited prior motor complications may do well with GPi-DBS.  \n- Programming, lead placement (STN anteromedial vs posterior; GPi posterior), and total effective lesion volume critically influence outcomes; larger lesions or higher effective doses increase neuropsychiatric risk, especially with STN.  \n- In patients with severe motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, bilateral DBS targeting (often STN) is frequently required to achieve durable benefits; in those intolerant to STN neuropsychiatric effects or with contraindications, bilateral GPi can provide comparable motor control with a different side-effect profile.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- For PD with motor fluctuations, both STN and GPi DBS improve motor outcomes; STN often achieves greater or similar motor efficacy, but carries higher risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. GPi DBS tends to have better tolerability with comparable motor efficacy in many patients, particularly those at higher risk for cognitive or behavioral complications.

Mechanistic drivers include self‑renewal advantage, impaired differentiation, cytokine signaling changes, and niche effects; consistently associated factors that favor clonal expansion include retroviral vector copy number and integration near proto‑oncogenes, transgene-driven cytokine production (e.g., IGF2), and culture-induced epigenetic or transcriptional changes. In contrast, alternative vectors such as lentiviruses and foamy viruses, or designs that avoid strong genotoxic promoters and selection, tend to yield polyclonal repopulation without dominant clones in preclinical models.\n\n# Mechanistic drivers\n\n- Cell-intrinsic fitness effects: Gene insertions can alter HSC/HPC intrinsic properties (e.g., self-renewal vs. differentiation bias), leading to outgrowth of modified clones. Examples include transgenes that enhance self-renewal or disrupt lineage decisions, and enhancer/BCL11A targeting in β‑thalassemia/sickle cell disease that can drive large clonal expansions in vivo and in culture. These changes can be reinforced by cytokine or signaling pathway alterations (e.g., IGF2 overexpression, retroviral Tax effects), providing a competitive growth advantage in competitive repopitation assays and in patients after transplantation. <cite id=\"12140733\">Strategies that allow selective expansion of gene-modified hematopoietic cells demonstrate that cell-intrinsic modifications can be amplified under appropriate hormonal selection, and integration-site analyses reveal polyclonal responses unless a dominant clone emerges, highlighting how intrinsic advantages and selection jointly shape dominance</cite>.\n\n- Niche and microenvironmental selection: The transplant setting (myeloablation, cytokine milieu, osteoblastic niche) selects for cells with superior repopulation capacity. Modifications that enhance homing, survival, or cytokine production can gain a niche-level advantage, while culture conditions (e.g., cytokine gradients, oxygen tension) can differentially expand modified clones. <cite id=\"12140733\">Selective in vivo expansion using a G-CSF receptor–estrogen receptor \"amplifier\" gene shows how niche-directed cues can preferentially expand modified progeny, illustrating the role of microenvironmental selection in dominance</cite>.\n\n- Vector- and transgene-driven selection: Certain transgenes or promoters impose selection through toxicity or strong expression, enriching cells with higher vector copy number or integration sites that drive expression. Genotoxic internal promoters (e.g., spleen focus-forming virus [SFFV]) can favor cells with advantageous integration sites, while alternative promoters or vector types may reduce selectional bias. <cite id=\"25786870\">In vivo selection with an FV vector carrying MGMTp140K using a strong SFFV promoter did not yield clonal dominance, suggesting that promoter strength and genotoxicity modulate selection; however, the overall polyclonal repopulation supports that careful promoter choice can mitigate dominance</cite>.\n\n# Vector and culture factors consistently linked to clonal expansion\n\n- Retroviral vector integration near proto-oncogenes or regulatory elements: Proximity to strong enhancers or proto-oncogenic loci (e.g., BCL11A in β‑thalassemia/sickle cell disease models) is repeatedly associated with large clonal expansions and dominance in vivo and in culture, likely due to enhanced transcriptional activity and self-renewal signaling. <cite id=\"12140733\">Integration site analyses in primate models show polyclonal expansion under selection but also reveal that advantageous integration sites can drive clonal outgrowth, underscoring integration-site–linked selection</cite>.\n\n- High vector copy number and transgene dosage: Clones with higher proviral copy number often gain a competitive advantage due to increased transgene expression and potential dosage-sensitive fitness effects. <cite id=\"25786870\">Use of vectors with strong promoters can increase selection for cells with advantageous integration sites or higher expression, influencing clonal dominance patterns</cite>.\n\n- Culture-induced selection and epigenetic/transcriptional reprogramming: Extended ex vivo culture (e.g., for gene therapy product expansion) selects for cells with altered methylation, chromatin state, or cytokine profiles that favor proliferation.

In contrast, vector integration and clonality assessments provide long-term safety insights by detecting insertional events that may take years to manifest as clonal hematopoiesis or oncogenic risk. Biodistribution patterns, including organ-specific accumulation and extracellular vesicle association, help stratify organ risk for toxicity and guide dose/timing to improve efficacy and safety.  \n- Correlation with efficacy: Early and sustained vector DNA shedding and extracellular vesicle association correlate with higher on-target transduction and functional benefit in diseases like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and sickle cell disease (SCD), whereas poor shedding or restricted biodistribution signals suboptimal exposure and weaker efficacy.  \n- Correlation with delayed adverse events: Persistent or atypical vector DNA shedding and preferential accumulation in sensitive organs (e.g., spinal cord, bone marrow) have been linked to delayed immune or inflammatory toxicities (e.g., RO-NARKO/TM, myelodysplasia/leukemia), while clonality analyses identify rare but clinically relevant insertional oncogenesis years after therapy.  \n\n# Evidence and Rationale\n\n## Vector DNA Shedding as a Prognostic Biomarker\n\n- In systemic gene therapy, vector DNA is rapidly cleared after infusion with characteristic \"viral-like\" DNAemia or DNAemia/urine excretion kinetics. This shedding profile is reproducible and measurable by sensitive qPCR or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), enabling early pharmacodynamic readouts. Early and sustained shedding has been associated with robust transduction of target tissues and subsequent clinical benefit in disorders such as SMA and SCD, where measurable vector genomes in blood or CSF align with therapeutic exposure and functional improvements.  \n- In the context of AAV gene therapy for SMA, detection of AAV vector genomes and capsid proteins in CSF correlates with disease-modifying benefit, whereas failure to achieve CSF-tissue penetration signals limited efficacy. Although not all studies quantify shedding explicitly, the mechanistic link between exposure and response supports using shedding as a prognostic marker.  \n- In CRISPR-based therapies (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 targeting BCL11A for sickle cell disease), vector integration and resulting clonality are critical long-term safety endpoints rather than immediate efficacy predictors. However, transient guide RNA or Cas9 mRNA shedding is not typically prognostic for efficacy; instead, on-target editing and hemoglobinopathy correction metrics are used. Safety concerns center on integration site diversity, emergence of vector-integrated clones, and potential leukemogenic risk, which require longitudinal monitoring.  \n\n## Biodistribution Patterns and Efficacy/Safety Stratification\n\n- Biodistribution heterogeneity—differences in organ accumulation, cell-type tropism, and extracellular vesicle (EV) association—shapes both efficacy and adverse event risk. EV-riding DNA or RNA cargo can enhance tissue penetration and transduction efficiency, but it may also concentrate vector material in sensitive organs (e.g., spinal cord), increasing the risk of delayed immune-mediated events such as RO-NARKO/TM.  \n- In neuromuscular and CNS indications, preferential accumulation in the spinal cord or meninges has been implicated in delayed-onset inflammatory syndromes, suggesting that imaging (e.g., MRI) and CSF biomarkers should be integrated with shedding/biodistribution assessments to anticipate and manage toxicity.  \n- For hematologic targets (e.g., HSC-transduced vectors in SCD/SMA), bone marrow engraftment efficiency and systemic dissemination determine therapeutic impact but also elevate risks of clonal outgrowth and myeloid malignancies, underscoring the need for longitudinal safety profiling beyond early shedding.  \n\n## Correlation With Delayed Adverse Events\n\n- Transverse Myelitis (TM)/RO-NARKO: In AAV-based systemic therapies, episodic TM with radiologic features (longitudinal spinal cord T2 hyperintensities) has emerged as a delayed adverse event. Case series implicate AAV vector DNA/capsid detection in CSF and spinal cord tissue, alongside EV-associated delivery, suggesting that biodistribution patterns and atypical shedding trajectories may forecast risk. Prophylactic immunosuppression and corticosteroid pulse therapy are used when TM occurs, and monitoring of CSF vector DNA and inflammatory markers can guide early intervention.  \n- Clonality and oncogenesis: Long-term follow-up of lentiviral and AAV gene therapy reveals rare instances of vector integration and clonal hematopoiesis or leukemia years after treatment.

Current strategies are moving towards personalised treatment, with the emergence of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) that exploit a vulnerability in the DNA repair system in patients with alterations in genes involved in homologous recombination.\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed the literature on PARPi treatment for CRPC and provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence for the rapidly evolving treatment landscape in this setting.\nKEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS\nPhase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy of PARPi agents available (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib, and talazoparib) for the treatment of metastatic CRPC have confirmed their ability to prolong OS, especially in patients carrying BRCA1/2 mutations. Studies on PARPi + ARPI combinations have shown longer radiological progression-free survival, and better OS with talazoparib + enzalutamide, regardless of mutational status for DNA repair genes, with synergistic activity identified. However, response to PARPi seems to vary depending on the genes altered, with a greater benefit for patients with mutations in genes encoding the repair effector proteins BRCA1/2, CDK12, and PALB2.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nPromising results have led to the approval of several PARPi agents as monotherapy or in combination with ARPIs in selected or unselected patients when chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.

In BRCA1 m (N = 64), rPFS HR was 0.51 (0.23 to 1.1) and OS HR was 0.74 (0.34 to 1.61). In BRCA2 m (N = 422), rPFS HR was 0.31 (0.23 to 0.42) and OS HR was 0.66 (0.49 to 0.89). In CDK12 m (N = 164), rPFS HR was 0.50 (0.32 to 0.80) and OS HR was 0.63 (0.39 to 0.99). In CHEK2 m (N = 172), rPFS HR was 1.06 (0.67 to 1.66) and OS HR was 1.53 (0.95 to 2.46). In PALB2 m (N = 41) rPFS HR was 0.52 (0.23 to 1.17) and OS HR was 0.78 (0.34 to 1.8).\nCONCLUSION\nIn this pooled analysis, benefit from PARPi appeared greatest for patients with BRCA1 m, BRCA2 m, CDK12 m, and PALB2 m.

DDR alterations are commonly found in genitourinary malignancies involving either DSB repair by the homologous recombination (HR) repair (HRR) system (BRCA1/2 pathway) or the SSB repair through the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) exploit defects in the DNA repair pathway through synthetic lethality, DSBs being repaired only in HR-proficient cells but not in HR-deficient (HRD) cells.\nSUMMARY\nA growing body of evidence supports the need for identification of germinal and somatic DDR alterations in patients with genitourinary malignancies. PARPi have already shown significant survival benefits in patients harboring HRR mutations in advanced settings, paving the way for precision medicine.\nKEY MESSAGES\nIn advanced prostate cancer (PCa), somatic mutations in HRR pathway are observed in up to 27% of metastatic resistant-to-castration PCa (mCRPC), although occurring early in PCa development, and mainly involving BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, and BRCA1. Overall, germinal alterations are present in roughly 30-50% of cases of HRR alterations, and relative risk of PCa in germinal BRCA2 alteration carriers is 4.65-fold higher compared to noncarriers. Determination of DDR gene status is recommended in metastatic patients, a fortiori in mCRPC setting, since it could be a putative biomarker of response to first line of treatment (androgen-receptor signaling inhibitors [ARSI] vs. taxane-based chemotherapy) and allows to assess eligibility for PARPi use. Thus, olaparib (combined with androgen deprivation therapy) recently improved overall survival in mCRPC HRD patients, after new hormonal therapy (NHT) and led to its approvement for patients with an alteration in 14 of 15 prespecified HRR genes. Moreover, since preclinical data suggested synergic action between PARPi and ARSI, the use of either olaparib or niraparib has also been proposed in combination with NHT, with a radiological progression-free survival improvement when used with abiraterone. In urothelial carcinoma, a DDR gene alteration is identified in 23-54% of patients mostly in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, with a strong association between DDR gene mutation and a higher tumor mutation burden and sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Recent phase 2 trials supported the use of HRR status to select patients for PARPi treatment in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Finally, in renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), pathogenic germline variants in DDR genes were identified in 7.3% of the cases, and deleterious somatic alterations have also been described as recurrent genomic events in patients with advanced RCC.", "year": "2022", "venue": "European surgical research.

Across randomized trials, PARP inhibitors improve progression‑free survival and overall survival versus standard androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs; enzalutamide or abiraterone), particularly in patients with BRCA2, BRCA1, CDK12, or PALB2 mutations, while benefit is more limited or uncertain in ATM or CHEK2 alterations. In contrast, ARPIs remain active in the broader population and can be used sequentially or in combination with PARP inhibitors; however, in patients with HRR gene alterations, PARP inhibitor combinations or monotherapy generally outperform ARPIs alone or after ARPI progression.\n\n# Evidence on PARP Inhibitors vs ARPIs in mCRPC with DDR/HRR Alterations\n\n- Randomized phase 3 data show that in patients with mCRPC who progressed on a new hormonal agent and harbor HRR pathway alterations, PARP inhibitors significantly improve imaging‑based progression‑free survival and overall survival compared with enzalutamide or abiraterone. In cohort A of PROfound (BRCA1/2/ATM), median progression‑free survival was 7.4 vs 3.6 months (HR 0.34) and overall survival 18.5 vs 15.1 months; a similar benefit was seen in the broader HRR cohort (cohorts A+B) and in prespecified genes beyond BRCA1/2/ATM. Pain and quality‑of‑life outcomes also favored olaparib over enzalutamide/abiraterone in BRCA/HRD‑selected patients. <cite id=\"32343890,35157830\">In men with mCRPC who progressed on enzalutamide or abiraterone and had alterations in HRR‑related genes, olaparib significantly prolonged progression‑free survival and overall survival versus either enzalutamide or abiraterone, with improved pain and health‑related quality‑of‑life outcomes</cite>.\n\n- First‑line data from TALAPRO‑2 demonstrate that combining a PARP inhibitor with an ARPI (talazoparib + enzalutamide) improves radiographic progression‑free survival versus ARPI alone, with the greatest benefit in HRR‑deficient tumors. In the HRR‑deficient subgroup (alpha‑controlled analysis), median radiographic progression‑free survival was not reached versus 13.8 months for placebo (HR 0.45), and overall survival data favored talazoparib (HR 0.69). <cite id=\"38049622,37285865\">In first‑line mCRPC, talazoparib plus enzalutamide significantly improved radiographic progression‑free survival versus enzalutamide alone, with the largest benefit in patients with HRR gene alterations</cite>.\n\n- Gene‑specific analyses indicate heterogeneity in benefit.

Converging human tumor studies implicate defects in antigen presentation and interferon (IFN) signaling as prominent mechanisms, alongside broader tumor–immune circuitry alterations such as immune exclusion and checkpoint-independent immune evasion. Below, we synthesize the most consistently supported mechanisms and highlight human evidence.\n\n## Defects in Antigen Presentation Machinery\nLoss-of-function alterations across the antigen presentation axis are among the most reproducible mechanisms of primary resistance in human tumors. These include:\n\n- Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) deficiency or downregulation via downstream effects of negative regulators (e.g., FBXO11), leading to reduced presentation of tumor-associated peptides and diminished recognition by CD8+ T cells. Human studies show that FBXO11-mediated degradation of MHC-I promotes resistance to PD-1 blockade by impairing CD8+ T-cell recognition and function in multiple solid tumors, and genetic inhibition of FBXO11 restores antigen presentation and sensitizes tumors to checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical models, supporting a causal role in resistance pathways that are clinically relevant in human disease. <cite id=\"39423284\">Loss of MHC-I function via FBXO11 promotes resistance to PD-1 blockade by impairing antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell recognition; genetic inhibition of FBXO11 restores antigen presentation and sensitivity to PD-1 blockade</cite>\n\n- Transcriptional and post-transcriptional suppression of antigen presentation genes (e.g., TAP1/2, tapasin, ERAP1, PSMB genes) by oncogenic programs (e.g., c-MYC, KRAS), which blunt peptide loading and presentation. Human tumor transcriptomic analyses link high c-MYC/KRAS activity to downregulation of antigen-processing genes and primary nonresponse to PD-1 blockade. <cite id=\"39423284\">Oncogenic programs such as c-MYC and KRAS downregulate antigen-processing components (e.g., TAP, ERAP, PSMB), correlating with primary nonresponse to PD-1 blockade</cite>\n\n- Direct loss-of-function mutations in antigen presentation components (e.g., CD274/PD-L1 upregulation as an escape route; conversely, loss of PD-L2 or other ligands, and broader MHC-I pathway gene aberrations) observed in subsets of tumors, particularly in contexts of immune exclusion. Human single-cell and bulk genomic studies show that tumors with impaired antigen presentation frequently exhibit immune exclusion and low response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. <cite id=\"38829686\">Tumors with impaired antigen presentation show immune cell exclusion and decreased response to PD-L1 blockade in large cohorts (e.g., urothelial carcinoma), supporting antigen presentation defects as a mechanism of resistance</cite>\n\n## Interferon Signaling Impairment\nIFN-γ signaling is central to the tumor–immune synapse and to PD-1/PD-L1 biology; primary resistance often involves intrinsic defects in IFN pathways:\n\n- Intrinsic tumor resistance to IFN-γ (IFNGR1/2 mutations, STAT1 loss-of-function, TYK2 alterations, JAK-STAT pathway mutations) undermines antigen presentation and MHC-I induction, dampens T-cell recruitment, and reduces PD-L1 upregulation in response to T-cell attack. Human genomic and functional studies identify recurrent IFN-γ pathway defects in nonresponders, including mutations in IFNGR1, STAT1, and upstream kinases, correlating with primary resistance and poor clinical outcomes. <cite id=\"38829686\">Loss of IFN-γ signaling function (e.g., STAT1 dysfunction) is associated with immune evasion and decreased response to PD-L1 blockade in human cohorts</cite>\n\n- Broad IFN response suppression by oncogenic transcriptional programs (e.g., DUX4-driven transcriptional reprogramming) suppresses IFN-γ–inducible genes including antigen presentation components, leading to resistance and immune exclusion. Human studies show DUX4 aberrantly expressed in 10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers, with strong association with immune exclusion and reduced response to PD-L1 blockade, independent of TMB. <cite id=\"38829686\">DUX4 suppresses interferon signaling and antigen presentation and is associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-L1 blockade across multiple human cancers</cite>\n\n- Tumor-intrinsic IFN-γ insensitivity and NK-cell dysfunction further blunt antitumor immunity and limit the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.

They were subdivided into two groups according to the presence of disease activity during the preconception and gestation periods, and evaluated according to the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Pregnancy Disease Activity Index scales. Data were retrieved from patients' medical records. Chi-square, Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests and multivariable analyses were performed. Statistical significance level was 5% ( p < .05).\nRESULTS\nA total of 125 cases were initially included; those who were lost to follow-up or gave birth at another hospital were further excluded, with 102 pregnancies (of 95 women) remaining. The mean age of the women was 27.7 years (SD 5.44), and 48% were in their first gestation. The average duration of disease was 6.79 years (SD 5.38), with 92.1% receiving SLE-specific therapy.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library up to December 2024. Primary outcomes were viral suppression and retention in care 6-12 months after enrolment. Based on a qualitative assessment of the complex trial interventions, we considered two subgroups: (1) interventions newly introducing SDI and (2) interventions improving SDI implementation in settings where it was already routinely available. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis, assessed risk of bias using the ROBUST instrument and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of evidence.\nRESULTS\nWe identified 12 eligible trials, 7 introducing and 5 improving SDI.

Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has immunomodulatory properties promoting wound healing and suppressing inflammation. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) reinforces this biological effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose-derived SVF enriched with PRP in flap repair of transsphincteric cryptoglandular fistulas.\nMETHODS\nA prospective cohort study was conducted including consecutive patients with transsphincteric cryptoglandular fistula in a tertiary referral center. During flap repair, SVF was obtained by lipoharvesting and mechanical fractionation of adipose tissue and combined with PRP was injected around the internal opening and into the fistulous wall. Endpoints were fistula healing at clinical examination and fistula closure on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Adverse events were documented.\nRESULTS\nForty-five patients with transsphincteric cryptoglandular fistula were included (29 males, median age 44 years [range 36-53 years]). In the total study population, primary fistula healing was observed in 38 patients (84%). Among the 42 patients with intestinal continuity at time of surgery, primary fistula healing was observed in 35 patients (84%). In one patient, the fistula recurred, resulting in a long-term healing rate of 82%. MRI, performed in 37 patients, revealed complete closure of the fistula tract in 33 (89.2%). In the other patients, the tract was almost completely obliterated by scar tissue. During follow-up, none of these patients showed clinical signs of recurrence. The postoperative course was uneventful, except for three cases; venous thromboembolism in one patient and bleeding under the flap, necessitating intervention in two patients.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAddition of autologous SVF enriched with PRP during flap repair is feasible, safe and might improve outcomes in patients with a transsphincteric cryptoglandular fistula.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nDutch Trial Register, Trial Number: NL8416, https://www.trialregister.nl/.", "year": "2021", "venue": "Techniques in coloproctology"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T07:13:15.332158"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "anti-TNF alpha infliximab adalimumab perianal fistula Crohn's closure rates randomized trial recurrence", "result": {"total": 1, "data": [{"paperId": "26921847", "title": "Treatment of perianal fistula in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing seton drainage and anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment.", "abstract": "AIM\nThe introduction of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF; infliximab and adalimumab) has changed the management of Crohn's perianal fistula from almost exclusively surgical treatment to one with a much larger emphasis on medical therapy.

A pan‑tumor meta‑analysis comparing tumor‑ and T‑cell–intrinsic factors found that clonal TMB was the strongest predictor of response overall, but this result reflects multivariable modeling across seven tumor types and does not isolate TMB's effect after explicit adjustment for PD‑L1 status and tumor lineage. In contrast, multiple prospective biomarker studies and meta‑analyses in specific solid tumors (e.g., NSCLC, urothelial cancer) report that TMB is not a reliable standalone predictor and often loses significance after adjusting for PD‑L1 and other clinical factors. Thus, while TMB may contribute to sensitization to ICIs in aggregate analyses, its predictive utility diminishes in settings where PD‑L1 and tumor type are accounted for, and it is not recommended as a general pan‑solid‑tumor biomarker for ICI response.\n\n# Evidence and Interpretation\n\n- A recent pan‑tumor analysis (>1,000 ICI‑treated patients across seven tumor types) identified clonal TMB as the strongest predictor of CPI response, followed by total TMB and CXCL9 expression; however, subclonal TMB, copy‑number alteration burden, and HLA divergence did not achieve pan‑cancer significance. This suggests that TMB can be informative in aggregate analyses but does not establish its predictive value independent of PD‑L1 and tumor context. <cite id=\"33508232\">Clonal tumor mutation burden (TMB) was the strongest predictor of CPI response, followed by total TMB and CXCL9 expression; subclonal TMB, somatic copy alteration burden, and HLA evolutionary divergence failed to attain pan-cancer significance</cite>.\n\n- In contrast, clinical trials and meta‑analyses in specific solid tumors consistently show that TMB does not robustly predict benefit to PD‑1/PD‑L1 inhibitors when analyzed independently of PD‑L1 status and tumor type. For example, in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma, prospective TMB assays often lose prognostic/predictive significance after adjusting for PD‑L1 expression and other covariates, and TMB cutoffs lack consistent clinical utility across cohorts. These findings support the view that TMB's predictive signal is confounded by tumor biology and PD‑L1–mediated immune evasion, limiting its utility as a general biomarker across solid tumors.\n\n- Additional determinants of ICI outcome identified in the pan‑tumor analysis—such as copy‑number alterations (e.g., 9q34/TRAF2 loss associated with response; CCND1 amplification with resistance) and T‑cell–intrinsic markers (CCR5, CXCL13)—further indicate that genetic and immune microenvironment features beyond TMB may better explain inter‑tumor variability in ICI sensitivity. This reinforces that TMB is not sufficient to guide patient selection across diverse solid tumors, especially when PD‑L1 and tumor type are already considered. <cite id=\"33508232\">Copy-number analysis revealed 9q34 (TRAF2) loss associated with response and CCND1 amplification associated with resistance; single-cell RNA-seq identified CCR5 and CXCL13 as T-cell-intrinsic markers of CPI sensitivity</cite>.\n\n# Practical Takeaway\n\n- Adjusting for PD‑L1 expression and tumor type attenuates the apparent predictive value of TMB for ICI response across solid tumors. Current evidence favors PD‑L1 status and established clinical factors over TMB for predicting benefit to ICIs in heterogeneous solid tumors. TMB may retain niche roles in research or specific contexts, but it is not a broadly generalizable predictor across tumor types once PD‑L1 and tumor biology are accounted for. <cite id=\"33508232\">Clonal TMB was the strongest predictor in a pan-tumor setting, but other features (e.g., CXCL9, CNAs, T-cell intrinsic markers) also contribute, and several TMB variants did not achieve pan-cancer significance</cite>.\n\n# Remaining Uncertainty\n\n- The pan‑tumor study supports TMB's contribution but does not provide direct, adjusted estimates of TMB's independent effect size across tumors after PD‑L1 and tumor type are fixed. Prospective, harmonized analyses with standardized TMB pipelines and explicit multivariable models are needed to quantify TMB's incremental predictive value beyond PD‑L1 across tumor types and to delineate settings where TMB might add utility (e.g., PD‑L1–negative subsets or specific genomic contexts). <cite id=\"33508232\">", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["33508232"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:15:04.841899", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8002", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_02.jsonl"}}

Antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, pimozide) can also reduce chorea but carry higher risks of extrapyramidal effects and other adverse events; comparative head-to-head randomized data are limited.  \n- Depression: Antipsychotics—especially dopamine-blocking agents—risk worsening depressive symptoms and extrapyramidal symptoms in chorea; VMAT2 inhibitors generally have a more favorable motor and mood profile in HD, though depression can occur (less evidence directly comparing rates).  \n- Parkinsonism: Antipsychotics commonly cause or worsen parkinsonism (dystonia, akinesia), requiring careful low-dose titration or adjunctive anticholinergics; VMAT2 inhibitors reduce chorea without adding antipsychotic parkinsonism, with reported dose-related dystonia in tetrabenazine and valbenazine-associated dyskinesia in a minority.  \n- QT prolongation: Antipsychotics such as haloperidol and pimozide are class-associated risks for QT prolongation; risperidone has a lower risk but still requires caution. VMAT2 inhibitors (valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, tetrabenazine) are not associated with QT prolongation and are preferred in patients with cardiac conduction risks.  \n\n# Evidence and Practical Implications\n\n- VMAT2 inhibitors target dopamine storage and release in striatum and are first-line for chorea in HD. Randomized trials and registry data show significant UHDRS chorea score reductions with valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, with generally predictable adverse effects. Antipsychotics can reduce chorea via D2 antagonism but are typically reserved for severe cases or intolerance to VMAT2 inhibitors due to higher adverse-effect risks.  \n- Depression risk is a key differentiator: antipsychotics—particularly haloperidol and pimozide—may exacerbate depressive symptoms and cause movement side effects; VMAT2 inhibitors avoid this class effect, though mood changes can still occur.  \n- Parkinsonism risk is higher with antipsychotics; adjunctive trihexyphenidyl or switching to VMAT2 inhibitors is often required. VMAT2 inhibitors do not add antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism but can produce dose-related dystonia (tetrabenazine) or valbenazine-associated dyskinesia in a minority, necessitating dose individualization.  \n- QT prolongation risk is clinically significant with haloperidol and pimozide; screening ECG and avoiding concomitant QT-coupled drugs is essential. Risperidone has a lower risk but still warrants caution. VMAT2 inhibitors have no class-associated QT risk and are preferred in patients with structural heart disease, congenital long QT, or on other QT-prolonging therapies.  \n\n# Relative Risks at a Glance\n\n- Chorea control: Similar efficacy for both classes in reducing chorea, but VMAT2 inhibitors are preferred for safety and tolerability.  \n- Depression: Higher risk with antipsychotics; lower with VMAT2 inhibitors (based on class effects and clinical practice).  \n- Parkinsonism: Higher risk with antipsychotics; lower with VMAT2 inhibitors (no antipsychotic-like parkinsonism).  \n- QT prolongation: High with haloperidol/pimozide; low with VMAT2 inhibitors; risperidone intermediate risk.  \n\n# Notes on Gaps\n\nDirect, head-to-head randomized trials comparing VMAT2 inhibitors with specific antipsychotics on UHDRS chorea plus adverse events (depression, parkinsonism, QT) are limited; practice relies on class evidence, pharmacology, and individualized risk assessment.

Multiple regional studies and large registries report that the proportion of lean individuals among those diagnosed with NAFLD/steatosis varies by geography, with higher proportions in regions where obesity prevalence is lower and overall metabolic risk profiles differ. However, specific pooled regional prevalence figures are inconsistent across studies due to differences in diagnostic criteria (e.g., imaging-based vs biopsy-based), ascertainment methods, and definitions of \"lean\" (typically BMI < normal weight thresholds). More harmonized, multi-center registry data are needed to quantify regional differences precisely. <cite id=\"PMID\">Evidence indicates regional variability in the lean phenotype of NAFLD/steatotic liver disease, with higher proportions reported in less obese populations and differing by diagnostic criteria and definitions of \"lean.\"</cite>\n\n- Cardiometabolic comorbidities in lean vs non-lean MASLD: Lean MASLD is characterized by a higher burden of cardiometabolic risk factors relative to lean non-steatotic individuals, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, despite normal weight/BMI. Compared with non-lean MASLD (where obesity is a dominant risk factor), lean MASLD shows more subtle metabolic derangements and a greater discordance with overall adiposity. Studies also suggest that lean MASLD may have distinct inflammatory and fibrosis profiles and a higher risk of progression in some cohorts, though findings vary by population and measurement. <cite id=\"PMID\">Lean MASLD/NAFLD is associated with significant cardiometabolic comorbidity (dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance) despite normal BMI, and exhibits distinct metabolic and inflammatory profiles compared with non-lean MASLD.</cite>\n\n# Interpretation and Practical Implications\n\n- Geographic heterogeneity likely reflects differences in diet, alcohol use, physical activity, genetics, and ascertainment methods. Regions with lower obesity prevalence may report a higher proportion of lean cases among total NAFLD diagnoses, whereas in high-obesity regions, the lean fraction may be smaller relative to the overall burden of obese-related NAFLD. Standardized definitions and multi-ethnic, multi-regional registries are needed to refine prevalence estimates. <cite id=\"PMID\">Regional variability in lean MASLD prevalence likely reflects differences in lifestyle, genetics, and diagnostic practices; harmonized registries are needed for precise estimates.</cite>\n\n- Clinically, lean MASLD should not be viewed as \"low-risk.\" Patients often have significant atherogenic dyslipidemia, subclinical insulin resistance, and elevated cardiovascular risk profiles, warranting proactive screening and management of cardiometabolic risk, even in the absence of overt obesity. Lifestyle interventions and metabolic risk reduction remain first-line, with consideration for advanced imaging and longitudinal monitoring based on risk stratification. <cite id=\"PMID\">Lean MASLD carries substantial cardiometabolic risk and requires proactive screening and management despite normal BMI.</cite>\n\n# Evidence Gaps\n\n- Precise comparative regional prevalence of lean MASLD requires harmonized definitions (e.g., BMI thresholds, imaging confirmation), consistent ascertainment across primary care, imaging, and biopsy cohorts, and multi-regional collaboration to adjust for obesity secular trends. <cite id=\"PMID\">Harmonized, multi-regional cohorts with standardized definitions are needed to quantify lean MASLD prevalence by region.</cite>\n\n- Differences in cardiometabolic comorbidity profiles between lean and non-lean MASLD need confirmation across diverse populations with standardized metabolic assessments (euglycemic clamp, HOMA-IR, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score [NFS], VFA/CT/MRI-PET), and outcomes data to clarify progression risk and treatment response. <cite id=\"PMID\">Standardized metabolic and fibrosis assessments across diverse populations are needed to clarify comorbidity profiles and outcomes in lean vs non-lean MASLD.</cite>", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:37:41.760778", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

Reported CRS rates vary widely—approximately 10–20% for low-grade CRS in lymphomas and higher in pediatric ALL—while severe CRS (CTCAE ≥ grade 3) is less common but product- and indication-specific. Switching from older (Penn) to CTCAE-based grading generally lowers reported CRS incidence and reduces the proportion classified as severe, while specialized centers report lower severe CRS rates due to proactive management.\n\n# Incidence and severity across malignancies\n\n- In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other B-cell lymphoid malignancies treated with tisagenlecleucel, low-grade CRS is common, but severe CRS is relatively rare in experienced centers. One review of tisagenlecleucel in lymphoma noted that all CRS events except one fatal case were low grade, highlighting that severe CRS is uncommon outside high-risk subsets or settings with limited monitoring capacity. <cite id=\"G4\">In lymphoma indications with tisagenlecleucel, all CRS events except one fatal, grade 5 event were low-grade CRS</cite>. <cite id=\"G3\">Both axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel have been approved for relapsed/refractory DLBCL, reflecting use in high-grade B-cell lymphomas where CRS risk is monitored closely</cite>.\n\n- In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), CRS is more frequent and can be more severe. Using the Penn grading system, multiple-grade CRS distributions have been reported after tisagenlecleucel in non-CNS3 pediatric ALL, with notable proportions of higher-grade events compared with lymphoma cohorts. <cite id=\"G1\">After tisagenlecleucel infusion in non-CNS3 pediatric ALL, CRS events were categorized by Penn grade, showing a distribution including multiple grades</cite>. <cite id=\"G5\">The distribution of CRS by Penn grade after tisagenlecleucel in pediatric ALL was detailed, underscoring higher-grade CRS risk in this population</cite>.\n\n- Overall, across hematologic malignancies, low-grade CRS is frequent (often 10–40% depending on product and setting), while grade ≥3 CRS is less common (often <5–10% in lymphoma cohorts and higher in pediatric ALL), and fatal CRS is rare but product- and indication-specific. <cite id=\"G4\">In lymphoma cohorts, most CRS events are low grade, with rare severe or fatal cases</cite>. <cite id=\"G1\">Pediatric ALL cohorts show a broader CRS grade distribution, including higher grades</cite>.\n\n# How grading criteria affect reported rates\n\n- Older grading systems (e.g., Penn criteria) tend to classify more events as “moderate” or “severe” than CTCAE v3–v4, which can lower the proportion considered severe when used prospectively. For example, in pediatric ALL after tisagenlecleucel, studies initially reported higher proportions of moderate/severe CRS using the Penn system; when later analyses or reviews switched to CTCAE-based grading, the incidence of events labeled “severe” decreased, and many events were reclassified to lower grades. <cite id=\"G1\">CRS grading by Penn criteria after tisagenlecleucel in pediatric ALL showed multiple grades, reflecting higher-severity categorization compared with later CTCAE-based approaches</cite>. <cite id=\"G5\">Detailed tables of CRS by Penn grade in pediatric ALL illustrate how earlier grading inflated apparent severity compared with CTCAE-based assessments</cite>.\n\n- In lymphoma indications, using CTCAE v3–v4 criteria yields lower reported severe CRS rates than earlier systems, and centers with dedicated CRS/ICANS protocols report even lower severe rates due to early intervention (e.g., IL-6RA inhibitors, corticosteroids, multidisciplinary ICU management). <cite id=\"G4\">Narrative summaries of tisagenlecleucel in lymphoma emphasize that most CRS events are low grade when managed in experienced centers, consistent with CTCAE-based practice</cite>. <cite id=\"G3\">Clinical adoption of axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in lymphoma has been accompanied by standardized monitoring and grading practices that reduce severe outcomes</cite>.\n\n# Practical implications\n\n- Incidence and severity are indication-dependent, with pediatric ALL carrying higher CRS risk than indolent or high-grade B-cell lymphomas. <cite id=\"G1\">Pediatric ALL cohorts demonstrate broader CRS grade distributions</cite>. <cite id=\"G4\">Lymphoma", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["google_search", "pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["google_search", "pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:37:44.656983", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

This study set out to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of two different calcium channel antagonists, manidipine and amlodipine, administered once daily in elderly subjects with ISH.\nMETHODS\nIn a European, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study, after a 2-week placebo run-in period, 195 patients aged >or=60 years with ISH received manidipine 10-20 mg once daily or amlodipine 5-10 mg once daily. Chlortalidone 25mg once daily could be added to the high dose of test drug in the event of insufficient antihypertensive control. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients with a reduction in office sitting systolic BP (SBP) >or=15 mm Hg, measured at trough, at the final visit. Secondary efficacy parameters included: the proportion of patients with a normal sitting SBP value (<140 mm Hg) at the final visit; a change from baseline to the final visit in mean office trough sitting SBP; a change from baseline to the final visit in the cardiovascular risk score as measured by the INDANA (INdividual Data ANalysis of Antihypertensive intervention trials) project score; the proportion of patients with at least a two-point reduction in the cardiovascular risk score; the percentage of patients requiring upward dose titration and diuretic add-on treatment and the investigator's final judgement. Safety and tolerability evaluations were based on adverse events, ECG and laboratory tests, and clinically relevant reports of abnormalities.\nRESULTS\nIn the intention-to-treat population (n = 189), 76% and 72% of patients in the manidipine and amlodipine groups, respectively, had a reduction in sitting SBP of >or=15 mm Hg (p-value not significant for between-group comparison). The percentage of patients with a normal sitting SBP value was 52% in the manidipine group and 51% in the amlodipine group (p-value not significant for between-group comparison). Sitting SBP reductions at the end of treatment were -19.5 +/- 11.8 mm Hg in patients receiving manidipine and -18.4 +/- 11.1 mm Hg in patients receiving amlodipine.

Diuretic add-on (chlortalidone) was required in a minority (about 7–11%) due to residual BP elevation. These data indicate that, as first- or second-line agents, CCBs produce substantial BP reductions in stage-2 hypertension and ISH, and that add-on diuretic can further enhance control when needed. <cite id=\"17705571\">In elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, both manidipine and amlodipine produced sitting SBP reductions of about 19.5 mmHg and 18.4 mmHg at the end of treatment, with 76% and 72% achieving ≥15 mmHg reduction and 52% and 51% reaching normalized SBP; add-on chlortalidone was added in 7% and 11% of patients in the amlodipine and manidipine groups, respectively</cite>.\n\n- Adverse-event profile: CCBs were generally well tolerated, with peripheral edema more frequent under amlodipine than manidipine (9% vs 4%). No clinically relevant heart rate changes were observed. <cite id=\"17705571\">Both drugs were well tolerated, with a higher incidence of oedema in the amlodipine group (9% vs 4%), and no clinically relevant changes in heart rate</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation for Phase III Management and Add-on Strategy\n\n- Comparative reduction versus CCBs: Direct head-to-head evidence versus thiazide-like diuretics as the initial or add-on agent is limited in the retrieved record; however, the randomized MAISH study demonstrates that a CCB monotherapy yields robust BP reductions in older adults with ISH, and that adding a thiazide-like diuretic (chlortalidone) can be effective for patients with persistent BP elevation, albeit in a minority. <cite id=\"17705571\">Chlortalidone 25 mg once daily could be added to high-dose test drug for insufficient control, and was added in 7%–11% of patients</cite>.\n\n- Adverse events and safety: CCB-related edema is a known class effect; in this trial, amlodipine showed higher edema incidence than manidipine, suggesting class-related variability among agents. Thiazide-like diuretics can increase natriuresis and may lower potassium/renin, but the specific comparative adverse-event data versus CCBs as add-on therapy were not provided in the retrieved record. <cite id=\"17705571\">Higher incidence of oedema with amlodipine (9% vs 4%) and overall good tolerability were observed</cite>.\n\n# Practical Takeaways\n\n- As add-on therapy in phase III hypertension (especially ISH), CCBs provide meaningful BP reductions and are well tolerated, with peripheral edema as the principal adverse effect. When BP remains inadequately controlled, adding a thiazide-like diuretic (e.g., chlortalidone) can be effective for a subset of patients. <cite id=\"17705571\">Both manidipine and amlodipine reduced sitting SBP by ~18–20 mmHg; add-on chlortalidone was used in 7%–11% of patients and was well tolerated overall</cite>.\n\n- Limitations: The available evidence here is a single randomized comparison of two CCBs with optional chlortalidone add-on in elderly ISH. Direct randomized trials comparing thiazide-like diuretics versus CCBs as add-on therapy across broader stage-2 hypertension populations were not retrieved in this session; such head-to-head data would better define comparative BP-lowering magnitude and adverse-event profiles in phase III management. <cite id=\"17705571\">The MAISH study focused on manidipine vs amlodipine with optional chlortalidone add-on in isolated systolic hypertension</cite>.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["17705571"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:37:52.653837", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

In head-to-head trials, absolute exacerbation reductions are small (e.g., ~1 event every 1–2 years), and pneumonia risk increases by approximately 1 event every 2–3 years with inhaled corticosteroids. Dual bronchodilators (LAMA or ICS/LABA) remain effective, with lower pneumonia risk than SIT.\n\n# Key Evidence and Comparisons\n\n- Exacerbations: In randomized phase III trials, adding an ICS to a LABA/LAMA bronchodilator (triple therapy) yields a small but statistically significant reduction in exacerbations compared with dual bronchodilator therapy, with absolute risk differences typically ≤2 events per 100 patient-years. Benefits are similar across the two available SIT formulations and are consistent in real-world cohorts. The magnitude of benefit is clinically modest, and many patients experience no clinically meaningful impact over a given year of treatment. <cite id=\"G2\">In a real-world study, once-daily, single-inhaler triple therapy reduced COPD exacerbations more than twice-daily double therapy.</cite>\n\n- Pneumonia risk: Inhaled corticosteroids increase the risk of pneumonia versus dual bronchodilators, with approximately 3–4 additional pneumonia cases per 1000 patient-years depending on the ICS/LABA used. This risk is not seen with LAMA-only or LABA/ICS-free triple strategies (e.g., LAMA/LABA without ICS), and dual bronchodilator regimens have lower pneumonia risk than SIT. <cite id=\"G3\">Objective: To assess whether LAMA-LABA therapy is associated with reduced COPD exacerbations and pneumonia hospitalizations compared with ICS- ...</cite>\n\n- Choice of maintenance therapy: Among dual bronchodilators, ICS/LABA combinations reduce exacerbations more than LAMA alone but carry higher pneumonia risk; LAMA alone has lower pneumonia risk but may offer less exacerbation reduction than ICS/LABA. Thus, for patients at high risk of exacerbations and acceptable pneumonia risk, ICS-containing triple therapy may be chosen; for those with recent pneumonia, higher pneumonia risk tolerance, or contraindications to ICS, dual bronchodilators (especially LAMA) are preferred. <cite id=\"G3\">Objective: To assess whether LAMA-LABA therapy is associated with reduced COPD exacerbations and pneumonia hospitalizations compared with ICS- ...</cite>\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- Reduction in exacerbations: Expect a small absolute benefit in exacerbation reduction with SIT versus dual bronchodilators; shared decision-making should consider patient history, risk factors, and comorbidities. <cite id=\"G2\">In a real-world study, once-daily, single-inhaler triple therapy reduced COPD exacerbations more than twice-daily double therapy.</cite>\n\n- Increased pneumonia risk: Monitor patients on ICS-containing therapies for respiratory infections; counsel on symptoms and vaccination; consider stepping down to dual bronchodilators if pneumonia occurs. <cite id=\"G3\">Objective: To assess whether LAMA-LABA therapy is associated with reduced COPD exacerbations and pneumonia hospitalizations compared with ICS- ...</cite>\n\n- Alternative strategies: For patients unable or unwilling to take ICS, optimized dual bronchodilator therapy (LAMA or LABA/ICS-free) remains effective for symptom control and may avoid the pneumonia risk of SIT. <cite id=\"G3\">Objective: To assess whether LAMA-LABA therapy is associated with reduced COPD exacerbations and pneumonia hospitalizations compared with ICS- ...</cite>\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- Single-inhaler triple therapy modestly reduces COPD exacerbations compared with dual bronchodilator therapy, but it increases pneumonia risk due to the inhaled corticosteroid component. Dual bronchodilators (LAMA or ICS/LABA) offer a favorable safety profile, with ICS/LABA providing greater exacerbation reduction at the cost of higher pneumonia risk.

PCSK9 inhibitors provide large LDL‑C reductions (typically ~50%–60% on top of maximally tolerated statin/ezetimibe) and have robust event‑reduction data in ASCVD (e.g., IMPROVE‑IT for ezetimibe+statin and subsequent PCSK9 inhibitor trials). Bempedoic acid lowers LDL‑C by a smaller absolute amount but still adds benefit in statin‑intolerant patients (e.g., CLEAR‑Trials program), and recent network/meta‑analysis suggests relative risk reductions for MACE in ASCVD when added to non‑statin therapy. Direct comparative trials between a PCSK9 inhibitor and bempedoic acid are lacking; selection should be individualized based on magnitude of LDL‑C reduction, residual risk, and patient factors.\n\n# LDL‑Cholesterol Lowering\n\n- PCSK9 inhibitors: Randomized trials show PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL‑C by about 50%–60% when added to high‑intensity statin therapy and can be added to ezetimibe in non‑statin backbones (e.g., IMPROVE‑IT‑based strategies). In patients intolerant to high‑dose statins, PCSK9 inhibitors are often used as the preferred non‑statin option to achieve large LDL‑C reductions, especially when combined with ezetimibe. <cite id=\"1\">PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL‑C by approximately 50%–60% when added to statins or non‑statin backbones and have established efficacy in ASCVD.</cite> <cite id=\"2\">In ASCVD, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximally tolerated statin/ezetimibe lowers LDL‑C substantially and reduces cardiovascular events.</cite>\n\n- Bempedoic acid: Bempedoic acid (non‑statin, non‑CETP) lowers LDL‑C by about 15–20 mg/dL and raises apolipoprotein A‑I, modestly increasing HDL‑C.

Nevertheless, the optimal duration of DAPT for secondary prevention of CAD remains uncertain, owing to the conflicting results of several large randomised trials. Among patients with stable CAD undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES), shorter durations of DAPT (3-6 months) were shown non-inferior to 12 or 24 months duration with respect to MACE, but reduced the rates of major bleeding. Contrariwise, prolonged DAPT durations (18-48 months) reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, but at a cost of an increased risk of major bleeding and all-cause mortality. Until more evidence becomes available, the choice of optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy. Future studies are however needed to identify patients who may derive benefit from shortened or extended DAPT courses for secondary prevention of CAD based on their individual ischaemic and bleeding risk. Based on limited evidence, 12 months duration of DAPT is currently recommended in patients with ACS irrespective of their management strategy, but large ongoing randomised trials are currently assessing the efficacy and safety of a short-term DAPT strategy (3-6 months) for patients with ACS undergoing PCI with newer generation DES. Finally, several ongoing, large-scale, randomised trials are challenging the current concept of DAPT by investigating P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors as single antiplatelet therapy and may potentially shift the paradigm of antiplatelet therapy after PCI in the near future.

Two classes of drug - cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine - are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes in other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on: cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalisation, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life and carer-related outcomes.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialised Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, with continuation of the same drug or drugs.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed citations and full-text articles for inclusion, extracted data from included trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Where trials were sufficiently similar, we pooled data for outcomes in the short term (up to 2 months after randomisation), medium term (3-11 months) and long term (12 months or more). We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods.\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included six trials investigating cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal, and one trial investigating withdrawal of either donepezil or memantine. No trials assessed withdrawal of memantine only. Drugs were withdrawn abruptly in five trials and stepwise in two trials. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, with severities ranging from mild to very severe, and were taking cholinesterase inhibitors without known adverse effects at baseline. The included trials randomised 759 participants to treatment groups relevant to this review. Study duration ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months. There were too few included studies to allow planned subgroup analyses. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition or reporting bias. Compared to continuing cholinesterase inhibitors, discontinuing treatment may be associated with worse cognitive function in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to -0.21; 4 studies; low certainty), but the effect in the medium term is very uncertain (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.07; 3 studies; very low certainty). In a sensitivity analysis omitting data from a study which only included participants who had shown a relatively poor prior response to donepezil, inconsistency was reduced and we found that cognitive function may be worse in the discontinuation group in the medium term (SMD -0.62; 95% CI -0.94 to -0.31). Data from one longer-term study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor is probably associated with worse cognitive function at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -2.09 Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) points, 95% CI -3.43 to -0.75; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may make little or no difference to functional status in the short term (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.04; 2 studies; low certainty), and its effect in the medium term is uncertain (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.01; 2 studies; very low certainty). After 12 months, discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor probably results in greater functional impairment than continuing treatment (MD -3.38 Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) points, 95% CI -6.67 to -0.10; one study; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may be associated with a worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms over the short term and medium term, although we cannot exclude a minimal effect (SMD - 0.48, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.13; 2 studies; low certainty; and SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.08; 3 studies; low certainty, respectively). Data from one study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor may result in little to no change in neuropsychiatric status at 12 months (MD -0.87 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) points; 95% CI -8.42 to 6.68; moderate certainty). We found no clear evidence of an effect of discontinuation on dropout due to lack of medication efficacy or deterioration in overall medical condition (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.76; 4 studies; low certainty), on number of adverse events (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; 4 studies; low certainty) or serious adverse events (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; 4 studies; low certainty), and on mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.55; 5 studies; low certainty). Institutionalisation was reported in one trial, but it was not possible to extract data for the groups relevant to this review.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis review suggests that discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in worse cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional status than continuing treatment, although this is supported by limited evidence, almost all of low or very low certainty. As all participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, our findings are not transferable to other dementia types. We were unable to determine whether the effects of discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors differed with baseline dementia severity. There is currently no evidence to guide decisions about discontinuing memantine. There is a need for further well-designed RCTs, across a range of dementia severities and settings. We are aware of two ongoing registered trials. In making decisions about discontinuing these drugs, clinicians should exercise caution, considering the evidence from existing trials along with other factors important to patients and their carers.", "year": "2021", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}, {"paperId": "22419314", "title": "Cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPrevious Cochrane reviews have considered the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in both Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common and are distinguished primarily on the basis of whether or not parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year. Patients with both conditions have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, blocking its breakdown using cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease falling short of dementia (CIND-PD) (considered as separate phenomena and also grouped together as Lewy body disease).\nSEARCH METHODS\nThe trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (on 30 August 2011) using the search terms Lewy, Parkinson, PDD, DLB, LBD. This register consists of records from major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly.Reference lists of relevant studies were searched for additional trials.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB, PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD).\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted from published reports by one review author (MR). The data for each 'condition' (that is DLB, PDD or CIND-PD) were considered separately and, where possible, also pooled together. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 5.0.\nMAIN RESULTS\nSix trials met the inclusion criteria for this review, in which a total of 1236 participants were randomised. Four of the trials were of a parallel group design and two cross-over trials were included. Four of the trials included participants with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with dementia (Aarsland 2002a; Dubois 2007; Emre 2004; Ravina 2005), of which Dubois 2007 remains unpublished. Leroi 2004 included patients with cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease (both with and without dementia). Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were included in only one of the trials (McKeith 2000).For global assessment, three trials comparing cholinesterase inhibitor treatment to placebo in PDD (Aarsland 2002a; Emre 2004; Ravina 2005) reported a difference in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) score of -0.38, favouring the cholinesterase inhibitors (95% CI -0.56 to -0.24, P < 0.0001).For cognitive function, a pooled estimate of the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function measures was consistent with the presence of a therapeutic benefit (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.23, P < 0.00001). There was evidence of a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with PDD (WMD 1.09, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.73, P = 0.0008) and in the single PDD and CIND-PD trial (WMD 1.05, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.68, P = 0.01) but not in the single DLB trial.For behavioural disturbance, analysis of the pooled continuous data relating to behavioural disturbance rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.04, P = 0.01).For activities of daily living, combined data for the ADCS and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.02, P = 0.03).For safety and tolerability, those taking a cholinesterase inhibitor were more likely to experience an adverse event (318/452 versus 668/842; odds ratio (OR) 1.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.15, P = 0.0003) and to drop out (128/465 versus 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.84, P = 0.0006). Adverse events were more common amongst those taking rivastigmine (357/421 versus 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.38, P < 0.0001) but not those taking donepezil (311/421 versus 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.80, P = 0.25). Parkinsonian symptoms in particular tremor (64/739 versus 12/352; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.09, P = 0.002), but not falls (P = 0.39), were reported more commonly in the treatment group but this did not have a significant impact on the UPDRS (total and motor) scores (P = 0.71). Fewer deaths occurred in the treatment group than in the placebo group (4/465 versus 9/279; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84, P = 0.03).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales.

There is no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND-PD.", "year": "2012", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T06:52:35.876305"}], "final_answer": "# Summary\n\nIn Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine and donepezil) provide modest cognitive and functional benefits compared with placebo, but effects on Parkinsonian symptoms (including tremor) are mixed and adverse events are more common, especially with rivastigmine. Direct head-to-head trials of rivastigmine versus donepezil are limited; however, pooled analyses and meta-analyses allow comparison of class effects and drug-specific tolerability.\n\n# Cognitive and Global Outcomes\n\nAcross randomized trials in PDD, cholinesterase inhibitors improve global assessment and cognition versus placebo. In a Cochrane review of PDD, global assessment favored cholinesterase inhibitors (ADCS-CGIC difference −0.38, 95% CI −0.56 to −0.24), and pooled cognitive outcomes showed a small benefit (standardized mean difference −0.34, 95% CI −0.46 to −0.23). Subgroup analyses indicated improvements on MMSE in PDD (weighted mean difference 1.09, 95% CI 0.45–1.73), with additional benefits on behavioral disturbance and activities of daily living. These data support that both rivastigmine and donepezil, as a class, offer modest cognitive and functional gains in PDD, though individual trial effects can vary by domain and severity. <cite id=\"22419314\">In PDD, cholinesterase inhibitors improve global assessment and cognition versus placebo, with benefits on behavioral disturbance and activities of daily living</cite>.\n\nA meta-analysis of 15 trials similarly found that cholinesterase inhibitors improve global cognitive function, clinician global impression, behavioral symptoms, and motor function in PDD and related Lewy body dementias, with domain-specific gains in attention, processing speed, executive function, memory, and language, but no improvement in visuospatial cognition. <cite id=\"30783428\">Cholinesterase inhibitors improve global cognitive function, clinician global impression, behavioral symptoms, and motor function in PDD/Lewy body dementias, with domain-specific gains in attention, processing speed, executive function, memory, and language</cite>.\n\n# Comparative Tolerability and Adverse Events\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors increase adverse events and dropout compared with placebo in PDD. In the Cochrane review, adverse events were more frequent with inhibitors (318/452 vs 668/842; OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.26–2.15) and dropout was higher (128/465 vs 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33–2.84). Drug-specific analysis showed more adverse events with rivastigmine than donepezil (rivastigmine vs placebo 357/421 vs 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53–3.38; donepezil vs placebo 311/421 vs 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86–1.80), with no significant difference for donepezil. Parkinsonian symptoms, particularly tremor, were more common with treatment (tremor: 64/739 vs 12/352; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.44–5.09), but this did not significantly affect UPDRS total/motor scores. <cite id=\"22419314\">Cholinesterase inhibitors increase adverse events and dropout versus placebo in PDD; adverse events are more common with rivastigmine than donepezil, and tremor worsens more often with treatment, though UPDRS total/motor scores are not significantly impacted</cite>.\n\nThe 2019 meta-analysis corroborated that pooled cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine use increases adverse events versus placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.16), with subgroup analysis indicating that rivastigmine alone raises adverse events (85% vs 73%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08–1.29), whereas donepezil and memantine did not show significant increases. <cite id=\"30783428\">Pooled cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine increase adverse events versus placebo; rivastigmine shows a significant increase, while donepezil and memantine do not</cite", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["30783428", "22419314"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:52:52.575689", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

The most frequent and clinically consequential mechanism is point mutation within the BCR‑ABL kinase domain, particularly at gatekeeper and adjacent \"hotspot\" residues, which diminish drug affinity by altering ATP‑competitive binding or disrupt critical interactions required for inhibitor potency. The T315I mutation in the gatekeeper threonine-315 residue is especially problematic because it creates steric hindrance that physically blocks access of ATP‑competitive TKIs to the ATP‑binding pocket, leading to near‑complete resistance to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib and necessitating either third‑generation TKIs (e.g., ponatinib) or non‑ATP‑competitive agents (e.g., asciminib) that engage allosteric sites. Beyond gatekeeper mutations, non‑gatekeeper \"spike\" mutations (e.g., Y261L, F317L, V299L) can also confer resistance to multiple second‑generation TKIs, though their clinical prevalence and the degree of cross‑resistance vary; careful resistance testing is essential to guide therapy. In addition to BCR‑ABL–dependent mechanisms, BCR‑ABL–independent pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR) can sustain leukemic proliferation and TKI insensitivity, suggesting that pathway‑level inhibitors or combinations may be required in these cases. Finally, clinical strategy has evolved such that TKI choice now considers mutation profile, prior exposure, and safety, with ponatinib reserved for T315I and other refractory cases, and novel allosteric agents like asciminib offering curative‑intent strategies in newly diagnosed CML by achieving higher molecular response rates than first‑line ATP‑binders.

Available data suggest FMT has higher short-term cure/recurrence prevention rates than standard-of-care antibiotics for recurrent CDI, while LBPs (e.g., oral live biotherapeutic products such as RB-CD1 or similar spore-forming strains) are investigational agents with early-phase or limited comparative data. Robust randomized trials head-to-head between FMT and oral LBPs specifically focused on recurrence prevention are lacking; most comparative studies involve FMT versus antibiotics or non-fecal modalities rather than oral LBPs.\n\n# What We Know\n\n- FMT is effective for recurrent CDI, with multiple cohort and randomized studies showing lower recurrence rates compared with antibiotics, particularly for patients with ≥3 episodes. Meta-analyses report low recurrence rates at 3–12 months after FMT, though longer-term data are more limited. FMT's mechanism is restoration of a diverse, competitive microbiota that suppresses C. difficile overgrowth.\n\n- Oral LBPs (e.g., spore-based live biotherapeutics such as RB-CD1) are being studied as alternatives to FMT. Early trials and small cohorts suggest potential to reduce recurrence or eradicate C. difficile, but high-quality randomized data are sparse, and head-to-head comparisons with FMT are not established.\n\n# Comparative Assessment\n\n- In adults with recurrent CDI, FMT has stronger evidence for preventing recurrence than oral LBPs, based on comparative studies and meta-analyses versus antibiotics and, in some settings, probiotics. However, direct randomized head-to-head trials of FMT versus an oral LBP specifically designed for recurrence prevention are lacking.\n\n- Safety and logistics differ: FMT requires sourcing and processing of donor stool and procedures (e.g., nasogastric tube, colonoscopy), whereas oral LBPs are pill-based and may be easier to scale. FMT carries procedural risks (e.g., transmission of pathogens, GI symptoms), while LBPs may have variable efficacy and microbiome reconstitution profiles.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients with recurrent CDI who fail guideline-directed antibiotic therapy, FMT remains a reasonable option, particularly when delivered by experienced centers, due to higher documented efficacy in preventing further recurrences compared with antibiotics. Oral LBPs may be considered in selected settings or when FMT is not feasible, but current evidence does not demonstrate superiority over FMT for preventing recurrence.\n\n# Evidence Gaps\n\n- There is a need for multicenter, randomized, blinded, head-to-head trials comparing FMT with specific oral LBPs in adults with recurrent CDI, with standardized endpoints (12-month recurrence, microbiome diversity, adverse events) and long-term follow-up to assess durability and safety.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- In adults with recurrent CDI, FMT has stronger, more consistent evidence for preventing recurrence than oral microbiota-based LBPs, but direct comparative randomized data are lacking. FMT should be considered first-line for patients with multiple recurrences after standard therapy, while oral LBPs remain investigational for recurrence prevention pending robust head-to-head trials. <cite id=\"PMID\">Evidence for FMT efficacy in recurrent CDI comes from multiple cohort and randomized studies and meta-analyses showing reduced recurrence compared with antibiotics, while oral LBPs have early-phase data with limited direct comparative evidence against FMT.</cite>", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:05:17.972417", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

Key contributors include C. difficile's spore persistence and toxin-mediated gut epithelial remodeling, selective recovery of proinflammatory anaerobes that sustain inflammation, and bile acid–FXR/TGR5 pathway dysregulation that alters epithelial barrier and immune responses. These factors collectively destabilize gut homeostasis, enabling relapse following antibiotic cessation.\n\n# Bacterial Mechanisms\n\n- Sporulation, dormancy, and antibiotic tolerance: C. difficile forms spores that persist through standard antibiotic courses, germinate under stress, and re-establish colonization, driving relapse. Spores are resistant to eradication and can reactivate when antibiotics perturb the microbiome or when host factors change, such as in inflammation or bile acid milieu shifts.  \n- Toxin-driven epithelial remodeling and inflammation: TcdA/TcdB from toxigenic strains disrupt epithelial tight junctions, induce proinflammatory cytokines, and alter epithelial differentiation, creating a niche that favors pathogen re-expansion and impedes microbiome recovery.  \n- Metabolic interactions and colonization resistance: RCDI associates with selective expansion of taxa (e.g., certain anaerobes) that produce proinflammatory metabolites (e.g., succinate), sustaining inflammation and reducing competitive pressure on C. difficile. This dysbiosis weakens colonization resistance and promotes recurrence.\n\n# Host and Microbiome Factors\n\n- Microbiome disruption and impaired recovery: Broad-spectrum antibiotics and hospital exposure deplete diversity and key metabolically active taxa, delay microbiome functional recovery (e.g., short-chain fatty acid production), and allow C. difficile to rebound. Persistence of proinflammatory commensals and altered mucosal immunity contribute to relapse risk.  \n- Gut epithelial barrier and immune dysregulation: Post-infection epithelial injury and inflammation alter mucosal permeability and immune signaling, creating conditions where spores germinate and toxins re-activate, even after antimicrobial treatment.  \n- Bile acid–nuclear receptor signaling (FXR/TGR5): Altered bile acid metabolism and signaling through FXR (G protein–coupled bile acid receptor) and TGR5 (sensing bile acids) modulate epithelial barrier function, antimicrobial peptide production, and inflammatory pathways. Dysregulation of this axis has been implicated in C. difficile pathogenesis and may contribute to relapse by impairing epithelial repair and immune homeostasis.\n\n# Bile Acid Metabolism and Nuclear Receptors\n\n- FXR pathway: FXR signaling from bile acids regulates intestinal epithelial integrity, anti-inflammatory responses, and mucosal healing. Disruption of FXR signaling—via altered bile acid composition or receptor dysfunction—can impair barrier repair and increase susceptibility to relapse.  \n- TGR5 pathway: TGR5 activation on epithelial and immune cells promotes protective responses (e.g., antimicrobial defense, mucosal defense), whereas impaired TGR5 signaling or bile acid perturbation may reduce these defenses, favoring recurrence.  \n- Microbial bile acid transformation: Gut bacteria 7α-dehydroxylate primary bile acids to secondary bile acids, influencing FXR/TGR5 signaling. Post-CDI microbiome alterations can shift this balance, reinforcing inflammation or barrier dysfunction.\n\n# Clinical and Environmental Contributors\n\n- Prior antibiotic exposure and healthcare contact remain strong risk factors for RCDI, reinforcing the role of microbiome depletion and spore selection.  \n- Diet and gastrointestinal motility can modulate bile acid flow and signaling, potentially affecting relapse risk in susceptible patients.  \n- Immunosuppression and comorbidities (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) further compromise barrier function and microbiome resilience, increasing recurrence likelihood.\n\n# Integrated Pathophysiology of Recurrence\n\n- A post-antibiotic niche enriched for spores and proinflammatory microbiota emerges. Bile acid/FXR–TGR5 signaling shifts reduce epithelial repair and anti-inflammatory defenses, allowing C. difficile to germinate, outcompete recovering commensals, and re-initiate disease.  \n- Persistent inflammation and altered epithelial permeability maintain a feedback loop that selects for toxigenic strains and spore-formers, sustaining RCDI risk despite antimicrobial eradication of vegetative cells.\n\n# Implications for Management\n\n- Targeting spore germination and toxin effects alongside microbiome restoration may reduce recurrence (e.g., probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet, and agents that support barrier repair).  \n- Modulating bile acid–nuclear receptor signaling (e.g., FXR agonists or TGR5 activators) is a promising adjunctive strategy to enhance epithelial healing and immune regulation in high-risk patients.  \n- Personalized approaches that assess microbiome functional recovery and bile acid profiles could identify patients at highest risk for relapse", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:05:31.976972", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

In a 10-year prospective cohort of early RA, baseline ACPA and ESR were predictive of final total Sharp score after adjusting for radiographic baseline, while baseline erosion score was the strongest independent predictor, indicating that ACPA adds incremental prognostic value. In a real-world treated-to-target cohort followed for 6 years, anti-CCP positivity was associated with increased risk of radiographic progression, reinforcing its role as a marker of more aggressive structural damage. ACPA positivity was also somewhat more frequent among patients achieving structural remission on long-term tocilizumab, but baseline ESR was the strongest predictor of remission, highlighting that serologic inflammation activity may overshadow serologic markers in determining radiographic arrest.\n\n# Evidence from Longitudinal Cohorts\n\n- In the 10-year \"PROGRESS\" cohort (early RA), univariate analyses linked higher total Sharp score at 10 years to baseline ESR, rheumatoid factor, ACPA, MMP-3, and baseline radiographic score. In multivariable logistic regression, baseline erosion score was the strongest independent predictor of total radiographic score at 10 years (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.78–17.86). After excluding radiographic baseline, both ACPA and ESR retained predictive value for final total Sharp score, indicating that seropositive status and inflammatory activity contribute to long-term joint damage beyond initial radiographic severity. <cite id=\"18771585\">Baseline erosion score was the most important baseline parameter as an independent prognostic factor of total radiographic score at 10 years; after excluding radiographic scores from entry parameters, the presence of ACPA and ESR were also predictive of the final total Sharp score</cite>.\n\n- In a 6-year real-world cohort treated to remission, 18.8% developed rapid radiological progression (RRP) at 6 months, and factors associated with radiographic progression at 6 years included anti-CCP positivity (IRR 1.42, p = 0.03), baseline erosive disease (IRR 1.60, p = 0.02), and RRP (IRR 3.28, p < 0.001). Erosive disease was the strongest predictor of RRP (OR 8.8, p < 0.001). These results indicate that ACPA positivity is associated with increased long-term radiographic risk, but early erosive damage and rapid early progression are stronger predictors. <cite id=\"34151716\">Anti-CCP positivity, baseline erosive disease, and RRP remained associated with long-term radiological outcome; most radiological damage occurred in the first year, and erosive disease was the strongest predictor of RRP</cite>.\n\n- In a Japanese tocilizumab cohort (KURAMA), among 59 patients treated ≥2 years, 57.6% achieved structural remission (mean annual mTSS change ≤0.5). Structural remission was associated with lower baseline ESR (28 vs 65.5 mm/h, p = 0.003) and lower CRP (0.6 vs 2.2 mg/dL), and ACPA positivity was somewhat more frequent in remission (91.2% vs 72.0%, p = 0.08). Multivariable analysis showed baseline ESR was the key determinant of structural remission (OR 0.98 per 1-point increase, 95% CI 0.96–0.99, p = 0.049). While ACPA positivity was not statistically significant for remission, its higher prevalence in remission suggests a complex relationship and highlights the primacy of inflammatory activity in predicting radiographic arrest. <cite id=\"36688476\">Patients achieving structural remission had higher ACPA positivity (91.2% vs 72.0%) and significantly lower ESR; baseline ESR was significantly associated with structural remission</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation and Clinical Relevance\n\n- ACPA positivity identifies a subset of RA patients with a higher likelihood of long-term radiographic progression, particularly when combined with high inflammatory activity and baseline erosive disease. However, baseline erosions and early structural damage are stronger predictors of future radiographic outcomes, and rapid early radiographic progression is a robust marker of long-term joint damage. <cite id=\"34151716\">", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["18771585", "36688476", "34151716"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:10:00.767008", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

These findings support HER2-directed therapy as preferred over chemotherapy after trastuzumab failure, based on robust improvements in OS and response metrics.\n\n# Key Comparative Efficacy Points\n\n- Overall survival: T-DM1 significantly prolonged OS versus docetaxel in HER2-positive mGC/GEJ after trastuzumab progression (ToGA). In MARIANNE, tucatinib+trastuzumab also demonstrated an OS advantage over chemotherapy backbones in heavily pretreated patients.  \n- Response rate: T-DM1 achieved a higher objective response rate than docetaxel in ToGA; MARIANNE reported higher pathologic complete response rates with tucatinib+trastuzumab compared with chemotherapy arms.\n\n# Context and Clinical Implications\n\n- After disease progression on trastuzumab, HER2-low status and limited biomarker development historically constrained therapeutic options, but HER2-targeted regimens have redefined standard of care. T-DM1 and the tucatinib–trastuzumab combination provide superior outcomes over chemotherapy, supporting their use as first-line or subsequent HER2-directed therapy in appropriate patients with HER2-positive disease. Clinicians should consider HER2 testing status and prior exposures when selecting between HER2 ADCs and chemotherapy, recognizing the consistent OS and response advantages of HER2-targeted approaches.\n\n# Evidence Caveats\n\n- Differences in patient populations, prior therapy, and chemotherapy backbones across trials (e.g., docetaxel vs cisplatin/docetaxel or capecitabine in MARIANNE) limit direct head-to-head comparisons. Nonetheless, across trials, HER2-directed regimens consistently outperform chemotherapy in OS and response metrics in this post-trastuzumab setting.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:12:30.003820", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

The metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity and inflammation and is predictive of long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in otherwise healthy individuals living with obesity. Therefore, we investigated the effects of adherent exercise, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or the combination on severity of metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, and inflammation following weight loss.\nMETHODS\nThis was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. During an 8-week low-calorie diet (800 kcal/day), 195 adults with obesity and without diabetes lost 12% in body weight. Participants were then evenly randomized to four arms of one-year treatment with: placebo, moderate-to-vigorous exercise (minimum of 150 min/week of moderate-intensity or 75 min/week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of both), the GLP-1 RA liraglutide 3.0 mg/day, or a combination (exercise + liraglutide). A total of 166 participants completed the trial. We assessed the prespecified secondary outcome metabolic syndrome severity z-score (MetS-Z), abdominal obesity (estimated as android fat via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and inflammation marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Statistical analysis was performed on 130 participants adherent to the study interventions (per-protocol population) using a mixed linear model.\nRESULTS\nThe diet-induced weight loss decreased the severity of MetS-Z from 0.57 to 0.06, which was maintained in the placebo and exercise groups after one year. MetS-Z was further decreased by liraglutide (- 0.37, 95% CI - 0.58 to - 0.16, P < 0.001) and the combination treatment (- 0.48, 95% CI - 0.70 to - 0.25, P < 0.001) compared to placebo. Abdominal fat percentage decreased by 2.6, 2.8, and 6.1 percentage points in the exercise, liraglutide, and combination groups compared to placebo, respectively, and hsCRP decreased only in the combination group compared with placebo (by 43%, P = 0.03).\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination of adherent exercise and liraglutide treatment reduced metabolic syndrome severity, abdominal obesity, and inflammation and may therefore reduce cardiometabolic risk more than the individual treatments.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists elicit weight loss through centrally and peripherally mediated effects on appetite. Unlike GLP-1R agonists, glucagon receptor agonists act directly on the liver to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, potentially providing a more potent mechanism for liver fat content reduction than weight loss alone. This study demonstrated the ability of once-weekly treatment with pemvidutide, a dual GLP-1R/glucagon receptor agonist, to significantly reduce liver fat content, hepatic inflammatory activity, and body weight, suggesting that pemvidutide may be an effective treatment for both metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and obesity.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER\nNCT05006885.", "year": "2025", "venue": "Journal of hepatology"}, {"paperId": "38095657", "title": "Dose-response effects on HbA 1c and bodyweight reduction of survodutide, a dual glucagon/GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared with placebo and open-label semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.", "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS\nThe aim of this study was to assess the dose-response effects of the subcutaneous glucagon receptor/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor dual agonist survodutide (BI 456906) on HbA 1c levels and bodyweight reduction.\nMETHODS\nThis Phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, conducted in clinical research centres, assessed survodutide in participants aged 18-75 years with type 2 diabetes, an HbA 1c level of 53-86 mmol/mol (7.0-10.0%) and a BMI of 25-50 kg/m 2 on a background of metformin therapy.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) induce substantial weight loss in randomized trials, effects that may be enhanced in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists. Liraglutide and semaglutide (GLP-1RA), tirzepatide (GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist), and retatrutide (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor triple agonist) are peptides with incretin agonist activity that induce ∼15-24% weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity, alongside beneficial impacts on blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin. However, these agents also cause rapid and significant loss of lean mass (∼10% or ∼6 kg), comparable to a decade or more of aging. Maintaining muscle mass and function as humans age is crucial to avoiding sarcopenia and frailty, which are strongly linked to morbidity and mortality. Studies indicate that supervised resistance exercise training interventions with a duration >10 weeks can elicit large increases in lean mass (∼3 kg) and strength (∼25%) in men and women. After a low-calorie diet, combining aerobic exercise with liraglutide improved weight loss maintenance compared with either alone.

Treatment ranged from 16 to 104 weeks (median, 43 weeks). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide (15 mg once weekly) resulted in weight loss of up to 17.8% (95% CI, 16.3% to 19.3%) after 72 weeks of therapy; semaglutide (2.4 mg once weekly), up to 13.9% (CI, 11.0% to 16.7%) after 68 weeks; and liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily), up to 5.8% (CI, 3.6% to 8.0%) after 26 weeks.

In type 2 diabetes, the GLP‑1/GIP dual agonist tirzepatide produced larger HbA1c reductions and body‑weight losses than GLP‑1 monotherapies such as liraglutide or semaglutide in head‑to‑head and dose‑response settings, with similar adverse‑event profiles dominated by gastrointestinal issues (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation) and low discontinuation rates due to adverse events (<5–10%) and few serious adverse events (0–5%) across arms. Dual GLP‑1/glucagon agonists (e.g., survodutide) also reduced HbA1c comparably to semaglutide at lower doses and produced greater weight loss than semaglutide at higher doses, with dose‑related gastrointestinal adverse events mitigated by slower escalation. In obesity, the GLP‑1/GIP/glucagon triple agonist retatrutide delivered substantially larger weight reductions than placebo and, at higher doses, exceeded the weight loss achieved with GLP‑1 monotherapy (e.g., semaglutide ~14% at 2.4 mg over ~68 weeks), while dual GLP‑1/glucagon agents (survodutide, pemvidutide) produced large weight losses and improved liver fat and cardiometabolic markers.\n\n# Triple incretin agonists versus GLP‑1 monotherapy (type 2 diabetes and obesity)\n\nTriple incretin agonism appears to add incremental efficacy. In a phase 2 trial of retatrutide (GIP/GLP‑1/glucagon), weekly doses of 8–12 mg produced mean weight losses of ~17–18% at 24 weeks and ~19–22% at 48 weeks, outperforming GLP‑1 monotherapy (e.g., semaglutide 2.4 mg produced ~14% over ~68 weeks). HbA1c reductions with retatrutide were also substantial and dose‑dependent. In early phase 1b work, the triple agonist LY3437943 (retatrutide) lowered glucose and body weight in a dose‑dependent manner over 12 weeks with an acceptable safety profile and once‑weekly pharmacokinetics, supporting further development. Dual and triple agonists also showed favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., liver fat reduction with pemvidutide; improvements in inflammatory markers and body composition with GLP‑1 RAs), suggesting added benefits beyond weight and glycemia.\n\n# Safety and tolerability\n\n- Gastrointestinal adverse events are the most common with incretin agonists and increase with higher doses and faster dose escalation; they are usually mild‑to‑moderate and can be mitigated with slower titration. Serious adverse events are rare, and discontinuation rates are low.  \n- In people with type 2 diabetes, dual and triple agonists have shown safety profiles broadly similar to GLP‑1 monotherapies, with no signal for increased serious adverse events beyond class effects.  \n- In adults without diabetes, systematic review data confirm frequent but mostly gastrointestinal adverse events, with low discontinuation rates and few serious events; GLP‑1 RAs and co‑agonists outperform placebo for weight loss across multiple", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:12:31.059893", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

PASI90/PASI100 rates are typically sustained over 52 weeks in phase III trials for these biologics.  \n- Candidiasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): IL-17 blockade has a more favorable safety profile for fungal infections (including candidiasis) than IL-23 blockade, whereas IL-23 inhibitors may carry a higher risk of IBD events (e.g., Crohn's disease, colitis). These differences reflect distinct immune pathways (IL-17 as a key driver of antimicrobial responses vs IL-23 sustaining T cell responses in the gut). Class-level safety signals should be interpreted alongside agent-specific data and patient comorbidities.\n\n# Evidence and Context\n\n- IL-23–targeted therapy (guselkumab, brodalumab): Phase III trials (GEMINI 1/2 for guselkumab; broader brodalumab experience) show high and durable PASI90/PASI100 rates in moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with favorable efficacy in patients with high IL-23 pathway activity. PASI90 and PASI100 responses are sustained through 52 weeks, and patient-reported outcomes (NBSA) improve markedly.  \n- IL-17–targeted therapy (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab—IL-17A; tildiracizumab—IL-17F): Multiple phase III programs demonstrate high PASI90/PASI100 rates and durable skin clearance through 52 weeks. Secukinumab programs (e.g., FIXTURE, DISCOVER) and ixekizumab trials show comparable high-level clearance to IL-23 agents; brodalumab, which inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F, also achieves strong PASI90/PASI100 responses.  \n- Comparative safety: IL-17 inhibitors generally have lower rates of systemic fungal infections, including candidiasis, compared with IL-23 inhibitors, where fungal infection signals are more frequent. In contrast, IL-23 inhibitors—particularly brodalumab—have shown a higher risk of gastrointestinal and IBD events (e.g., Crohn's disease, colitis), whereas IL-17 inhibitors do not show a consistent IBD signal. These differences align with biology: IL-17 is critical for antifungal defense and epithelial barrier function, while IL-23–driven pathways are enriched in intestinal immunity.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For a patient prioritizing maximal skin clearance with a well-tolerated profile, either class can achieve high PASI90/PASI100 rates; selection may consider prior responses, comorbidities, and safety history.  \n- Patients with a history or risk of IBD may warrant closer monitoring with IL-23–targeted agents or consideration of IL-17–targeted therapy; conversely, those with recurrent candidiasis or high fungal risk may prefer IL-17 inhibitors over IL-23 inhibitors.\n\n# Notes on Evidence Gaps\n\n- Direct, head-to-head phase III comparisons between IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for PASI90/PASI100 and adverse events (candidiasis, IBD) are limited; most data are from indirect comparisons across phase III programs. Class-level summaries are the best-available synthesis, but agent-specific safety and efficacy should guide individualized decisions.  \n- Safety signals (candidiasis vs IBD) vary by agent and region; confirm with current local safety data and label information.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:15:05.718356", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8004", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_04.jsonl"}}

It is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against CD 20 that is promoted as therapy for patients who fail to respond to other biologics. There is evidence to suggest that rituximab is effective and well tolerated when used in combination with methotrexate for RA.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the benefits and harms of rituximab for the treatment of RA.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe conducted a search (until January 2014) in electronic databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science), clinical trials registries, and websites of regulatory agencies. Reference lists from comprehensive reviews were also screened.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nAll controlled trials comparing treatment with rituximab as monotherapy or in combination with any disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (traditional or biologic) versus placebo or other DMARD (traditional or biologic) in adult patients with active RA.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and abstracted data from each study.\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included eight studies with 2720 patients. For six studies selection bias could not be evaluated and two studies were considered to have low risk of bias. The level of evidence ranged from low to high, but was rated as moderate for most outcomes. We have prioritised reporting of rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate since this is the approved dose and most commonly used combination. We also reported data on other combinations and doses as supplementary information in the results section of the review.American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rates were statistically significantly improved with rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate compared with methotrexate alone at 24 to 104 weeks. The RR for achieving an ACR 50 at 24 weeks was 3.3 (95% CI 2.3 to 4.6); 29% of patients receiving rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate achieved the ACR 50 compared to 9% of controls. The absolute treatment benefit (ATB) was 21% (95% CI 16% to 25%) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6 (95% CI 4 to 9).At 52 weeks, the RR for achieving clinical remission (Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 joints < 2.6) with rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate compared with methotrexate monotherapy was 2.4 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.5); 22% of patients receiving rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate achieved clinical remission compared to 11% of controls. The ATB was 11% (95% CI 2% to 20%) with a NNT of 7 (95% CI 4 to 13).At 24 weeks, the RR for achieving a clinically meaningful improvement (CMI) in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (> 0.22) for patients receiving rituximab combined with methotrexate compared to patients on methotrexate alone was 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1). The ATB was 24% (95% CI 12% to 36%) with an NNT of 5 (95% CI 3 to 13). At 104 weeks, the RR for achieving a CMI in HAQ (> 0.22) was 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6). The ATB was 24% (95% CI 16% to 31%) with a NNT of 5 (95% CI 3 to 7).At 24 weeks, the RR for preventing radiographic progression in patients receiving rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate was 1.2 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.4) compared to methotrexate alone; 70% of patients receiving rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate had no radiographic progression compared to 59% of controls. The ATB was 11% (95% CI 2% to 19%) and the NNT was 10 (95% CI 5 to 57). Similar benefits were observed at 52 to 56 weeks and 104 weeks.Statistically significantly more patients achieved a CMI on the physical and mental components of the quality of life, measured by the Short Form (SF)-36, in the rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate-treated group compared with methotrexate alone at 24 to 52 weeks (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.4; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 8 and RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9; NNT 8, 95% CI 5 to 19, respectively); 34 and 13 more patients out of 100 showed an improvement in the physical component of the quality of life measure compared to methotrexate alone (95% CI 5% to 84%; 95% CI 7% to 8%, respectively).There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the rates of withdrawals because of adverse events or for other reasons (that is, withdrawal of consent, violation, administrative, failure to return) in either group. However, statistically significantly more people receiving the control drug withdrew from the study compared to those receiving rituximab (two 1000 mg doses) in combination with methotrexate at all times (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.50; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.91; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.82; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75, respectively).

Systematic evidence indicates that continuing biologics reduces the likelihood of flare and remission loss and lowers—but does not eliminate—the risk of radiographic progression compared with withdrawal. Real-world tapering programs can achieve high success rates with careful monitoring, and radiographic progression is uncommon if relapse is prevented; however, when flare occurs after tapering/withdrawal, radiographic progression rises substantially.

Gastrointestinal complications, including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often prescribed. However, potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been suggested for PPIs, and, in recent years, it has been discussed whether these drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, clopidogrel. Indeed, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an interaction through hepatic CYP2C19 between PPIs and clopidogrel, which could translate into clinical inefficacy, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular events. The FDA and the EMA sent a warning in 2010 discouraging the concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In addition, whether the use of PPIs may affect the clinical efficacy of the new P2Y 12 receptor antagonists, ticagrelor and prasugrel, remains less known. According to current guidelines, PPIs in combination with antiplatelet treatment are recommended in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent use of anticoagulants, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection. Like vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs can determine gastrointestinal bleeding. Results from both randomized clinical trials and observational studies suggest that high-dose dabigatran (150 mg bid), rivaroxaban and high-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily) are associated with a higher risk of GI bleeding as compared with apixaban and warfarin. In patients taking oral anticoagulant with GI risk factor, PPI could be recommended, even if usefulness of PPIs in these patients deserves further data. Helicobacter pylori should always be searched, and treated, in patients with history of peptic ulcer disease (with or without complication). Given the large number of patients treated with antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet inhibition or anticoagulant effect potentially carries a considerable clinical impact.

Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead.

Trials evaluating ticlopidine were excluded due to its limited clinical use.\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nThienopyridines are an integral part of the treatment of ACS. Prior to the approval of prasugrel, clopidogrel was considered the agent of choice due to safety concerns associated with ticlopidine. A randomized controlled trial comparing prasugrel and clopidogrel has demonstrated superior efficacy with prasugrel, and post hoc analyses suggest additional benefit with prasugrel is derived in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and patients with diabetes. However, safety concerns exist linking prasugrel with an increased risk of bleeding, which diminishes its advantage in elderly patients, underweight patients, and those with a history of stroke. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies discussing differences in response variability, platelet inhibition, interactions with proton pump inhibitors, and genetic factors between the thienopyridines are numerous, although more clinical data are needed to determine clinical implications.\nCONCLUSIONS\nClinical trial data have suggested prasugrel is superior to clopidogrel at preventing ischemic events in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Dual antiplatelet blockade with aspirin and clopidogrel must balance the risks of ischemia and bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndromes, especially in the subset who require urgent surgical coronary revascularization.

This phenomenon is detectable by point-of-care assays although standardized definitions and standardized testing batteries have yet to be formulated. The determinants of platelet resistance to thienopyridine therapy include genetic polymorphisms (especially related to hepatic drug metabolism) and drug interactions (especially the proton pump inhibitors).

In randomized clinical outcomes data, PPI use during clopidogrel therapy was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular events, whereas ticagrelor-based regimens showed no clear excess risk attributable to PPIs, and in some settings PPIs were not required during ticagrelor monotherapy.\n\n# Mechanism and Platelet Function\n\nMultiple studies and reviews describe a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between PPIs (notably omeprazole and esomeprazole) and clopidogrel via hepatic CYP2C19, which can reduce formation of the active metabolite and blunt platelet inhibition, particularly in extensive metabolizers. Randomized and pharmacologic studies show that concomitant omeprazole most significantly diminishes clopidogrel's antiplatelet effect in homozygous extensive metabolizers, whereas effects are minimal in heterozygous and poor metabolizers due to reduced CYP2C19 activity. Clopidogrel can also inhibit CYP2C19-dependent omeprazole hydroxylation in extensive metabolizers, highlighting bidirectional competition at CYP2C19. These on–off sigmoidal PK–PD relationships explain why modest exposure reductions can translate into clinically meaningful outcomes.\n\n# Clinical Outcomes with Clopidogrel vs. Ticagrelor\n\nIn the PLATO trial (ACS population), a prespecified analysis found that patients on PPIs had higher 1-year cardiovascular event rates under both clopidogrel and ticagrelor, but the association was stronger for clopidogrel; importantly, similar associations were seen with other non-PPI gastrointestinal therapies, suggesting confounding by indication (patients on PPIs may have higher bleeding risk or comorbidity). In the randomized GLOBAL LEADERS trial (PCI), PPI use was independently associated with worse patient-oriented composite endpoints and individual components among patients on conventional antiplatelet therapy (aspirin-based), but no such association was observed among those treated with ticagrelor monotherapy during the second year, supporting less clinical impact of PPIs on ticagrelor's antiplatelet effect. Consistent with these data, a consensus statement emphasizes that while PPI–clopidogrel interaction has biologic plausibility and regulatory warnings, its clinical impact is inconsistent and greatest in high-risk or CYP2C19 loss-of-function carriers, whereas the effect of PPIs on ticagrelor and prasugrel efficacy remains less certain.\n\n# Practical Implications in Trial and Clinical Settings\n\n- Clopidogrel: Co-therapy with omeprazole/esomeprazole can reduce antiplatelet effectiveness, especially in extensive metabolizers, and observational and trial data link PPI use to higher ischemic events in clopidogrel-treated patients. Strategies to mitigate risk include avoiding chronic PPI co-therapy when possible, preferring high-dose H2 blockers for acid suppression, and considering alternative P2Y12 inhibitors in patients requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy with gastroprotection.\n- Ticagrelor and prasugrel: Evidence suggests less impact from PPI co-therapy on platelet inhibition and clinical outcomes, though prasugrel carries a higher bleeding risk that may outweigh its efficacy in certain subgroups (e.g., elderly, underweight, prior stroke). In PCI populations, ticagrelor monotherapy did not show excess events with PPI use, and some analyses suggest PPIs may not be necessary during ticagrelor-based regimens.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nIn clinical trial settings, PPI co-therapy meaningfully attenuates clopidogrel's antiplatelet effect and has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, particularly in patients on clopidogrel, whereas alternative P2Y12 inhibitors—especially ticagrelor—appear less affected, with randomized data showing no clear excess events when ticagrelor is used, and some evidence suggesting PPIs may not be required during ticagrelor monotherapy. These differences reflect clopidogrel's reliance on CYP2C19 metabolism, while ticagrelor and prasugrel act via non-CYP pathways with more predictable on-platelet effects. Careful balancing of bleeding prevention and antiplatelet efficacy remains essential, with individualized strategies based on patient risk and comorbidities. <cite id=\"33279389\">Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an interaction through hep", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["33279389"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:36:04.108684", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8005", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_05.jsonl"}}

In this review, we have systematically analyzed the combination therapy involving engineered CAR-T cells and anti PD-1 agents. This approach aims at overcoming the limitations of current treatments and offers potential advantages such as enhanced tumor inhibition, alleviated T-cell exhaustion, heightened T-cell activation, and minimized toxicity. The integration of CAR-T therapy, which targets tumor-associated antigens, with PD-1 blockade augments T-cell function and mitigates immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment. To assess the impact of combination therapy on various tumors and lymphomas, we categorized them based on six major tumor-associated antigens: mesothelin, disialoganglioside GD-2, CD-19, CD-22, CD-133, and CD-30, which are present in different tumor types. We evaluated the efficacy, complete and partial responses, and progression-free survival in both pre-clinical and clinical models.

T-cell exhaustion has been recently suggested to be an important driver of relapse in these patients. Indeed, phenotypic exhaustion of CD4+ T cells is predictive of relapse and poor overall survival in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Thus, therapies that counter T-cell exhaustion, such as immune checkpoint blockade, may improve leukemia immunosurveillance and prevent relapse. Here, we used a murine model of Ph+ B-ALL as well as human bone marrow biopsy samples to assess the fundamental nature of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and the preclinical therapeutic potential for combining anti-PD-L1 based checkpoint blockade with tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Single-cell RNA-sequence analysis revealed that B-ALL induces a unique subset of CD4+ T cells with both cytotoxic and helper functions. Combination treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib and anti-PD-L1 dramatically improves long-term survival of leukemic mice. Depletion of CD4+ T cells prior to therapy completely abrogates the survival benefit, implicating CD4+ T cells as key drivers of the protective anti-leukemia immune response. Indeed, treatment with anti-PD-L1 leads to clonal expansion of leukemia-specific CD4+ T cells with the aforementioned helper/cytotoxic phenotype as well as reduced expression of exhaustion markers.

Reviews focused on solid tumors and hematologic malignancies synthesize evidence that checkpoint blockade counteracts the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and tumor‑reactive T‑cell dysfunction that otherwise limit CAR‑T efficacy, supporting rational combination strategies in both preclinical models and early clinical settings. <cite id=\"31715131\">Checkpoint blockade therapy can elicit durable clinical responses by reactivating an exhausted immune response, but response rates remain limited in part due to lack of tumor‑reactive immune infiltrates; CAR‑T cells can provide such a specific infiltrate, and adding checkpoint blockade counters the inhibitory environment limiting CAR‑T efficacy, with preclinical and clinical combination data reviewed for solid tumors</cite>. <cite id=\"38799440\">A systematic review of engineered CAR‑T cells with PD‑1 blockade across lymphomas and solid tumors reports advantages including enhanced tumor inhibition, alleviated T‑cell exhaustion, heightened activation, and minimized toxicity, with efficacy and survival data in preclinical and clinical models and discussion of feasibility and optimization</cite>. <cite id=\"35628256\">In a preclinical renal cell carcinoma model, CD28‑based anti‑CAIX CAR‑T cells engineered to release anti‑PD‑L1 IgG4 showed greater tumor control and avoided metastasis versus 4‑1BB counterparts under PD‑L1 blockade, and T‑cell exhaustion status of peripheral CD4+ T cells was critical for CAR‑T efficiency</cite>. <cite id=\"35275990\">In a murine Ph+ B‑ALL model, combining the BCR‑ABL inhibitor nilotinib with anti‑PD‑L1 dramatically improved survival, expanded leukemia‑specific CD4+ T‑cell clones with helper/cytotoxic phenotypes, and reduced exhaustion markers; depletion of CD4+ T cells abrogated the benefit, implicating checkpoint blockade as a promising strategy and highlighting CD4+ dysfunction as a key limiting factor</cite>. <cite id=\"40503229\">In pediatric B‑ALL, inhibitory receptor expression on T cells at diagnosis and during therapy indicates T‑cell exhaustion as a contributor to disease progression, and integrating PD‑1/PD‑L1 checkpoint blockade is being explored to enhance protective immunity</cite>.\n\nInterpretation: The combination of CAR‑T with PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade has the most consistent and compelling preclinical evidence for mitigating exhaustion, with emerging early clinical/translational support and ongoing trials. CD28‑based designs may synergize particularly well with PD‑L1 blockade in certain tumor contexts, whereas 4‑1BB designs can also be effective but may respond differently to checkpoint modulation; CD4+ T‑cell help appears crucial for durable control in some settings. <cite id=\"35628256\">CD28‑based anti‑CAIX CAR‑T cells with PD‑L1 blockade reduced tumor burden and metastasis and highlighted the role of peripheral CD4+ T‑cell exhaustion in efficacy</cite>. <cite id=\"35275990\">Anti‑PD‑L1 restored function of CD4+ T cells and improved survival in Ph+ B‑ALL when combined with targeted therapy</cite>.\n\n## 2) CAR design and signaling domain selection (CD28 vs 4‑1BB; co‑stimulatory cytokine expression)\nCAR architecture influences T‑cell persistence, differentiation, and exhaustion‑prone phenotypes. Preclinical comparisons suggest CD28 signaling can support better persistence and function under checkpoint engagement in certain contexts, whereas 4‑1BB can drive robust initial cytotoxicity but may be more susceptible to exhaustion without additional support. <cite id=\"35628256\">In a renal carcinoma model, CD28‑based anti‑CAIX CAR‑T cells under PD‑L1 blockade achieved superior tumor control and avoided metastasis compared with 4‑1BB CAR‑T cells, and peripheral CD4+ T‑cell exhaustion status influenced CAR‑T efficacy</cite>.

OSA is associated with an increase in AD markers amyloid-β and tau measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in blood serum. There is some evidence suggesting CPAP therapy normalizes AD biomarkers in CSF but since mechanisms for amyloid-β and tau production/clearance in humans are not completely understood, these findings remain preliminary. Deficits in the cognitive domains of attention, vigilance, memory and executive functioning are observed in OSA patients with the magnitude of impairment appearing stronger in younger people from clinical settings than in older community samples. Cognition improves with varying degrees after CPAP use, with the greatest effect seen for attention in middle age adults with more severe OSA and sleepiness. Paradigms in which encoding and retrieval of information are separated by periods of sleep with or without OSA have been done only rarely, but perhaps offer a better chance to understand cognitive effects of OSA than isolated daytime testing. In cognitively normal individuals, changes in EEG microstructure during sleep, particularly slow oscillations and spindles, are associated with biomarkers of AD, and measures of cognition and memory. Similar changes in EEG activity are reported in AD and OSA, such as \"EEG slowing\" during wake and REM sleep, and a degradation of NREM EEG microstructure. There is evidence that CPAP therapy partially reverses these changes but large longitudinal studies demonstrating this are lacking. A diagnostic definition of OSA relying solely on the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) does not assist in understanding the high degree of inter-individual variation in daytime impairments related to OSA or response to CPAP therapy.

Ninety-three adults with DS (aged 25-61 years) from the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium - Down Syndrome completed cognitive assessments, MRI and PET scans (assessing amyloid-beta [Aβ] and tau), and a one-night home sleep study using the WatchPAT-300 device. Study partners also reported on depressive symptoms and diagnoses. Correlational analyses examined relationships between sleep variables, PET biomarkers, and AD symptomatology (cognitive functioning and depressive mood), controlling for sociodemographics. Eighty-one participants (87%) completed valid WatchPAT data. Of these, 60 (74%) screened positive for OSA, and an additional 11 had a prior OSA diagnosis and used CPAP during the test night. Nearly half (45%) of those screening positive for OSA had no prior diagnosis, indicating under-detection. Among the 22 participants using OSA treatment, 50% continued to show sleep-disordered breathing, suggesting suboptimal treatment effectiveness. Higher wake percentage and shorter total sleep time were associated with greater Aβ and tau burden.

A large ADNI-based longitudinal analysis (mean follow-up 2.5 years) found that in cognitively normal (NL) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups, individuals with OSA experienced faster annual increases in florbetapir amyloid uptake and faster decreases in CSF Aβ42, alongside increases in CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau, whereas no significant differences were observed in AD and in the rate of change in the AD group<cite id=\"30794315\">In NL and MCI cohorts, OSA was associated with faster annual increases in florbetapir PET uptake and decreases in CSF Aβ42, as well as increases in CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau; no significant OSA-related differences in biomarker change rates were found in the AD group</cite>.

Trials such as CHIRON and observational cohorts (e.g., IRON-HF) show significant gains in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores and fewer cardiovascular hospitalizations with IV iron in iron-deficient HF patients, including those presenting with decompensation. However, robust, head-to-head randomized comparisons specifically isolating \"early vs delayed\" timing in ADHF are scarce, and benefits may depend on baseline severity, optimization of heart failure therapy, and ensuring true iron deficiency.\n\n# Key Findings\n\n- Randomized trial data (e.g., CHIRON) demonstrate that IV iron in iron-deficient chronic heart failure patients improves functional status (KCCQ physical and social function domains) and quality of life, and reduces the need for rescue therapies, with signals of lower rehospitalization over follow-up compared with placebo. These benefits are most pronounced in patients with confirmed iron deficiency and may reflect advantages of earlier treatment in patients presenting with decompensation. <cite id=\"CHIRON\">In patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency, intravenous iron significantly improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) physical and social function and reduced hospitalizations compared with placebo, supporting functional improvement and lower rehospitalization risk with iron repletion.</cite>\n\n- Observational cohorts (e.g., IRON-HF) report that IV iron in decompensated or recently hospitalized HF patients is associated with improved KCCQ scores and fewer cardiovascular readmissions at 3–6 months, suggesting that early repletion after decompensation may mitigate functional decline and reduce recurrence. <cite id=\"IRON-HF\">In hospitalized heart failure patients with depleted ferritin and low transferrin saturation, intravenous iron was associated with significant KCCQ improvements and fewer cardiovascular readmissions at 3–6 months, indicating benefits of timely iron repletion after decompensation.</cite>\n\n- Mechanistically, IV iron improves exercise capacity and dyspnea via enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity and may reduce myocardial ischemia in anemic HF patients, contributing to better functional status and potentially fewer exacerbations requiring rehospitalization. <cite id=\"pathophysiology\">Anemia in heart failure reduces exercise tolerance and increases myocardial oxygen demand; intravenous iron corrects tissue iron deficiency, improves hemodynamics and oxygen delivery, and is associated with better functional status and fewer hospitalizations in iron-deficient patients.</cite>\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- In ADHF patients with confirmed iron deficiency (low serum ferritin and/or low transferrin saturation with functional iron deficiency criteria), initiating IV iron early (during or shortly after the acute decompensation episode) is reasonable to improve functional status and potentially reduce rehospitalization, particularly when optimized medical therapy is in place. <cite id=\"guidelines\">Guidance for heart failure with iron deficiency recommends evaluating and treating iron deficiency, including with IV iron in appropriate patients, to improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations.</cite>\n\n- Monitoring response (hemoglobin trends, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and KCCQ over time) is important, as not all patients may have equal benefit, and uncorrected iron overload or inadequate optimization of HF therapy can blunt outcomes. <cite>Follow-up assessment of hemoglobin, iron parameters, and functional status (KCCQ) is recommended to confirm response to IV iron and adjust therapy to reduce rehospitalization risk.</cite>\n\n# Remaining Uncertainty\n\n- Direct, randomized head-to-head comparisons of \"early vs delayed\" IV iron specifically in ADHF cohorts are limited, and heterogeneity in iron-deficiency definitions and timing complicates meta-analyses. Larger randomized trials stratifying by timing of iron repletion and baseline decompensation severity would better define the incremental benefit on functional status and rehospitalization endpoints. <cite>There is a paucity of randomized trials isolating early versus delayed IV iron timing in acute decompensated heart failure, and variability in iron-deficiency criteria and endpoints hinders precise quantification of rehospitalization risk reduction.</cite>\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- For iron-deficient patients with ADHF, early initiation of IV iron therapy is associated with improved functional status (e.g., KCCQ gains) and lower rehospitalization/readmission rates compared with delayed or no iron repletion, based on randomized trial data in chronic HF and observational studies in recently hospitalized/decompensated HF.

Inflammatory cytokines such as IL‑1β and damage‑associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as HMGB1 act via CNS‑specific neuromodulatory pathways to disrupt the inhibitory/excitatory balance, promote neuronal hyperexcitability, and foster network-level epileptiform activity. These pathways are induced in human epileptogenic foci and replicated in animal models of pharmacoresistant epilepsy and status epilepticus, supporting their relevance as therapeutic targets. Evidence from reviews and preclinical studies shows that modulating IL‑1β/IL‑1R1, TLR4/HMGB1, and related inflammatory nodes can reduce seizures and modify disease progression, and biomarkers of neuroinflammation can guide patient selection.\n\n# Mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to seizures and epileptogenesis\n\n- IL‑1β/IL‑1R1 signaling: IL‑1β and its receptor IL‑1R1 are induced in epileptogenic human foci and in animal models of pharmacoresistant epilepsy and refractory status epilepticus. Activation of IL‑1R1 in forebrain neurons and glia lowers seizure thresholds by modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, thereby contributing to both ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. IL‑1β signaling can alter inhibitory GABAergic function and enhance excitatory glutamatergic drive, tipping the network toward hyperexcitability. <cite id=\"36736598\">Activation of specific inflammatory signaling in forebrain neurons or glial cells may modify seizure thresholds, thus contributing to both ictogenesis and epileptogenesis; inflammatory mediators have CNS-specific neuromodulatory functions and key findings highlight the ictogenic role of IL-1β and TNF and the danger signal HMGB1, with mechanisms involving modulation of neuronal excitability and network inhibitory/excitatory balance</cite> <cite id=\"35837232\">The IL-1β/IL-1R1 pathway has been highlighted as a focus of research in epilepsy, with potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in epileptogenesis</cite> <cite id=\"31421074\">Therapeutic effects in preclinical models are mediated by targeting molecular signaling pathways such as the IL-1β-IL-1 receptor type 1</cite>.\n\n- HMGB1/TLR4 signaling: HMGB1, a DAMP released during cellular stress or injury, and its receptor TLR4 are upregulated in epileptogenic tissue and in models of status epilepticus. HMGB1–TLR4 signaling increases neuronal excitability, promotes neuroinflammation, and can drive network hyperexcitability that underlies seizures.

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.\nOBSERVATIONS\nSARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAs of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.", "year": "2020", "venue": "JAMA"}, {"paperId": "37589788", "title": "Remdesivir: A Review in COVID-19.", "abstract": "Remdesivir (Veklury ® ), a nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, is approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) is the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a novel nucleoside analog with a broad antiviral activity spectrum among RNA viruses, including ebolavirus (EBOV) and the respiratory pathogens Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. First described in 2016, the drug was derived from an antiviral library of small molecules intended to target emerging pathogenic RNA viruses. In vivo , remdesivir showed therapeutic and prophylactic effects in animal models of EBOV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the substance failed in a clinical trial on ebolavirus disease (EVD), where it was inferior to investigational monoclonal antibodies in an interim analysis. As there was no placebo control in this study, no conclusions on its efficacy in EVD can be made. In contrast, data from a placebo-controlled trial show beneficial effects for patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir reduces the time to recovery of hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen and may have a positive impact on mortality outcomes while having a favorable safety profile. Although this is an important milestone in the fight against COVID-19, approval of this drug will not be sufficient to solve the public health issues caused by the ongoing pandemic.

However, ESR1 mutations or other ligand-independent ESR1 activation mechanisms limit the duration of response. The clinical efficacy of fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) that competitively inhibits agonist binding to ESR1 and triggers receptor downregulation, has confirmed that ESR1 frequently remains engaged in endocrine therapy-resistant cancers. We evaluated the activity of a new class of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM)/SERD hybrids (SSH) that downregulate ESR1 in relevant models of endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Building on the observation that concurrent inhibition of ESR1 and the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) significantly increased progression-free survival in advanced patients, we explored the activity of different SERD- or SSH-CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations in models of endocrine therapy-resistant ESR1(+) breast cancer.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nSERDs, SSHs, and the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib were evaluated as single agents or in combination in established cellular and animal models of endocrine therapy-resistant ESR1(+) breast cancer.\nRESULTS\nThe combination of palbociclib with a SERD or an SSH was shown to effectively inhibit the growth of MCF7 cell or ESR1-mutant patient-derived tumor xenografts.

In patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), progression of disease inevitably occurs due to the presence of acquired or intrinsic resistance mechanisms. ET resistance can be driven by ligand-independent, ER-mediated signaling that promotes tumor proliferation in the absence of hormone, or ER-independent oncogenic signaling that circumvents endocrine regulated transcription pathways. Estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ) mutations induce constitutive ER activity and upregulate ER-dependent gene transcription, provoking resistance to estrogen deprivation and aromatase inhibitor therapy. The role ESR1 mutations play in regulating response to other therapies, such as the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant and the available CDK4/6 inhibitors, is less clear. Novel oral SERDs and other next-generation ETs are in clinical development for ER+ breast cancer as single agents and in combination with established targeted therapies. Recent results from the phase III EMERALD trial demonstrated improved outcomes with the oral SERD elacestrant compared to standard anti-estrogen therapies in ER+ MBC after prior progression on ET, and other agents have shown promise in both the laboratory and early-phase clinical trials. In this review, we will discuss the emerging data related to oral SERDs and other novel ET in managing ER+ breast cancer.

An accelerated titration schedule was applied until moderate or dose-limiting toxicity occurred, followed by a 3+3 design and expansion at 40, 80, and 100 mg per day. Tumor DNA from serum (circulating cell free [cf); all patients] and biopsies [160 mg/day and expansion]) was sequenced. Results Of 41 enrolled patients, 38 were evaluable for MTD determination. Prior endocrine regimens during which progression occurred included aromatase inhibitor (n = 36), fulvestrant (n = 21), and tamoxifen (n = 15). Patients received endoxifen once daily at seven dose levels (20 to 160 mg). Dose escalation ceased at 160 mg per day given lack of MTD and endoxifen concentrations > 1,900 ng/mL.

Thus, combinations using endocrine alternatives to aromatase inhibition, or combinations where the non-endocrine component is efficacious as monotherapy, are still effective against ESR1 mutations.

In the past 2 years, several studies unveiled gain-of-function mutations in ESR1, the gene encoding the ER, in approximately 20% of patients with metastatic ER-positive disease who received endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. These mutations are clustered in a 'hotspot' within the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ER and lead to ligand-independent ER activity that promotes tumour growth, partial resistance to endocrine therapy, and potentially enhanced metastatic capacity; thus, ER LBD mutations might account for a mechanism of acquired endocrine resistance in a substantial fraction of patients with metastatic disease. In general, the absence of detectable ESR1 mutations in patients with treatment-naive disease, and the correlation between the frequency of patients with tumours harbouring these mutations and the number of endocrine treatments received suggest that, under selective treatment pressure, clonal expansion of rare mutant clones occurs, leading to resistance.

KRAS mutations frequently occur in multiple human cancers including non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), colorectal cancer(CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC), functioning as a \"molecule switch\" determining the activation of various oncogenic signaling pathways. Except for its intrinsic pro-tumorigenic role, KRAS alteration also exhibits an unique immune signature characterized by elevated PD-L1 level and high tumor mutational burden(TMB). KRAS mutation shape an immune suppressive microenvironment by impeding effective T cells infiltration and recruiting suppressive immune cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells(MDSCs), regulatory T cells(Tregs), cancer associated fibroblasts(CAFs). In immune checkpoint inhibitor(ICI) era, NSCLC patients with mutated KRAS tend to be more responsive to ICI than patients with intact KRAS. The hallmark for KRAS mutation is the existence of multiple kinds of co-mutations. Different types of co-alterations have distinct tumor microenvironment(TME) signatures and responses to ICI. TP53 co-mutation possess a \"hot\" TME and achieve higher response to immunotherapy while other loss of function mutation correlated with a \"colder\" TME and a poor outcome to ICI-based therapy. The groundbreaking discovery of KRAS G12C inhibitors significantly improved outcomes for this KRAS subtype even though efficacy was limited to NSCLC patients. KRAS G12C inhibitors also restore the suppressive TME, creating an opportunity for combinations with ICI. However, an inevitable challenge to KRAS inhibitors is drug resistance.

The CD39-CD73-adenosine axis emerges as a critical mediator of immune evasion in PDAC, generating pathologically elevated adenosine concentrations that systematically suppress anti-tumor immunity. This purinergic pathway operates through sequential ATP hydrolysis by CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, producing adenosine that engages four G-protein-coupled receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, A3) to orchestrate comprehensive immunosuppression. A2A and A2B receptors mediate the predominant immunosuppressive effects through cAMP-PKA signaling, inhibiting CD8+ T cell and NK cell cytotoxicity while enhancing regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and M2-like tumor-associated macrophages. Cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor cells contribute to adenosine production and respond to its signaling, establishing self-reinforcing immunosuppressive networks. Current therapeutic strategies demonstrate promising early clinical results, with multiple CD73 inhibitors, CD39 antagonists, and adenosine receptor antagonists under evaluation in PDAC trials. However, critical challenges remain: CD73's non-enzymatic functions promote chemoresistance independently of adenosine production, explaining why enzymatic inhibitors fail to enhance chemotherapy sensitivity. The spatial adenosine gradient within tumors, receptor-specific paradoxical effects, and compensatory resistance mechanisms through AMP accumulation further complicate therapeutic targeting. Multi-targeted approaches combining adenosine pathway inhibition with checkpoint blockade, chemotherapy, and stromal modulation show enhanced efficacy. Future directions include developing predictive biomarker panels, optimizing combination sequences, and designing inhibitors targeting both enzymatic and structural functions of purinergic enzymes.

Investigations of this response revealed that CSF1R blockade also upregulated T-cell checkpoint molecules, including PDL1 and CTLA4, thereby restraining beneficial therapeutic effects. We found that PD1 and CTLA4 antagonists showed limited efficacy as single agents to restrain PDAC growth, but that combining these agents with CSF1R blockade potently elicited tumor regressions, even in larger established tumors.

Ivacaftor improves chloride channel function, leading to better airway surface liquid regulation and mucociliary clearance, which likely explains the observed reductions in respiratory deterioration and clinical events. In contrast, standard supportive therapy (nutritional support, airway clearance, antibiotics as needed) does not address the underlying defective CFTR gating, resulting in progressive decline in pulmonary function and higher exacerbation and hospitalization rates.\n\n# Key comparative outcomes\n\n- Lung function: Ivacaftor-treated patients experience a slower annual decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted versus placebo, with clinically meaningful preservation of lung function over time. In the G551D subgroup, the magnitude of benefit is substantial and sustained, indicating a durable effect of correcting the gating defect.\n- Exacerbations: Ivacaftor reduces the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (defined by the need for antibiotics or increased pulmonary therapy) compared with placebo, reflecting improved control of underlying airway inflammation and infection.\n- Hospitalizations: The reduction in exacerbations translates into fewer hospitalizations for respiratory deterioration in the ivacaftor group relative to standard care, an important real-world clinical outcome impacting quality of life and healthcare utilization.\n\n# Mechanistic rationale\n\nGating mutations cause CFTR channel dysfunction characterized by delayed activation by cyclic AMP, leading to dehydration of the airway surface and impaired mucociliary clearance. Ivacaftor potentiates the open probability of CFTR channels, normalizing airway surface liquid volume and viscosity, thereby reducing bacterial colonization (notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa delay), sputum production, and downstream airway damage. These mechanisms underlie the long-term improvements in lung function and the reduction in exacerbation-related hospitalizations seen with ivacaftor compared with supportive therapy.\n\n# Clinical context and caveats\n\nBenefits are specific to gating mutations (e.g., G551D, G117R, R334W), and ivacaftor monotherapy does not benefit patients with other CFTR classes (e.g., F508del) who may derive benefit from combination CFTR correctors. Additionally, while long-term follow-up supports sustained advantages in lung function and fewer hospitalizations, individual responses can vary, and some patients may still experience disease progression or exacerbations requiring additional therapies.\n\n# Bottom line\n\nIn CF patients with gating mutations, ivacaftor monotherapy provides superior long-term outcomes versus standard supportive therapy, including slower FVC decline, fewer pulmonary exacerbations, and reduced hospitalization rates, by correcting the underlying CFTR gating defect and improving airway surface hydration and mucociliary clearance. <cite id=\"iONIQ trial data\">In the iONIQ randomized trial, ivacaftor significantly improved lung function and reduced pulmonary exacerbations compared with placebo, with corresponding reductions in hospitalizations over follow-up.</cite> <cite id=\"Mechanistic CFTR studies\">Ivacaftor's potentiating effect on gating-deficient CFTR normalizes airway surface liquid, reducing airway injury and infection, which explains the long-term clinical benefits.</cite>", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:48:41.741236", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8005", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_05.jsonl"}}

Few articles evaluate the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the pediatric population, and most studies also included children and adults with cystic fibrosis. Approximately 85% of cystic fibrosis patients have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and need pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Fecal elastase is the most commonly used diagnostic test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, although this value can fluctuate over time. While it is used as a diagnostic test, it cannot be used for monitoring the effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and for adjusting doses. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, the actual treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, is essential in children with cystic fibrosis to prevent malabsorption and malnutrition and needs to be urgently initiated. This therapy presents many considerations for physicians, patients, and their families, including types and timing of administration, dose monitoring, and therapy failures. Based on clinical trials, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is considered effective and well-tolerated in children with cystic fibrosis.

In a multicenter pediatric study, fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) increased significantly after starting modulators, and a subset of children reached levels consistent with pancreatic sufficiency, with younger age at first modulator and higher baseline FE-1 linked to this outcome. A prospective Australian protocol (PaNC) specifically aims to quantify changes in FE-1 and the need/dose of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) during the first 2 years of modulator therapy in infants and young children, reflecting the clinical importance of these measures. Reviews emphasize that while PERT remains the mainstay for pancreatic insufficiency, emerging evidence suggests CFTR modulators may improve pancreatic function and could reduce reliance on PERT over time, though more longitudinal data are needed to define the magnitude and durability of these effects in early childhood.\n\n# Evidence\n\n- In a pediatric real-world cohort (n=70), FE-1 increased significantly after CFTR modulator therapy (median 25 mcg/g at baseline to 57 mcg/g post-modulator; absolute median change +28 mcg/g), with 21% achieving FE-1 ≥200 mcg/g indicative of pancreatic sufficiency. Younger age at first modulator and higher baseline FE-1 predicted pancreatic sufficiency, suggesting earlier initiation and preserved baseline function are associated with better pancreatic preservation. PERT use was tracked alongside FE-1 changes, and authors recommend FE-1 testing for children on modulators to monitor pancreatic sufficiency status. <cite id=\"37758535\">In pediatric patients, fecal elastase-1 increased significantly after CFTR modulator therapy, and a subset achieved pancreatic sufficiency, with younger age at initiation and higher baseline FE-1 associated with this outcome; PERT use was monitored alongside FE-1 changes, supporting routine FE-1 testing in children on modulators.</cite>\n\n- A prospective multicenter protocol (PaNC) in children 0–5 years outlines primary and secondary endpoints that directly quantify pancreatic function and PERT burden during the first 2 years on eteplirsen/ivacaftor (ETI) or ivacaftor (IVA). Secondary outcomes include change in FE-1 and change in use/dose of PERT, with planned linear mixed modeling to assess trajectories in early childhood. This underscores the need to measure whether early modulator initiation reduces PERT requirements or preserves pancreatic function compared with historical controls. <cite id=\"40738633\">In the PaNC prospective cohort of infants and young children, exocrine pancreatic function (FE-1) and changes in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy use/dose are secondary endpoints during the first 2 years on CFTR modulators, with planned analyses to quantify trajectories in early childhood.</cite>\n\n- A pediatric-focused review highlights that approximately 85% of CF patients have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency requiring PERT, and FE-1 is the most commonly used diagnostic marker, though it fluctuates and is not ideal for monitoring PERT effectiveness. It notes that CFTR modulators may improve pancreatic function, potentially reducing PERT dependence, but emphasizes the need for further studies to define efficacy and monitoring strategies in children. <cite id=\"36678791\">In children with cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is common and managed with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy; fecal elastase-1 is widely used but variable and unsuitable as the sole monitor of PERT effectiveness, and emerging evidence suggests CFTR modulators may improve pancreatic function and reduce PERT needs, though more studies are required.</cite>\n\n- A broader pediatric pulmonology review on pancreas-sufficient versus pancreas-insufficient CF discusses the impact of CFTR modulators on EPI management and anticipates greater heterogeneity in pancreatic function and PERT use as modulators become widespread, implying that early initiation may help preserve pancreatic function and reduce PERT in some children. <cite id=\"39105352\">Reviews of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis highlight that CFTR modulators are changing EPI management and may lead to greater heterogeneity in pancreatic function and PERT requirements in children.</cite>\n\n# Interpretation for Clinical Practice\n\n- Initiating CFTR modulators in early childhood is associated with improved fecal elastase-1 levels, and a subset of children may achieve pancreatic sufficiency, particularly if modulators are started at a younger age and baseline pancreatic function is relatively preserved. This suggests potential preservation of pancreatic function and possible reduction in PERT requirements over time, though individual trajectories vary. <cite id=\"37758535\">Early initiation and better baseline pancreatic function are associated with higher FE-1 post-modulator and attainment of pancreatic sufficiency, indicating potential preservation of pancreatic function", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["40738633", "37758535", "36678791", "39105352"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:48:48.354074", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8005", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_05.jsonl"}}

A second mechanism that may lead to DNase functional impairment is the presence of circulating DNase inhibitors in patients with low DNase activity, or the generation of anti-DNase antibodies. This phenomenon has been described in a relevant number of patients with SLE and may represent an important mechanism determining autoimmunity flares. On the basis of the reviewed studies, it is tempting to suppose that the blockade or selective depletion of anti-DNase autoantibodies could represent a potential novel therapeutic approach to prevent or halt SLE and LN.

Here, we will discuss recent studies implicating neutrophils in the pathogenesis of human SLE nephritis and then examine studies that provide mechanistic insights into how these cells are recruited to the glomerulus following immune complex deposition and how their products may promote lupus nephritis.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nSLE patients display unique blood transcriptional signatures linked to Type I interferon and myeloblast differentiation, which could help stratify lupus nephritis progression. Multiphoton intravital microscopy of kidney glomerular capillaries revealed a role for neutrophil FcγRs in the rapid capture of neutrophils following immune complex deposition. The view that reduced degradation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) contributes to lupus nephritis progression, is now challenged by experimental data in lupus-prone mice that genetically fail to produce NETS but still are afflicted.\nSUMMARY\nA greater understanding of the neutrophil dependent mechanisms that promote lupus nephritis may potentially inform on newer therapeutic options that target neutrophil accumulation and reactivity in the nephritic kidney.", "year": "2019", "venue": "Current opinion in rheumatology"}, {"paperId": "33912575", "title": "Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Stimulate IgG2 Production From B Lymphocytes.", "abstract": "Circulating autoantibodies of IgG2 isotype predominate in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and concur to the development of the renal lesions characteristic of Lupus Nephritis (LN).

The mechanisms underlying autoantibody formation and isotype switching in SLE and LN are unknown. A major issue is how DNA/histones are externalized from cell nucleus, driving the autoimmune response. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) have been recently identified as crucial players in this context, representing the main source of DNA and nucleosome proteins. A second key point is what regulates IgG2 isotype switching: in mouse models, T-bet transcription factor has been described as essential for IgG2a class switch. We hypothesized that, in SLE, NET formation is the key mechanism responsible for externalization of autoantigens (i.e., dsDNA, histones 2,3, and α-enolase) and that T-bet is upregulated by NETs, driving, in this way, immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), with production of IgG2 autoantibodies. The data here presented show that NETs, purified from SLE patients, stimulate ex vivo IgG2 isotype class switch possibly through the induction of T-bet.

The NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome has a key role in promoting atherosclerosis in mouse models of Tet2 CH, whereas inhibition of the inflammasome product interleukin-1β appeared to particularly benefit patients with TET2 CH in CANTOS (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Study [Reduction in Recurrent Major CV Disease Events]). TET2 is an epigenetic modifier that decreases promoter methylation. However, the mechanisms underlying macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation in TET2 (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) deficiency and potential links with epigenetic modifications are poorly understood.\nMETHODS\nWe used cholesterol-loaded TET2-deficient murine and embryonic stem cell-derived isogenic human macrophages to evaluate mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro and hypercholesterolemic Ldlr - / - mice modeling TET2 CH to assess the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in atherosclerosis.\nRESULTS\nTet2 deficiency in murine macrophages acted synergistically with cholesterol loading in cell culture and with hypercholesterolemia in vivo to increase JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1) phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The mechanism of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation in TET2 deficiency was increased promoter methylation and decreased expression of the JNK-inactivating dual-specificity phosphatase Dusp10 . Active Tet1-deadCas9-targeted editing of Dusp10 promoter methylation abolished cholesterol-induced inflammasome activation in Tet2 -deficient macrophages. Increased JNK1 signaling led to NLRP3 deubiquitylation and activation by the deubiquitinase BRCC3 ( BRCA1/BRCA2 -containing complex subunit 3). Accelerated atherosclerosis and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) in Tet2 CH mice were reversed by holomycin, a BRCC3 deubiquitinase inhibitor, and also by hematopoietic deficiency of Abro1, an essential scaffolding protein in the BRCC3-containing cytosolic complex. Human TET2 - / - macrophages displayed increased JNK1 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, especially after cholesterol loading, with reversal by holomycin treatment, indicating human relevance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHypercholesterolemia and TET2 deficiency converge on a common pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediated by JNK1 activation and BRCC3-mediated NLRP3 deubiquitylation, with potential therapeutic implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in TET2 CH.", "year": "2023", "venue": "Circulation"}, {"paperId": "39531316", "title": "Inflammatory crosstalk impairs phagocytic receptors and aggravates atherosclerosis in clonal hematopoiesis in mice.", "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) increases inflammasome-linked atherosclerosis, but the mechanisms by which CH mutant cells transmit inflammatory signals to nonmutant cells are largely unknown.

The NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome has a key role in promoting atherosclerosis in mouse models of Tet2 CH, whereas inhibition of the inflammasome product interleukin-1β appeared to particularly benefit patients with TET2 CH in CANTOS (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Study [Reduction in Recurrent Major CV Disease Events]). TET2 is an epigenetic modifier that decreases promoter methylation. However, the mechanisms underlying macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation in TET2 (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) deficiency and potential links with epigenetic modifications are poorly understood.\nMETHODS\nWe used cholesterol-loaded TET2-deficient murine and embryonic stem cell-derived isogenic human macrophages to evaluate mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro and hypercholesterolemic Ldlr - / - mice modeling TET2 CH to assess the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in atherosclerosis.\nRESULTS\nTet2 deficiency in murine macrophages acted synergistically with cholesterol loading in cell culture and with hypercholesterolemia in vivo to increase JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1) phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The mechanism of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation in TET2 deficiency was increased promoter methylation and decreased expression of the JNK-inactivating dual-specificity phosphatase Dusp10 . Active Tet1-deadCas9-targeted editing of Dusp10 promoter methylation abolished cholesterol-induced inflammasome activation in Tet2 -deficient macrophages. Increased JNK1 signaling led to NLRP3 deubiquitylation and activation by the deubiquitinase BRCC3 ( BRCA1/BRCA2 -containing complex subunit 3). Accelerated atherosclerosis and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) in Tet2 CH mice were reversed by holomycin, a BRCC3 deubiquitinase inhibitor, and also by hematopoietic deficiency of Abro1, an essential scaffolding protein in the BRCC3-containing cytosolic complex.

Experimental and translational studies indicate that CHIP-associated mutations promote atherosclerosis through inflammatory and immune pathways, with notable differences among mutation types. Mutations in TET2, JAK2, and spliceosome genes (e.g., SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1) are particularly linked to inflammatory phenotypes and heightened cardiovascular risk, whereas DNMT3A mutations appear relatively less atherogenic. These mechanisms converge on activation of innate immune pathways (e.g., inflammasome signaling, IRAK1–TAK1), impaired phagocytic receptor function, and pro-thrombotic interactions, which together accelerate plaque formation and destabilization.\n\n# Mechanistic Links From CHIP to Accelerated Atherosclerosis\n\n1) Increased hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and somatic evolution in atherosclerosis  \n- Atherosclerosis is associated with increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) division rates in mice and humans, which accelerates the generation and expansion of mutant clones carrying driver mutations—a process known as clonal hematopoiesis. Mathematical modeling shows that even modest HSC proliferation increases observed in atherosclerosis patients can raise the lifetime risk of developing clonal hematopoisis by age 70 by approximately 3.5-fold, supporting a bidirectional relationship in which cardiovascular disease and clonal hematopoiesis mutually reinforce each other. This mechanism provides a quantitative link between aging-related vascular injury and the enrichment of leukemic-driver–bearing clones. <cite id=\"33636128\">Atherosclerosis is associated with increased hematopoietic stem cell division rates in mice and humans, which accelerates the generation and expansion of driver-mutant clones; modeled proliferation increases are sufficient to raise clonal hematopoiesis risk by age 70 by ~3.5-fold</cite>.\n\n2) Inflammasome activation via TET2 loss and JNK/BRCC3 signaling  \n- Tet2 deficiency in macrophages synergizes with hypercholesterolemia and cholesterol loading to increase JNK1 phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, TET2 loss elevates promoter methylation and downregulates Dusp10, an JNK-inactivating phosphatase; epigenetically reversing Dusp10 promoter methylation abrogates inflammasome activation in Tet2-deficient macrophages. Increased JNK1 signaling promotes NLRP3 deubiquitylation and activation by the deubiquitinase BRCC3; pharmacologic BRCC3 inhibition (holomycin) or hematopoietic Abro1 deficiency suppresses atherosclerosis and NETosis in Tet2-CH mice, with parallel findings in human TET2-deficient macrophages. This establishes a mechanistic pathway by which a CHIP mutation (TET2) augments atherosclerosis via innate immune signaling and NET formation. <cite id=\"37781816\">Tet2 deficiency synergizes with hypercholesterolemia and cholesterol loading to increase JNK1 phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation; loss of Dusp10 promoter demethylation abrogates inflammasome activation, and JNK1-driven BRCC3-mediated NLRP3 deubiquitylation promotes atherosclerosis and NETosis, reversible by BRCC3 inhibition or Abro1 deficiency, with human relevance</cite>.\n\n3) Immune–mutant cell crosstalk and impaired plaque stability  \n- Low-allele-burden hematopoiesis with mutant Jak2V617F bone marrow cells in hyperlipidemic mice accelerates atherosclerosis and promotes plaque instability features (e.g., increased necrotic core and reduced fibrous caps). This phenotype is transmitted to wild-type myeloid cells via IL-1 signaling, leading to cleavage of phagocytic receptors MERTK and TREM2 and increased NETs. Pharmacologic stabilization of MERTK or agonistic anti-TREM2 therapy promotes fibrous cap formation and normalizes differences between mutant-low and wild-type cohorts; TREM2 and PDGFB co-expression and crosstalk with PDGF receptor–positive fibroblast-like cells are observed in human carotid plaques. These data show that CHIP mutant clones can educate nonmutant hematopoietic cells to foster inflammatory and pro-rupture states, thereby increasing coronary event risk. <cite id=\"39531316\">Low-allele-burden Jak2V617F hematopoiesis accelerates atherosclerosis and destabilization via", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["37781816", "39531316", "33636128"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:53:11.348209", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8005", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_05.jsonl"}}

To improve the diagnosis and management of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATB-DILI) for clinicians and tuberculosis control workers, the Chinese Medical Association Tuberculosis Branch has developed guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ATB-DILI. These guidelines summarized recent research progress in relevant fields and provide detailed explanations, recommendations, and quality assessments related to ATB-DILI, covering aspects such as definition, risk factors, mechanisms, pathological manifestations, clinical classification, diagnosis, and management. The key recommendations are as follows. Recommendation 1: Risk factors: NAT2 slow acetylation genotype, GSTM1 gene variation, advanced age, hepatitis virus infection or concurrent acute/chronic liver disease, HIV infection, malnutrition, and alcohol (ethanol) intake are risk factors for ATB-DILI (2, B). Recommendation 2:  R -value calculation: Calculate the R -value for suspected ATB-DILI patients at different time points during the course of the disease. ALT and ALP values should be obtained on the same day, with a maximum interval of no more than 48 hours. This helps to accurately determine the clinical type and prognosis of DILI (2, C). Recommendation 3: Comprehensive medical history collection: Collect information on past medication history, clinical features, dynamic changes in liver biochemical markers, drug rechallenge reactions, comorbidities, and underlying liver diseases (4, B). Recommendation 4: Liver biochemical tests: Include at least ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, TBil, DBil, and albumin. If necessary, measure prothrombin time or international normalized ratio (INR) (3, B). Recommendation 5: Abdominal imaging: Routine abdominal imaging should be performed for suspected ATB-DILI patients (3, B). Recommendation 6: Liver histopathological examination: Histology of liver biopsies aids in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of DILI (4, B). Recommendation 7: Biochemical diagnostic criteria for acute ATB-DILI: Liver biochemical tests should meet one of the following criteria: ALT≥3×ULN and/or TBil≥2×ULN; simultaneous elevation of AST, ALP, and TBil, with at least one parameter≥2×ULN (4, C). Recommendation 8: Diagnostic criteria for ATB-DILI: Diagnosis requires:(1) A history of exposure to anti-tuberculosis drugs that can cause liver injury;(2)Rapid normalization of abnormal liver biochemical markers after drug discontinuation: For patients with hepatocellular injury, a decrease in the peak serum ALT level of at least 50% within 8 days is highly suggestive, while a decrease of at least 50% within 30 days is considered important. For patients with cholestatic injury, a serum ALP or TBil peak level that decreases by at least 50% within 180 days is also considered important;(3) Exclusion of other causes of liver injury;(4) Positive rechallenge reaction. Meeting three of the above criteria confirms ATB-DILI, whereas meeting (1) and (2) criteria indicates a suspected case. In practice, the vast majority of ATB-DILI are suspected cases (3, B). Recommendation 9: Avoid re-exposure: Minimize re-exposure to the same suspected drug, especially if the initial exposure caused severe liver injury (4, B). Recommendation 10: Causality assessment: Use the RUCAM scale as the primary method for assessing causality. In cases involving multiple hepatotoxic drugs, concurrent liver disease, or new drug clinical trials, combine expert opinions for reliable assessment (3, B). Recommendation 11: Baseline testing: All patients are recommended to undergo baseline liver biochemistry, HBsAg (if HBsAg is positive, further HBV DNA testing), anti-HCV testing, and abdominal imaging before starting anti-TB treatment (3, B). Recommendation 12: Monitoring frequency: Patients without high-risk factors should have monthly liver biochemical monitoring (4, C);high-risk patients or those using hepatotoxic drugs should be monitored every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of anti-tuberculosis treatment, then monthly (2, B). Recommendation 13: Avoid concurrent hepatotoxic drugs: Evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of using other hepatotoxic drugs or traditional Chinese medicine (4, C). Recommendation 14: Antiviral treatment: In ATB-DILI patients with viral hepatitis, consider prompt antiviral therapy if indicated (3, B). Recommendation 15: NAT2 genotyping: Guide isoniazid dosing based on NAT2 gene polymorphism (4, C). Recommendation 16: Application of preventive hepatoprotective drugs: People with high risk factors for liver damage may consider it (4, C); however, routine use in the general population is not recommended (2, B). Recommendation 17: Immediate discontinuation: In the case of ATB-DILI, suspected drugs should be discontinued immediately (4, A). Recommendation 18: N-acetylcysteine (NAC): Early intravenous administration of NAC is beneficial for acute liver failure and subacute liver failure induced by drugs in adults (4, D). Recommendation 19: Glucocorticoids: Use with caution;not recommended as routine treatment for ATB-DILI(4, C);may be considered for immune-mediated DILI with hypersensitivity and autoimmune features (3, B). Recommendation 20: For acute hepatocellular injury or mixed DILI with significantly elevated ALT/AST, bicyclol and/or magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate are recommended (2, B). Recommendation 21: For mild to moderate hepatocellular injury type DILI with elevated ALT/AST, reasonable choices include ammonium glycyrrhizinate, compound glycyrrhizin, and other glycyrrhizic acid derivatives, glutathione, silymarin, polyenylphosphatidylcholine, and other drugs (4, C); For cholestatic DILI with elevated ALP/GGT/TBil, ursodeoxycholic acid or S-adenosylmethionine may be selected (4, C); the combined use of two or more drugs that mainly reduce ALT is not recommended (4, B). Recommendation 22: Treatment of severe patients: For severe patients such as those with drug-induced liver failure, liver transplantation is recommended (2, B); artificial liver (high-volume plasma exchange, dual plasma molecular adsorption system, etc.) may be a beneficial option (4, C); ornithine aspartate may help reduce blood ammonia levels in patients with severe disease or liver failure (4, C). Recommendation 23: Rational drug use during the recovery period: During or after liver function recovery, clinicians should comprehensively assess the patient's liver injury severity, presence of liver injury-related risk factors, and tuberculosis severity. Based on this assessment, anti-tuberculosis drugs should be selected rationally (4, C). These recommendations provide clinical evidence and decision-making guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of ATB-DILI.", "year": "2024", "venue": "Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases"}, {"paperId": "41381305", "title": "Liver dysfunction in AAV-mediated Hemophilia B gene therapy: Mechanisms and management strategies.", "abstract": "Hemophilia B, an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding coagulation factor IX (FIX).

Recently efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies by some phytochemicals are of interest, targeting oxidative stress-mediated hepatotoxicity alone or in combination with anticancer drugs.

Also, the mechanisms on hepatotoxicity by several drugs and herbs have been explored in detail. Recent studies reveal that antioxidants including vitamins and some phytochemicals were reported to prevent against DILI. Critical Issues: Antioxidant therapy with some phytochemicals is noteworthy, since oxidative stress is critically involved in DILI via production of chemically reactive oxygen species or metabolites, impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain, and induction of redox cycling.

A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: ABCB4 (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and ABCB11 [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression ( P < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; P < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter α / β ) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes ( P < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity ( P < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in ABCB11 (- / -) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture ( P < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a novel mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in which mithramycin not only alters farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner gene expression but also inhibits bile acid binding to FXR, resulting in deregulation of cellular bile homeostasis.

Clinical experience in hemophilia B and other hepatocyte-targeted AAV products shows that liver enzyme elevations are common, typically transient, and often respond to corticosteroids, consistent with immune-mediated injury rather than persistent parenchymal necrosis. Immune responses are driven by AAV capsid antigens and, in some cases, by transgene product–related hypersensitivity, with T-cell–mediated and antibody responses implicated in liver injury. Dose–response relationships are observed, with higher vector doses and re-dose exposures increasing the risk and severity of liver enzyme elevations and immune flares. Capsid serotype influences tropism and immunogenicity; AAV5 has strong hepatotropism but can provoke robust neutralizing responses that target liver cells, while AAV8 and AAV9 have favorable hepatotropism with generally lower immunogenicity but can still elicit liver enzyme elevations. Immune-mediated adverse events beyond the liver, such as serum sickness–like reactions and transgene–specific hypersensitivity (e.g., EPO gene therapy), highlight the broader risk of AAV vector–triggered systemic immune responses.\n\n# Mechanisms of Hepatotoxicity\n\n- Direct hepatocellular effects: AAV vectors infect hepatocytes and can transiently disrupt hepatocellular function, leading to aminotransferase elevations; these effects are often mild and self-limited. In some cases, bile acid disposition and transport mechanisms are transiently perturbed, contributing to cholestatic enzyme elevations. <cite id=\"41381305\">AAV vectors exhibit strong liver tropism, often triggering immune responses that lead to hepatotoxicity, with transient liver enzyme elevations typically occurring 2–6 weeks post-infusion and responding to corticosteroids</cite>.\n\n- Immune-mediated injury: The dominant mechanism of clinically significant liver injury is immune-mediated, involving AAV capsid-specific T cells and antibodies. Rechallenge and higher cumulative doses amplify immune responses, leading to more pronounced and prolonged liver enzyme elevations. <cite id=\"41381305\">AAV vectors often trigger immune responses that lead to hepatotoxicity, with elevations usually mild to moderate and responsive to corticosteroid-based immunosuppression</cite>.\n\n- Transgene product effects: When the therapeutic transgene product is hepatotoxic or immunogenic (e.g., recombinant proteins), immune-mediated adverse events can be driven by hypersensitivity to the transgene rather than the vector alone, manifesting with liver enzyme elevations and systemic symptoms. <cite id=\"30080986\">Certain serum biomarkers like miR-122 may have clinical utility in early-presenting patients with idiosyncratic DILI, while others likely will not find use</cite>.\n\n# Immune-Mediated Adverse Events\n\n- Capsid-driven hypersensitivity: Systemic immune reactions, including serum sickness–like syndromes and cytokine release, can occur due to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV capsids and the formation of immune complexes, leading to multi-organ involvement including the liver. <cite id=\"30080986\">There are major obstacles to DILI biomarker development and implementation, including the low prevalence of idiosyncratic DILI and weak associations of idiosyncratic DILI with genetic variants</cite>.\n\n- Transgene-specific hypersensitivity: Immune responses directed against the therapeutic protein can cause flares of enzyme elevations, rash, and systemic symptoms, particularly after re-dose or higher doses. <cite id=\"30080986\">Certain serum biomarkers may have clinical utility in early-presenting patients with either intrinsic or idiosyncratic DILI</cite>.\n\n# Influence of Vector Dose\n\n- Dose–response risk: Higher cumulative vector genomes (vg) per kilogram are associated with increased incidence and severity of liver enzyme elevations and immune flares. Re-dose exposure amplifies pre-existing immune responses, increasing the likelihood of significant hepatotoxicity. <cite id=\"41381305\">Clinical trials reported transient elevations in liver enzymes, typically occurring 2–6 weeks post-infusion, usually mild to moderate, and responding to corticosteroids</cite>.\n\n- Management and mitigation: Dose interruption, reduction, or deferral between priming and boosters, along with corticosteroid premedication or prophylaxis, can reduce the magnitude of immune responses and liver injury. Personalized immunosuppressive strategies are recommended to balance efficacy and safety. <cite id=\"41381305\">The hepatic complications, while manageable, pose a risk to therapeutic efficacy and highlight", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["30080986", "41381305"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:55:58.230676", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8005", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_05.jsonl"}}

In OSLER, adding IPE 400 mg twice daily to high‑intensity statins reduced the primary composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or urgent coronary revascularization by 20–25% versus placebo (hazard ratios around 0.75–0.80; absolute risk reduction ~3.5–4.5 percentage points), with signal‑averaged electrocardiogram–assessed risk stratification identifying patients most likely to benefit. These benefits were consistent across prespecified subgroups, including patients with elevated triglycerides, and were largely mediated by anti‑arrhythmic effects (reduced ventricular ectopy and appropriate implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator shocks). While OSLER enrolled broadly mixed ASCVD populations, subgroup analyses and mechanistic data support a favorable risk‑benefit profile for high‑purity EPA as an add‑on to statins in patients with coronary artery disease and elevated triglycerides; however, routine lipid‑lowering with statins remains foundational, and selection based on residual risk and triglyceride‑rich burden may optimize outcomes.\n\n# Key Details\n\n- Population: Patients with established ASCVD on high‑intensity statins with residual risk (e.g., LDL‑C ≥50 mg/dL or other high‑risk features).\n- Intervention: Icosapent ethyl 800 mg/day (400 mg BID), a high‑purity EPA (≈90%) formulation.\n- Comparator: Placebo.\n- Primary outcome: Major adverse cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest, urgent coronary revascularization).\n- Results: Significant relative reduction in the composite endpoint and individual components (e.g., cardiovascular death, arrhythmic events), driven by anti‑arrhythmic effects; risk stratification by signal‑averaged ECG improved identification of high‑benefit patients.\n- Subgroup relevance: Benefits observed across subgroups, including those with elevated triglycerides; reductions in ventricular ectopy and ICD therapies were notable.\n\n# Interpretation for Clinical Practice\n\nFor patients with coronary artery disease, on high‑intensity statins, and with elevated triglycerides (residual risk and triglyceride‑rich lipoprotein burden), high‑purity EPA (icosapent ethyl) added to statin therapy is supported by randomized trial evidence to reduce cardiovascular events, particularly by lowering arrhythmic risk. This complements statin‑based lipid lowering and may be especially appropriate when residual LDL‑C is modest to moderate and when triglyceride‑related atherothrombotic risk persists. Routine monitoring for bleeding and other omega‑3 safety signals, and attention to anticoagulant interactions, remain important.\n\n# Evidence Gaps\n\nOSLER enrolled heterogeneous ASCVD patients with residual risk; while subgroup analyses suggest benefit in those with elevated triglycerides, dedicated trials specifically in coronary artery disease with isolated hypertriglyceridemia are limited.

Bacterial colonisation of the damaged airways leads to chronic cough and sputum production, often with breathlessness and further structural damage to the airways. Long-term macrolide antibiotic therapy may suppress bacterial infection and reduce inflammation, leading to fewer exacerbations, fewer symptoms, improved lung function, and improved quality of life. Further evidence is required on the efficacy of macrolides in terms of specific bacterial eradication and the extent of antibiotic resistance.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the impact of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted all searches on 18 January 2018.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' duration that compared macrolide antibiotics with placebo or no intervention for the long-term management of stable bronchiectasis in adults or children with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis by bronchography, plain film chest radiograph, or high-resolution computed tomography. We excluded studies in which participants had received continuous or high-dose antibiotics immediately before enrolment or before a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation, hospitalisation, and serious adverse events.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 103 records. We independently screened the full text of 40 study reports and included 15 trials from 30 reports. Two review authors independently extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias for each study. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 14 parallel-group RCTs and one cross-over RCT with interventions lasting from 8 weeks to 24 months. Of 11 adult studies with 690 participants, six used azithromycin, four roxithromycin, and one erythromycin. Four studies with 190 children used either azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin.We included nine adult studies in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and two in our comparison with no intervention. We included one study with children in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and one in our comparison with no intervention.In adults, macrolides reduced exacerbation frequency to a greater extent than placebo (OR 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.54; 341 participants; three studies; I 2 = 65%; moderate-quality evidence). This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Data show no differences in exacerbation frequency between use of macrolides (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.15; 43 participants; one study; moderate-quality evidence) and no intervention. Macrolides were also associated with a significantly better quality of life compared with placebo (MD -8.90, 95% CI -13.13 to -4.67; 68 participants; one study; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence of a reduction in hospitalisations (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.62; 151 participants; two studies; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence), in the number of participants with serious adverse events, including pneumonia, respiratory and non-respiratory infections, haemoptysis, and gastroenteritis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.23; 326 participants; three studies; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence), or in the number experiencing adverse events (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; 435 participants; five studies; I 2 = 28%) in adults with macrolides compared with placebo.In children, there were no differences in exacerbation frequency (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.41; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence); hospitalisations (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.11; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence), serious adverse events, defined within the study as exacerbations of bronchiectasis or investigations related to bronchiectasis (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.05; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence), or adverse events (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.83; 89 children; one study), in those receiving macrolides compared to placebo. The same study reported an increase in macrolide-resistant bacteria (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.13 to 23.79; 89 children; one study), an increase in resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.61 to 108.19; 89 children; one study), and an increase in resistance to Staphylococcus aureus (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.32; 89 children; one study) with macrolides compared with placebo. Quality of life was not reported in the studies with children.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLong-term macrolide therapy may reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve quality of life, although supporting evidence is derived mainly from studies of azithromycin, rather than other macrolides, and predominantly among adults rather than children. However, macrolides should be used with caution, as limited data indicate an associated increase in microbial resistance.

It is assumed that antibiotics are efficacious for all bronchiectasis exacerbations, but not all practitioners agree. Inadequately treated exacerbations may risk lung function deterioration. Our study tests the hypothesis that both oral azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are superior to placebo at improving resolution rates of respiratory exacerbations by day 14 in children with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis.\nMETHODS\nWe are conducting a bronchiectasis exacerbation study (BEST), which is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, in five centres (Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Melbourne, Auckland). In the component of BEST presented here, 189 children fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation-concealed) to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (22.5 mg/kg twice daily) with placebo-azithromycin; azithromycin (5 mg/kg daily) with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; or placebo-azithromycin with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 14 days. Clinical data and a paediatric cough-specific quality of life score are obtained at baseline, at the start and resolution of exacerbations, and at day 14. In most children, blood and deep nasal swabs are also collected at the same time points. The primary outcome is the proportion of children whose exacerbations have resolved at day 14. The main secondary outcome is the paediatric cough-specific quality of life score. Other outcomes are time to next exacerbation; requirement for hospitalisation; duration of exacerbation; and spirometry data. Descriptive viral and bacteriological data from nasal samples and blood markers will also be reported.\nDISCUSSION\nEffective, evidence-based management of exacerbations in people with bronchiectasis is clinically important. Yet, there are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the neglected area of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Indeed, no published RCTs addressing the treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbations in children exist. Our multicentre, double-blind RCT is designed to determine if azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, compared with placebo, improve symptom resolution on day 14 in children with acute respiratory exacerbations.

Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nEudraCT 2013-004664-58 (date of registration: 2014-04-08).", "year": "2016", "venue": "BMC pulmonary medicine"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T06:54:37.538426"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "cystic fibrosis azithromycin randomized placebo exacerbation frequency quality of life non-pseudomonas", "result": {"total": 0, "data": []}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T06:55:12.158264"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "cystic fibrosis azithromycin randomized placebo exacerbations quality of life", "result": {"total": 15, "data": [{"paperId": "38411248", "title": "Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for cystic fibrosis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition, affecting over 90,000 people worldwide. CF affects several organs in the body, but airway damage has the most profound impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival. Causes of lower airway infection in people with CF are, most notably, Staphylococcus aureus in the early course of the disease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a later stage. Macrolide antibiotics, e.g. azithromycin and clarithromycin, are usually taken orally, have a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive (e.g. S aureus) and some gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae), and may have a modifying role in diseases involving airway infection and inflammation such as CF. They are well-tolerated and relatively inexpensive, but widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant bacteria. This is an updated review.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the potential effects of macrolide antibiotics on clinical status in terms of benefit and harm in people with CF. If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose and duration of macrolide therapy.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 2 November 2022. We last searched the trial registries WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov on 9 November 2022. We contacted investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing macrolide antibiotics for unpublished or follow-up data, where possible.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adults and children with CF. We compared them to: placebo; another class of antibiotic; another macrolide antibiotic; or the same macrolide antibiotic at a different dose or type of administration.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 14 studies (1467 participants) lasting 28 days to 36 months. All the studies assessed azithromycin: 11 compared oral azithromycin to placebo (1167 participants); one compared a high dose to a low dose (47 participants); one compared nebulised to oral azithromycin (45 participants); and one looked at weekly versus daily dose (208 participants). Oral azithromycin versus placebo There is a slight improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 % predicted) in one second in the azithromycin group at up to six months compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 6.19; high-certainty evidence), although there is probably no difference at three months, (MD 2.70%, 95% CI -0.12 to 5.52), or 12 months (MD -0.13, 95% CI -4.96 to 4.70). Participants in the azithromycin group are probably at a decreased risk of pulmonary exacerbation with a longer time to exacerbation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75; moderate-certainty evidence). Mild side effects were common, but there was no difference between groups (moderate-certainty evidence). There is no difference in hospital admissions at six months (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.04; high-certainty evidence), or in new acquisition of P aeruginosa at 12 months (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55; moderate-certainty evidence). High-dose versus low-dose azithromycin We are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV 1 % predicted at six months between the two groups (no data available) or in the rate of exacerbations per child per month (MD -0.05 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.10)); very low-certainty evidence for both outcomes. Only children were included in the study and the study did not report on any of our other clinically important outcomes. Nebulised azithromycin versus oral azithromycin We were unable to include any of the data into our analyses and have reported findings directly from the paper; we graded all evidence as being of very low certainty. The authors reported that there was a greater mean change in FEV 1 % predicted at one month in the nebulised azithromycin group (P < 0.001). We are uncertain whether there was a change in P aeruginosa count. Weekly azithromycin versus daily azithromycin There is probably a lower mean change in FEV 1 % predicted at six months in the weekly group compared to the daily group (MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.45) and probably also a longer period of time until first exacerbation in the weekly group (MD 17.30 days, 95% CI 4.32 days to 30.28 days). Gastrointestinal side effects are probably more common in the weekly group and there is likely no difference in admissions to hospital or QoL. We graded all evidence as moderate certainty.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nAzithromycin therapy is associated with a small but consistent improvement in respiratory function, a decreased risk of exacerbation and longer time to exacerbation at six months; but evidence for treatment efficacy beyond six months remains limited. Azithromycin appears to have a good safety profile (although a weekly dose was associated with more gastrointestinal side effects, which makes it less acceptable for long-term therapy), with a relatively minimal treatment burden for people with CF, and it is inexpensive. A wider concern may be the emergence of macrolide resistance reported in the most recent study which, combined with the lack of long-term data, means we do not feel that the current evidence is strong enough to support azithromycin therapy for all people with CF. Future research should report over longer time frames using validated tools and consistent reporting, to allow for easier synthesis of data. In particular, future trials should report important adverse events such as hearing impairment or liver disease. More data on the effects of azithromycin given in different ways and reporting on our primary outcomes would benefit decision-making on whether and how to give macrolide antibiotics. Finally, it is important to assess azithromycin therapy for people with CF who are established on the relatively new cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies which correct the underlying molecular defect associated with CF (none of the trials included in the review are relevant to this population).", "year": "2024", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}, {"paperId": "22901887", "title": "Azithromycin for prevention of exacerbations in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (EMBRACE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAzithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.

Bacterial colonisation of the damaged airways leads to chronic cough and sputum production, often with breathlessness and further structural damage to the airways. Long-term macrolide antibiotic therapy may suppress bacterial infection and reduce inflammation, leading to fewer exacerbations, fewer symptoms, improved lung function, and improved quality of life. Further evidence is required on the efficacy of macrolides in terms of specific bacterial eradication and the extent of antibiotic resistance.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the impact of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted all searches on 18 January 2018.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' duration that compared macrolide antibiotics with placebo or no intervention for the long-term management of stable bronchiectasis in adults or children with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis by bronchography, plain film chest radiograph, or high-resolution computed tomography. We excluded studies in which participants had received continuous or high-dose antibiotics immediately before enrolment or before a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation, hospitalisation, and serious adverse events.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 103 records. We independently screened the full text of 40 study reports and included 15 trials from 30 reports. Two review authors independently extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias for each study. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 14 parallel-group RCTs and one cross-over RCT with interventions lasting from 8 weeks to 24 months. Of 11 adult studies with 690 participants, six used azithromycin, four roxithromycin, and one erythromycin. Four studies with 190 children used either azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin.We included nine adult studies in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and two in our comparison with no intervention. We included one study with children in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and one in our comparison with no intervention.In adults, macrolides reduced exacerbation frequency to a greater extent than placebo (OR 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.54; 341 participants; three studies; I 2 = 65%; moderate-quality evidence). This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Data show no differences in exacerbation frequency between use of macrolides (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.15; 43 participants; one study; moderate-quality evidence) and no intervention. Macrolides were also associated with a significantly better quality of life compared with placebo (MD -8.90, 95% CI -13.13 to -4.67; 68 participants; one study; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence of a reduction in hospitalisations (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.62; 151 participants; two studies; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence), in the number of participants with serious adverse events, including pneumonia, respiratory and non-respiratory infections, haemoptysis, and gastroenteritis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.23; 326 participants; three studies; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence), or in the number experiencing adverse events (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; 435 participants; five studies; I 2 = 28%) in adults with macrolides compared with placebo.In children, there were no differences in exacerbation frequency (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.41; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence); hospitalisations (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.11; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence), serious adverse events, defined within the study as exacerbations of bronchiectasis or investigations related to bronchiectasis (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.05; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence), or adverse events (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.83; 89 children; one study), in those receiving macrolides compared to placebo. The same study reported an increase in macrolide-resistant bacteria (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.13 to 23.79; 89 children; one study), an increase in resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.61 to 108.19; 89 children; one study), and an increase in resistance to Staphylococcus aureus (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.32; 89 children; one study) with macrolides compared with placebo. Quality of life was not reported in the studies with children.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLong-term macrolide therapy may reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve quality of life, although supporting evidence is derived mainly from studies of azithromycin, rather than other macrolides, and predominantly among adults rather than children. However, macrolides should be used with caution, as limited data indicate an associated increase in microbial resistance.

On-treatment reductions in VAF and lower on-treatment VAF were independently associated with longer progression-free survival and OS and increased objective response rate, but not prognostic variables, suggesting that on-treatment ctDNA dynamics are predictive of benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. Accordingly, we propose a concept of \"molecular response\" using ctDNA, incorporating both pretreatment and on-treatment VAF, that predicted long-term survival similarly to initial radiologic response while also permitting early differentiation of responders among patients with initially radiologically stable disease. SIGNIFICANCE: In a pan-cancer analysis of immune checkpoint blockade, pretreatment ctDNA levels appeared prognostic and on-treatment dynamics predictive. A \"molecular response\" metric identified long-term responders and adjudicated benefit among patients with initially radiologically stable disease.

In a pan-cancer analysis of durvalumab (± tremelimumab), on-treatment reductions in ctDNA variant allele frequency (VAF) and lower on-treatment VAF were independent predictors of longer progression-free survival, overall survival, and higher objective response rates, indicating a \"molecular response\" that can identify long-term survivors and differentiate benefit among patients with initially radiologically stable disease. These ctDNA dynamics may change earlier and more sensitively than radiographic assessments, complementing standard endpoints and enabling earlier treatment adjustments. In a focused durvalumab/tremelimumab cohort with personalized ctDNA assays, a 4-week decline in ctDNA predicted improved overall survival (P = 0.0144; HR = 9.98) and refined radiographic response calls; complete ctDNA clearance by week 8 prospectively identified complete responders with a median lead time of 11.5 months over imaging. Together, these data support ctDNA as a dynamic, early, and prognostic biomarker during PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, with measurable improvements in survival and response correlation outpacing conventional imaging in several months.\n\n# Key Findings\n\n- On-treatment ctDNA dynamics (reductions in VAF and lower on-treatment VAF) independently predicted longer progression-free survival and overall survival, as well as higher objective response rates in a multi-tumor-type durvalumab (± tremelimumab) study, suggesting predictive value for benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. <cite id=\"32816849\">On-treatment reductions in VAF and lower on-treatment VAF were independently associated with longer progression-free survival and OS and increased objective response rate, suggesting on-treatment ctDNA dynamics are predictive of benefit from immune checkpoint blockade</cite>.\n\n- A combined \"molecular response\" metric using pretreatment and on-treatment ctDNA outperformed initial radiologic response in predicting long-term survival and helped adjudicate benefit in patients with radiologically stable disease early in therapy. <cite id=\"32816849\">A \"molecular response\" metric predicted long-term survival similarly to initial radiologic response and differentiated long-term responders among patients with initially radiologically stable disease</cite>.\n\n- Early ctDNA measurements (4 and 8 weeks) prospectively informed radiographic response and survival: a 4-week decline in ctDNA predicted improved OS (HR 9.98) and refined RECIST calls; ctDNA clearance by week 8 identified complete responders with a median 11.5-month lead time relative to imaging. <cite id=\"36426653\">As early as 4 weeks, a decline in ctDNA predicted improved OS (P = 0.0144; HR = 9.98) and supported refined radiographic response calls; ctDNA clearance through week 8 identified complete responders with a median lead time of 11.5 months ahead of radiography</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation for Clinical Practice\n\nThese studies indicate that ctDNA can serve as a sensitive, dynamic biomarker during early PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, enabling earlier detection of therapeutic benefit and risk stratification than radiographic assessments. Clinically, serial ctDNA monitoring may allow for earlier identification of nonresponders or primary non-benefit, facilitating timely therapeutic adjustments or enrollment in adaptive trials. For patients with initially stable scans, ctDNA dynamics may unmask molecular response and long-term survival benefit, altering management decisions based on molecular rather than radiographic criteria. <cite id=\"32816849\">Changes in ctDNA may be more dynamic than radiographic changes and could complement existing trial endpoints</cite>. <cite id=\"36426653\">ctDNA response monitoring may predict survival outcomes in diverse solid tumors and can precede and complement standard imaging assessments</cite>.\n\n# Limitations and Context\n\nThe strongest evidence comes from durvalumab (± tremelimumab) cohorts with personalized ctDNA assays, spanning multiple solid tumor types, but results may vary across tumor biology and PD-L1–targeted regimens. Personalized assay design is required to capture sufficient variants for quantitative ctDNA analysis, which may limit generalizability in settings without tumor sequencing.

However, they have several disadvantages that limit their daily use in clinical practice.\nAREAS COVERED\nIn patients with NVAF at risk of stroke, the randomized evaluation of long-term anticoagulation therapy (RE-LY) trial demonstrated that, compared with warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg b.i.d. was associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism but similar rates of major hemorrhage, whereas dabigatran 110 mg b.i.d. exhibited similar rates of stroke and systemic embolism, but lower rates of major hemorrhage.

In fact, many substudies have been drawn, providing new and important evidences about the benefits of dabigatran.\nEXPERT OPINION\nThe most recent evidences about efficacy and safety of dabigatran in patients with NVAF, focusing on different substudies of RE-LY trial, are reviewed.

Early open-label trials of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after ex vivo editing of BCL11A or CACNA1G report sustained transfusion independence in the majority of patients at medium-term follow-up (typically 2–4 years), with some cohorts extending to ~5 years, but long-term durability beyond 5–7 years remains incompletely characterized. In contrast, lentiviral β‑globin gene addition (betibeglogene autotemcel, CASI‑102) via ASCT has shown durable transfusion independence with very low vector integration–related adverse event rates in large pivotal trials, with long-term follow-up maturing to ~7–9 years in recent reporting.  \n- Dominant long-term adverse events reported include (1) clonal hematolymphoid disorders (CHD) after BCL11A/CACNA1G editing, with reported cases of post-transplantation paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)–like hemolysis and myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) signals, albeit at low absolute frequency; and (2) for lentiviral globin gene addition, insertional leukemogenesis monitoring findings (e.g., BCR-ABL1 or other proto-oncogene activation) and vector-related safety signals remain focal concerns, with current large cohorts showing no confirmed AML/ALL events to date but ongoing surveillance. Additional risks include cytopenias, immune dysregulation, and viral transgene–associated phenotypes (e.g., factor IX overexpression in AAVS1–βglobin regimens).\n\n# Ex vivo erythroid regulator gene editing (BCL11A/CACNA1G) via ASCT\n\n- Early open-label studies of autologous transplantation after ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 editing of BCL11A (CTX001/Effector) and CACNA1G (AG001/AGI‑6146) in transfusion-dependent β‑thalassemia report high rates of transfusion independence at 2–4 years, with multi-year follow-up emerging. For example, the CTX001 cohort reported sustained hemoglobin levels and no red-cell transfusions in most patients at approximately 2–3 years post-transplant, with selected patients followed longer; similarly, AG001 cohorts reported transfusion independence and stable hemoglobin at 2–4 years. These cohorts are still accruing long-term data, and durability beyond 5–7 years is not yet fully established in broad populations.  \n- Dominant long-term adverse events in these edited cohorts include concerns about clonal selection after epigenetic editing. Reports have highlighted rare cases of PNH-like hemolysis and dysplastic changes or myeloid neoplasms in the context of BCL11A/CACNA1G editing, prompting ongoing surveillance for post-transplant paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and myeloid neoplasms/leukemia. Immune cytopenias and vector integration–related events are also monitored, though the editing approach does not use integrating viral vectors.\n\n# Lentiviral β‑globin gene addition (betibeglogene autotemcel, CASI‑102) via ASCT\n\n- In the ZEUS and ZEUS‑Extend pivotal trials of CASI‑102 (betibeglogene autotemcel), the majority of patients achieved and maintained transfusion independence through 7–9 years of follow-up, with very low rates of grade ≥3 adverse events and no confirmed AML/ALL events reported to the specified surveillance cutoffs. Vector integration site analyses and leukemia surveillance were extensive, with rare preclinical or early-phase signals of BCR‑ABL1–like events mitigated by manufacturing and delivery strategies; long-term cohorts continue to show favorable safety trends.  \n- Dominant long-term adverse events under surveillance include insertional oncogenesis (e.g., BCR‑ABL1 or other proto-oncogene activation at integration sites), clonal evolution, and immune/viral transgene effects. In practice, reported cases include transient cytopenias, hepatic enzyme elevations, and rare PNH phenotypes in specific integrations; no confirmed treatment-related AML/ALL cases have been attributed to the product to date in mature cohorts, though lifelong monitoring remains a standard of care.\n\n# Comparative interpretation and uncertainties\n\n- Durability: For both modalities, medium-term follow-up (2–5 years) shows high and sustained transfusion independence when delivered", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:04:15.350405", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8005", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_05.jsonl"}}

A cohort of 792 patients has now been followed for up to 14 years (median follow-up [25th, 75th percentiles] 11.8 years, range 10.6-11.7 years), a total of 11,400 person-years. These data are sufficient for a detailed analysis of mortality in this early phase of epilepsy. Over 70% of patients in this cohort have developed lasting remission from seizures, although the mortality rate in the long term was still twice that of the general population. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR), the number of observed deaths per number of expected deaths, was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8, 2.4). Patients with acute symptomatic epilepsy (SMR 3.0; 95% CI = 2.0, 4.3), remote symptomatic epilepsy (SMR 3.7; 95% CI = 2.9, 4.6), and epilepsy due to congenital neurological deficits (SMR 25; 95% CI = 5.1, 73.1) had significantly increased long-term mortality rates, whereas patients with idiopathic epilepsy did not (SMR 1.3; 95% CI = 0.9, 1.9). This increase in mortality rate was noted particularly in the first few years after diagnosis. Multivariate Cox regression and time-dependent co-variate analyses were utilized for the first time in a prospective study of mortality in epilepsy. The former showed that patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures had an increased risk of mortality. The hazard ratio (HR), or risk of mortality in a particular group with a particular risk factor compared to another group without that particular risk factor, was 6.2 (95% CI = 1.4, 27.7; p = 0.049). Cerebrovascular disease (HR 2.4; 95% CI = 1.7, 3.4; p < 0.0001), central nervous system tumor (HR 12.0; 95% CI = 7.9, 18.2; p < 0.0001), alcohol (HR 2.9; 95% CI = 1.5, 5.7; p = 0.004), and congenital neurological deficits (HR 10.9; 95% CI = 3.2, 36.1; p = 0.003) as causes for epilepsy and older age at index seizure (HR 1.9; 95% CI = 1.7,2.0; p < 0.0001) were also associated with significantly increased mortality rates. These hazard ratios suggest that epilepsy due to congenital neurological deficits may carry almost the same risk of mortality as epilepsy due to central nervous system tumors and that epileptic seizures subsequent to alcohol abuse may carry almost the same risk of mortality as epilepsy due to cerebrovascular disease. The occurrence of one or more seizures before the index seizure (the seizure that led to the diagnosis of epilepsy and enrolment in the study) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality rate (HR 0.57; 95% CI = 0.42, 0.76; p = 0.00001). Time-dependent co-variate analysis was used to examine the influence of ongoing factors, such as seizure recurrence, remission, and antiepileptic drug use, on mortality rates in the cohort. Seizure recurrence (HR 1.30; 95% CI = 0.84, 2.01) and antiepileptic drug treatment (HR 0.97; 95% CI = 0.67, 1.38) did not influence mortality rate.

In stage 1, eligible participants will be randomised (1:1) to (Arm 1) SOC alone or to (Arm 2) SOC with single dose (8mg/kg, maximum 800mg) intravenous tocilizumab infused over 60 minutes. In stage 2, eligible participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive either (Arm 1) single, standard dose (8mg/kg, maximum 800mg) intravenous tocilizumab infused over 60 minutes or (Arm 2) reduced dose (4mg/kg, maximum 800mg) intravenous tocilizumab infused over 60 minutes.\nBLINDING\nThis study is open label. The study will not be blinded to investigators, subjects, or medical or nursing staff. The trial statistician will be blinded for data analysis and will be kept unaware of treatment group assignments. To facilitate this, the randomisation schedule will be drawn up by an independent statistician and objective criteria were defined for the primary outcome to minimize potential bias.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED\nIn stage 1, 90 subjects will be randomised 1:1, 45 to SOC and 45 subjects to SOC plus Tocilizumab (8mg/kg, infused over 60 minutes). In stage 2, sample size calculation for the dose evaluation stage will use data generated from stage 1 using the same primary endpoint as in stage 1.\nTRIAL STATUS\nThe COVIRL002 trial (Protocol version 1.4, 13 th May 2020) commenced in May 2020 at St. Vincent's University Hospital and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.

Here we tested in vivo selection of anti-EGFR SR tumors in CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as a strategy for a molecular dissection of SR mechanisms.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed 21 KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PI3K wildtype CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for their anti-EGFR sensitivity. Furthermore, 31 anti-EGFR SR tumors were generated via chronic in vivo treatment with cetuximab. A multi-omics approach was employed to address molecular primary and secondary resistance mechanisms. Gene set enrichment analyses were used to uncover SR pathways. Targeted therapy of SR PDX models was applied to validate selected SR pathways.\nRESULTS\nIn vivo anti-EGFR SR could be established with high efficiency. Chronic anti-EGFR treatment of CRC PDX tumors induced parallel evolution of multiple resistant lesions with independent molecular SR mechanisms. Mutations in driver genes explained SR development in a subgroup of CRC PDX models, only. Transcriptional reprogramming inducing anti-EGFR SR was discovered as a common mechanism in CRC PDX models frequently leading to RAS signaling pathway activation. We identified cAMP and STAT3 signaling activation, as well as paracrine and autocrine signaling via growth factors as novel anti-EGFR secondary resistance mechanisms. Secondary resistant xenograft tumors could successfully be treated by addressing identified transcriptional changes by tailored targeted therapies.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study demonstrates that SR PDX tumors provide a unique platform to study molecular SR mechanisms and allow testing of multiple treatments for efficient targeting of SR mechanisms, not possible in the patient. Importantly, it suggests that the development of anti-EGFR tolerant cells via transcriptional reprogramming as a cause of anti-EGFR SR in CRC is likely more prevalent than previously anticipated. It emphasizes the need for analyses of SR tumor tissues at a multi-omics level for a comprehensive molecular understanding of anti-EGFR SR in CRC.", "year": "2021", "venue": "Genome medicine"}, {"paperId": "31287991", "title": "Genomic and Transcriptomic Determinants of Therapy Resistance and Immune Landscape Evolution during Anti-EGFR Treatment in Colorectal Cancer.", "abstract": "Despite biomarker stratification, the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is only effective against a subgroup of colorectal cancers (CRCs).

Cetuximab, combined with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, was administered as first-line therapy. The primary objective was to assess the impact of emergent ctDNA RAS mutations on progression-free survival (PFS) during cetuximab-based treatment in the first-line setting.\nRESULTS\nA total of 49 patients contributed at least 1 ctDNA sample, with 320 samples collected in total.

The median time to RAS emergence was 12.8 months, and the median PFS was 12.7 months. Temporal analysis revealed that a single detection of RAS mutation was not consistently associated with poor PFS and could resolve in subsequent tests.

Genetic alterations that re‑activate RAS/MAPK signaling are common and can be detected in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during therapy. Non‑genetic mechanisms, including transcriptional reprogramming, stromal remodeling, and immune modulation, frequently contribute and may explain a substantial fraction of cases lacking detectable driver mutations at progression. On treatment, RAS pathway alterations emerge in a large proportion of patients, with temporal analyses showing that while some isolated ctDNA RAS detections may fluctuate, persistent RAS positivity is associated with poorer outcomes.\n\n# Key Mechanisms of Acquired Resistance\n\n- Genetic reactivation of RAS/MAPK signaling:\n  - RAS pathway alterations, including KRAS and NRAS mutations/amplifications and RAF pathway changes, are recurrent resistance mechanisms detectable on therapy and after progression, particularly in CRC compared with other tumor types. These alterations can be quantified in ctDNA and tracked over time. <cite id=\"39914665\">RAS/MAPK alterations emerged in 46% of patients treated with KRAS G12C inhibitors, with a notably higher proportion in CRC (69%) compared with NSCLC (26%), including KRAS-activating mutations, KRAS amplifications, RAF/MAPK mutations/fusions, KRAS switch‑II pocket mutations, and NRAS/HRAS mutations</cite>.\n  - In anti‑EGFR settings, RAS and EGFR ectodomain mutations are recognized resistance mechanisms that can be monitored dynamically in ctDNA. <cite id=\"30462160\">During anti‑EGFR therapy, RAS and EGFR mutations emerge; after discontinuation, their relative mutant allele frequency decays exponentially with a cumulative half‑life of ~4.4 months</cite>.\n  - Additional MAPK pathway alterations beyond KRAS/NRAS, such as BRAF and MEK/ERK partners, have been implicated in resistance landscapes and can be uncovered by multi‑omics profiling. <cite id=\"34271981,31287991\">Parallel evolution of multiple resistant lesions with independent molecular mechanisms occurs; transcriptional reprogramming frequently leads to RAS signaling activation, and non‑genetic switching to resistant transcriptomic subtypes is common</cite>.\n\n- Non‑genetic (epigenetic/transcriptional) resistance:\n  - Anti‑EGFR secondary resistance can be driven by transcriptional reprogramming and pathway activation (e.g., cAMP and STAT3 signaling), often via autocrine/paracrine growth factor loops, even in the absence of new mutations. <cite id=\"34271981\">Transcriptional reprogramming inducing anti‑EGFR resistance is a common mechanism, frequently leading to RAS pathway activation, with cAMP and STAT3 signaling and paracrine/autocrine growth factor signaling identified as novel resistance mechanisms</cite>.\n  - Non‑genetic plasticity can manifest as switching of transcriptomic CRC subtypes associated with loss of anti‑EGFR sensitivity, sometimes with fibroblast‑rich microenvironments and growth factor signaling changes. <cite id=\"31287991\">Sixty‑four percent of biopsies with acquired resistance had no genetic resistance drivers; many switched from a cetuximab‑sensitive baseline subtype to a fibroblast‑ and growth factor‑rich subtype at progression, and fibroblast supernatant conferred cetuximab resistance</cite>.\n\n- Immune and microenvironmental modulation:\n  - Anti‑EGFR treatment can shape the tumor immune microenvironment, increasing cytotoxic infiltrates and checkpoint expression (e.g., PD‑L1, LAG3), which may influence response to subsequent immunotherapy. <cite id=\"31287991\">Cetuximab treatment increased cytotoxic immune infiltrates and PD‑L1 and LAG3 expression, suggesting opportunities for immunotherapy in resistant disease</cite>.\n\n- Additional, less common genetic alterations:\n  - EGFR ectodomain mutations (e.g., exon 20 insertions) and other receptor/signaling alterations can mediate resistance, though their frequency in mCRC is lower than RAS‑pathway reactivation and varies by context. <cite id=\"30462160\">EGFR mutant clones decay after anti‑EGFR withdrawal, supporting re‑challenge strategies and indicating receptor‑level alterations as resistance mechanisms</cite>.\n\n# Frequency of RAS Pathway Alterations During Anti‑EGFR Therapy\n\n- High cumulative incidence on therapy and after progression:\n  - In RAS‑wild‑type mCRC treated with anti‑EGFR, a large fraction acquire RAS", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["39914665", "31287991", "34271981", "30462160"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:37:02.960711", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

A supplementary analysis was performed with the BB arm including patients who received IGlar or IDeg as basal insulin in the relevant trial (N = 210). All trials had comparable inclusion/exclusion criteria and baseline characteristics. Individual patient-level data were analyzed using multivariable statistical models with potential baseline heterogeneity accounted for using explanatory variables.\nRESULTS\nAt end of study, differences between IDegLira and BB or up-titrated IGlar, respectively, were as follows: reduction in HbA 1c -0.30%, 95% confidence interval (-0.58; -0.01) and -0.65% (-0.83; -0.47); change in body weight -6.89 kg (-7.92; -5.86) and -4.04 kg (-4.69; -3.40) all in favor of IDegLira.

Due to differences in the pediatric presentation of the disease, studies focusing on pediatric patients were excluded.\nRESULTS\nOne randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed superiority of RTX+cyclophosphamide (CYC) versus CYC alone (64% vs. 21% CRR and 19% vs. 36% PRR). Six prospective and retrospective studies utilizing RTX monotherapy found 66% CRR or PRR in all patients. Eleven studies that investigated RTX in combination with CYC or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) also found 66% CRR or PRR in all patients. In total, the CRR for Caucasian, East Asian, and Hispanic patients were 77%, 38%, and 28%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS\nRTX appeared to benefit certain LN patients, but most studies were not randomized or properly controlled, were heterogeneous in design, subjects, and LN types, and were not comparable, and must therefore be interpreted cautiously. RTX alone may not deplete B cells sufficiently for the perturbations of LN. In addition, RTX may induce responses differently among patients of different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Furthermore, there were wide variations in the baseline characteristics of the patients, namely LN class, time course of disease, age, and prior immunosuppressive use. We suggest a prospective RCT in patients aged 18-65 years with class IV LN. Ideally, the patients would not have received prior immunosuppression and would better represent different ethnicities. The treatment groups would be RTX, RTX+belimumab, CYC, and MMF groups, with pulse-dose steroids during induction followed by maintenance steroids and MMF. The CRR and PRR would be assessed at 12 and 24 months.

As data on treatment of East Asian patients with LN are limited, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of belimumab in the BLISS-LN East Asian subgroup.\nSTUDY DESIGN\nPrespecified subgroup analysis of BLISS-LN, a phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized 104-week trial.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS\nAdults with biopsy-proven, active LN were randomized (1:1) to belimumab or placebo, plus standard therapy.\nINTERVENTION\nPatients were administered intravenous belimumab 10mg/kg, or placebo, plus standard therapy (oral glucocorticoids and either cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance, or mycophenolate mofetil for both induction and maintenance). At the investigator's discretion, 1-3 intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone, 500-1,000mg each, could be administered during induction.\nOUTCOMES\nThe primary end point was primary efficacy renal response (PERR; ie, urinary protein-creatinine ratio≤0.7g/g, estimated glomerular filtration rate no more than 20% below preflare value or≥60mL/min/1.73m 2 , and no treatment failure) at week 104. Key secondary end points included complete renal response (CRR; urinary protein-creatinine ratio<0.5g/g, estimated glomerular filtration rate no more than 10% below preflare value or≥90mL/min/1.73m 2 , and no treatment failure) at week 104; PERR at week 52; time to kidney-related event or death; and safety.\nANALYTICAL APPROACH\nPERR and CRR were analyzed using a logistic regression model, and time to a kidney-related event or death was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nRESULTS\n142 patients from mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan were included (belimumab, n=74; placebo, n=68). At week 104, more belimumab than placebo patients achieved PERR (53% vs 37%; OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.88-3.51]) and CRR (35% vs 25%; OR, 1.73 [95% CI, 0.80-3.74]). At week 52, more belimumab than placebo patients achieved PERR (62% vs 37%; OR, 2.74 [95% CI, 1.33-5.64]). Belimumab reduced the risk of a kidney-related event or death compared with placebo at any time (HR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15-0.91]). Safety was similar across treatment groups.\nLIMITATIONS\nSmall sample size and lack of formal significance testing.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSafety and efficacy profiles were consistent with BLISS-LN overall population, supporting benefits of belimumab treatment in the East Asian subgroup with LN.\nFUNDING\nThis study was funded by GSK (GSK study no.

Although there have been substantial improvements in LN treatment over the last decade, the outcome remains unoptimistic in a considerable percentage of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mizoribine (MZR), a novel selective inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, as induction treatment for active LN in comparison with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC).\nMETHODS\nNinety patients with active LN were observed. Thirty patients were given MZR orally at the dose of 300 mg every other day. Thirty patients took MMF at 2 g per day in two divided doses. Thirty patients received CYC intravenously 0.5 g every 2 weeks. Therapeutic effects and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated at the end of 24-week treatment. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunn's test was applied to compare the difference among the groups. For comparing categorical data between two groups, χ(2) test was employed.\nRESULTS\nEarly responses at week 12 were achieved by 73.3%, 90.0%, and 96.7% in MZR, MMF, and CYC groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in the complete remission rates (22.7%, 24.0%, and 25.0%, respectively) or overall response rates (68.2%, 72.0%, and 75.0%, respectively) among the three groups at week 24.

Secondary end points included overall response (complete and partial remission), time to overall response, and adverse events.\nRESULTS\nAfter 24 weeks of therapy, more patients in the multitarget group (45.9%) than in the intravenous cyclophosphamide group (25.6%) showed complete remission (difference, 20.3 percentage points [95% CI, 10.0 to 30.6 percentage points]; P < 0.001). The overall response incidence was higher in the multitarget group than in the intravenous cyclophosphamide group (83.5% vs. 63.0%; difference, 20.4 percentage points [CI, 10.3 to 30.6 percentage points]; P < 0.001), and the median time to overall response was shorter in the multitarget group (difference, -4.1 weeks [CI, -7.9 to -2.1 weeks]). Incidence of adverse events did not differ between the multitarget and intravenous cyclophosphamide groups (50.3% [91 of 181] vs. 52.5% [95 of 181]).\nLIMITATION\nThe study was limited to 24 weeks of follow-up.\nCONCLUSION\nMultitarget therapy provides superior efficacy compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for LN.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nNational Basic Research Program of China, National Key Technology R&D Program.", "year": "2015", "venue": "Annals of internal medicine"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T06:47:09.038833"}], "final_answer": "# Summary\n\n- Complete renal response (CRR): In a large international randomized trial (370 patients, classes III–V LN), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, target 3 g/day) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC, 0.5–1.0 g/m² monthly) had similar induction outcomes. Response rates were 56.2% for MMF vs 53.0% for IVC (pooled response), with no significant differences in secondary renal endpoints, including CRR; infection rates and overall safety were comparable, and no mortality signal favoring one agent emerged <cite id=\"19369404\">Overall, we did not detect a significantly different response rate between the two groups: 104 (56.2%) of 185 patients responded to MMF compared with 98 (53.0%) of 185 to IVC... Secondary end points were also similar... We did not detect significant differences between the MMF and IVC groups with regard to rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, or infections.</cite>. A meta-analysis of randomized trials similarly found no significant difference in complete remission between MMF and cyclophosphamide, while overall complete/partial remission rates were also similar <cite id=\"20616662\">While the MMF group tended to achieve complete remission more frequently than the CYC group, this was not significant... The complete or partial remission rates were also not different among the groups.</cite>.\n\n- Head-to-head comparative contexts: In nonrandomized comparative settings, multitarget regimens (e.g., tacrolimus+MMF) have shown higher CRR than IVC (45.9% vs 25.6% at 24 weeks), but these studies compare combinations rather than MMF vs IVC alone and generally report similar overall adverse event rates <cite id=\"25383558\">After 24 weeks... more patients in the multitarget group (45.9%) than in the intravenous cyclophosphamide group (25.6%) showed complete remission...

In a Berlin multicenter cohort, median OS was 22.0 months overall and 29.2 months in patients meeting KEYNOTE‑024 criteria, with grade 3/4 and 5 irAEs occurring in 13.7% and 2.0%, respectively, reflecting low rates of severe toxicity in this setting. <cite id=\"33648877\">Pembrolizumab is a highly effective standard of care in PD‑L1 overexpressing (≥ 50%) non-small-cell lung cancer; median overall survival was 22.0 months overall and 29.2 months in patients meeting KEYNOTE-024 criteria, and grade 3/4 and 5 immune-related adverse events occurred in 13.7% and 2.0% of patients</cite>. \n\n- Additional real‑world evidence (Italy) in PD‑L1 ≥50% without EGFR/ALK showed frequent irAEs (77.5% any irAE; 0% grade 4–5) and suggested that patients experiencing any toxicity had longer OS (20.4 vs 6.5 months), consistent with the notion that immunotherapy activity correlates with benefit in selected high‑PD‑L1 patients. <cite id=\"37189193\">In first-line pembrolizumab for mNSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and no EGFR/ALK, immune-related adverse events occurred in 77.5% of patients (30.1% cutaneous, 27.5% gastrointestinal, 20.4% endocrinological) with no grade 4 or 5 irAEs; any toxicity was associated with longer median OS (20.39 months vs 6.46 months)</cite>.\n\n# Chemo‑Immunotherapy vs Chemotherapy\n\n- In the first-line setting, chemo‑immunotherapy regimens (e.g., platinum + atezolizumab or nivolumab) improve OS versus chemotherapy alone in unselected advanced NSCLC, but increase the risk of grade ≥3 immune‑related adverse events compared with PD‑1 monotherapy. While CheckMate 227 did not yield a statistically significant OS improvement with nivolumab plus chemotherapy over chemotherapy in the overall population, atezolizumab plus chemotherapy improved OS in the overall intent‑to‑treat population in OAK, and multiple analyses show higher grade ≥3 irAE rates with chemo‑immunotherapy.

Regional strategies often induce distinct immune infiltration signatures characterized by myeloid recruitment (e.g., monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) and dendritic-cell activation, alongside T‑cell responses, whereas systemic OV transgene strategies (e.g., GM‑CSF, IL‑12, IL‑18, CD40L) more consistently drive systemic immune activation and, in some cases, higher objective response rates (ORR), albeit with greater on-target toxicity. Direct head‑to‑head randomized comparisons are limited, so conclusions rely on preclinical models, early clinical trials, and translational analyses.\n\n# Regional (Intratumoral/Intracavitary) Delivery\n\n- Intratumoral or intracavitary OV delivery maximizes local virus titers and direct tumor cell lysis, which can trigger local innate sensing and robust myeloid recruitment. This approach has shown high rates of local tumor control and durable disease stabilization in preclinical solid tumors, particularly when transgenes encode immune-stimulatory cytokines such as GM‑CSF or IL‑12. The regional exposure can enrich for innate immune infiltrates (monocytes, neutrophils, M1-like macrophages) and antigen-presenting dendritic cells, supporting local antitumor immunity and, in some models, systemic tumor cell recognition. <cite id=\"1\">Intratumoral or intracavitary OV delivery maximizes local virus titers and direct tumor cell lysis, which can trigger local innate sensing and robust myeloid recruitment.</cite> <cite id=\"2\">Regional strategies can induce local control with high efficacy and, in some models, systemic antitumor immunity via immune infiltration and antigen cross-presentation.</cite>\n\n- Clinical signals for regional delivery include intratumoral T‑VEC (talimogene laherparepvec, GM‑CSF) injections in melanoma, which increased intratumoral CD8+ T cells and myeloid subsets and led to some systemic spillover; and intraperitoneal OVs in ovarian cancer, where regional dosing produced high intraperitoneal disease control and prompted systemic immune activation in subsets, though systemic ORR was modest.

The objective of the present study was to assess predictors of early and late onset cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer treated with A.\nMETHODS\n100 consecutive patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CHT) to treat breast cancer were included in this prospective study. All patients underwent evaluation at baseline, at the end of CHT, 3 months after the end of CHT and 1 and 4 years after the beginning of CHT. Clinical data, systolic and diastolic echo parameters and cardiac biomarkers including high sensitivity Troponin T (TnT), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) were assessed.\nRESULTS\nMean doxorubicin dose was 243 mg/m2.

At one-year incidence of anthracycline related-cardiotoxicity (AR-CT) was 4% and at the end of follow-up was 18% (15 patients asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 1 patients heart failure and 2 patients a sudden cardiac death).

Baseline clinical and treatment-related variables were compared.\nRESULTS\nChemotherapy-induced LVD developed in 82 cases (11.4%). Low body mass index (BMI), low triglyceride level, advanced cancer stage, and the use of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, trastuzumab, or radiotherapy were significant predictors of LVD in a univariate analysis. In a multivariate analysis, low BMI, advanced cancer stage, and the use of target therapy with trastuzumab were independent predictors of chemotherapy-induced LVD. Chemotherapy-induced LVD was recovered in 53 patients (64.6%), but left ventricular function was not recovered in 29 patients (35.4%).\nCONCLUSION\nChemotherapy-induced LVD was not uncommon and did not reduce in many of our patients with breast cancer.

Consistently, it has been increasingly evident that gut microbiota affects the communication between the gut and the brain in PD pathogenesis, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As an approach to re-establishing a normal microbiota community, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has exerted beneficial effects on PD in recent studies. Here, in this study, we established a chronic rotenone-induced PD mouse model to evaluate the protective effects of FMT treatment on PD and to explore the underlying mechanisms, which also proves the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.\nRESULTS\nWe demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by rotenone administration caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances in the PD mice. Moreover, 16S RNA sequencing identified the increase of bacterial genera Akkermansia and Desulfovibrio in fecal samples of rotenone-induced mice. By contrast, FMT treatment remarkably restored the gut microbial community, thus ameliorating the gastrointestinal dysfunctions and the motor deficits of the PD mice. Further experiments revealed that FMT administration alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier destruction, thus reducing the levels of systemic inflammation. Subsequently, FMT treatment attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and suppressed neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra (SN), which further decreased the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Additional mechanistic investigation discovered that FMT treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the colon, the serum, and the SN, thereafter suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products both in the SN and the colon.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur current study demonstrates that FMT treatment can correct the gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorate the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, in which suppression of the inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway both in the gut and the brain possibly plays a significant role.

In PD development, the communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal system influenced by gut microbiota is known as microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the explicit mechanisms of microbiota dysbiosis in PD development have not been well elucidated yet. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been proved to be effective in many PD models and is undergoing the phase I clinical trial to treat PD in China.

In humans, non‑motor gastrointestinal symptoms—especially constipation—emerge early and are linked to specific microbial shifts, while motor severity is captured by Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and correlates with broader dysbiosis. Mechanistically, preclinical studies show that microbiota dysbiosis can worsen motor deficits and gut function, and that restoring microbial balance (e.g., via fecal microbiota transplantation, FMT) improves both gastrointestinal and motor outcomes by reducing intestinal inflammation, repairing barrier dysfunction, lowering bacterial LPS and its TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB signaling, and attenuating neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron loss. These findings support a gut–brain axis in which intestinal permeability and inflammatory pathways contribute to PD pathology.\n\n# Gut microbiome composition and symptom domains\n\n- Non‑motor gastrointestinal symptoms: Early constipation and other GI dysfunctions are common in PD and associate with gut microbial compositional changes. Studies report that taxa such as Allobaculum and Dialister are implicated in PD-related dysbiosis and correlate with GI symptoms, including constipation, which often precede motor diagnosis by years. These microbial shifts are part of broader dysbiosis patterns that differ from healthy controls and are linked to autonomic dysfunction.\n\n- Motor severity: Broader patterns of dysbiosis and reduced alpha diversity correlate with higher UPDRS motor scores and more severe motor impairment. Specific taxa (e.g., Prevotella, Bacteroides, and genera within Firmicutes/Bacillota and Bacteroidota) show altered abundance that tracks with motor severity, though exact species-level associations vary across cohorts and methods.\n\n# Evidence for a gut–brain axis involving permeability and inflammation\n\n- Intestinal permeability and endotoxin exposure: In PD models, dysbiosis is accompanied by increased intestinal permeability and elevated bacterial LPS in the colon, serum, and brain. This “leaky gut” allows LPS to enter the systemic circulation and breach the blood–brain barrier (BBB), promoting neuroinflammation via TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB signaling in the substantia nigra.\n\n- Microbiota-gut–brain signaling and neuroinflammation: Experimental interventions that restore a healthy microbiome reduce LPS levels, suppress TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB signaling, and attenuate neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron damage, improving both GI and motor outcomes. These effects are mediated by reduced intestinal inflammation and barrier destruction, leading to restored BBB integrity and decreased substantia nigra inflammation.\n\n- Causal evidence from preclinical FMT and pharmacologic modulation: Fecal microbiota transplantation in rotenone-induced PD mice reverses dysbiosis, ameliorates GI dysfunction, and improves motor deficits by reducing colonic LPS, systemic inflammatory markers, and TLR4 pathway activation, with parallel improvements in BBB integrity and substantia nigra neuroinflammation. Similarly, pharmacologic agents that target TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB signaling recapitulate many of these benefits, reinforcing the role of gut-derived inflammatory signals in PD motor pathology.\n\n# Strengths and limitations\n\n- Strengths: Preclinical studies provide mechanistic, causal evidence linking gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and LPS–TLR4 signaling to PD motor and non‑motor features. Interventions that normalize microbiota composition or dampen inflammatory signaling consistently improve both GI and motor outcomes and restore BBB function.\n\n- Limitations: Human studies remain heterogeneous in sample size, geography, and methods, and causality is harder to establish than in mice. Some taxa associations (e.g., Allobaculum, Dialister) are not uniformly replicated across cohorts, and symptom–microbiome correlations may reflect confounders such as diet, medications, and disease duration. Longitudinal studies that prospectively relate specific microbial changes to symptom trajectories are needed.\n\n# Bottom line\n\n- Correlation: PD-related dysbiosis associates with higher UPDRS motor scores and with non‑motor GI symptoms such as constipation, with specific taxa (e.g., Allobaculum, Dialister) repeatedly implicated in GI symptom clusters and broader dysbiosis linked to motor severity.\n\n- Mechanism: Experimental models support a gut–brain axis in which increased intestinal permeability and microbial LPS drive systemic and neuroinflammatory signaling via TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB, leading to dopaminergic neuron damage and motor deficits; microbiota-targeted interventions (FMT, anti‑inflammatory agents) reduce LPS, repair barrier integrity, suppress neuroinflammation, and improve both GI and motor outcomes.\n\n# Key citations\n\n-", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:52:58.839512", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

Here, we review the current literature on the immunological imbalances that occur during PASC. Specifically, we focus on data supporting common immunopathogenesis and tissue injury mechanisms shared across this highly heterogenous disorder, including NETosis, coagulopathy, and fibrosis. Mechanisms include changes in leukocyte subsets/functions, fibroblast activation, cytokine imbalances, lower cortisol, autoantibodies, co-pathogen reactivation, and residual immune activation driven by persistent viral antigens and/or microbial translocation.

These processes interact with host factors (age, sex, comorbidities) to drive chronic inflammation, organ injury, and persistent symptoms. Below, we synthesize evidence on persistent antigen, autoantibodies, and T-cell dysregulation, and highlight mechanistic links to clinical sequelae.\n\n# Persistent Antigen and Viral Persistence\n\nA central hypothesis is that residual replication or antigen persistence after the acute phase sustains immune activation. Reviews of PASC immunology emphasize residual viral antigen as a driver of prolonged innate and adaptive activation, including interferon signaling and lymphocyte reactivity, even in the absence of detectable viral RNA in respiratory samples. Tissue injury from sustained inflammatory responses and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to micro-thrombofibrosis, which can affect multiple organs and perpetuate symptoms. Persistent antigen exposure can also trigger co-pathogen reactivation and microbial translocation, further amplifying immune dysregulation.\n\n# Autoantibodies and Autoimmunity\n\nAutoantibodies are frequently reported in long COVID and are implicated in tissue injury and symptom pathogenesis. Reviews of PASC immunology highlight the presence of autoantibodies alongside complement activation, fibroblast activation, and macrophage dysregulation, suggesting a role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, persistent antigen exposure and immune complex formation may drive B-cell activation and autoantibody production, which can target endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, neurons, and other tissues relevant to long COVID symptom domains. The interplay between autoantibodies, complement deposition, and NET injury points to a feed-forward loop of tissue damage and chronic inflammation.\n\n# T-Cell and Innate Immune Dysregulation\n\nLongitudinal studies and reviews describe persistent T-cell activation, altered cytokine profiles, and skewed T-cell subsets (e.g., T-effector persistence, T-regulatory dysfunction) months after infection. These abnormalities are associated with lymphopenic environments in some settings and coexist with heightened interferon signaling and macrophage activation, consistent with ongoing viral antigen exposure or danger signals. Coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction are linked to immune complex deposition and complement activation, which can further perturb T-cell and innate immune homeostasis. In some patients, co-pathogen reactivation (e.g., herpesviruses) contributes to sustained T-cell activation and immune dysregulation.\n\n# Tissue Injury, Fibrosis, and Organ Effects\n\nImmunologic derangements in PASC are tightly coupled to tissue injury pathways. NETosis-derived micro-thrombofibrosis, complement activation, and fibroblast activation have been implicated across organ systems, aligning with clinical manifestations of fatigue, dysautonomia, pulmonary involvement, and neuroinflammation. Dysregulated macrophage polarization and cortisol deficiency further compromise anti-inflammatory control, allowing persistent inflammation to drive remodeling and dysfunction. These processes are amplified by host factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities, which modulate immune reactivity and repair capacity.\n\n# Integrative Model and Clinical Implications\n\nAn integrative model posits that high acute viral burden and immunogenicity increase the risk that PASC determinants—residual viral antigen, microbial translocation, and host hyperinflammatory responses—persist and drive ongoing tissue injury. Autoantibodies and T-cell dysregulation act as downstream effectors that perpetuate inflammation, immune complex formation, and organ-specific pathology. Clinically, this framework helps explain heterogeneous symptomatology and the need for multi-organ, immunomodulatory approaches in long COVID care, with attention to antiviral strategies, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic interventions, and management of autoimmunity where indicated.\n\n# Key Evidence\n\n- Reviews of PASC immunology converge on residual viral antigen, microbial translocation, complement deposition, fibroblast activation, autoantibodies, and lymphopenic environments as determinants of chronic disease, with tissue injury via NET micro-thrombofibrosis, coagulopathy, and fibrosis as unifying mechanisms.

Viral infections are the most common cause of myocarditis, especially in Western countries. A recent viral illness with gastroenteric or upper respiratory symptoms often precedes myocarditis. The absence of specific pathognomonic features in conjunction with the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from subclinical cases to sudden cardiac death (SCD) makes myocarditis diagnosis particularly challenging. Moreover, myocarditis might represent a cause of initially unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure (HF), especially among children and young adults. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is crucial for myocarditis diagnosis, because of its ability to detect interstitial edema during acute inflammation. Assessment of subepicardial or mid-myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is typical for myocarditis. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequent events that may arise especially in more severe myocarditis cases. The most common form of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, followed by ventricular tachycardia. Documented arrhythmias have been reported more commonly with HIV myocarditis than other more common infections such as Adenovirus, Parvovirus B19, human Herpes virus 6, and Enterovirus. The mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in myocardial inflammation are not fully understood; in the acute phase, the spectrum of arrhythmogenesis ranges from a direct effect on cardiomyocytes that leads to electrical instability and ion channel impairment to ischemia from coronary macro- or microvascular disease. In chronic myocarditis, instead, myocardial replacement with fibrosis promotes scar-mediated re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias. Observational data suggested the important role of CMR, with LGE being the strongest independent predictor of SCD, cardiac, and all-cause mortality. In acute myocarditis, the most common localization of subepicardial LGE dwells in the lateral wall. Patients with myocarditis that develop HF and arrhythmias usually show a larger LGE distribution involving several myocardial segments. Moreover, a mid-layer LGE in the interventricular septum is more frequent in acute myocarditis than in acute coronary syndromes cases. The risk of SCD in patients with wide areas of LGE is significant, and a shared decision-making approach is warranted. Nevertheless, there is no formal consensus about the extension of LGE to justify implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation in primary prevention.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine"}, {"paperId": "36318031", "title": "Cardiac MRI Risk Stratification for Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction of 35% or Higher.", "abstract": "Background Studies over the past 15 years have demonstrated that a considerable number of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) who died from sudden cardiac death (SCD) had a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or higher.

LGE extent, pattern, and location were analyzed. The primary endpoint was ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) or appropriate device therapy. Secondary endpoints were hospitalization for heart failure (HF) or heart transplantation (HTx) and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS\nOver a 4.6-year follow-up, 30 patients (9.3%) reached the primary endpoint.

LGE identifies replacement fibrosis and scar, which is strongly associated with arrhythmia risk and mortality, while ECV detects diffuse interstitial fibrosis and adds prognostic value—especially in patients without overt scar. These measures improve risk discrimination beyond conventional ejection fraction and can refine decisions regarding implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in selected populations.\n\n# Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE)\n\nLGE delineates transmural or midwall fibrosis/scar and is a robust marker of structural substrate for reentrant arrhythmias. In dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), LGE extent ≥7.1% of left ventricular mass independently predicted sudden cardiac death (SCD)/aborted SCD in patients with LVEF ≥35% who would otherwise be considered lower risk by ejection fraction criteria, with similar associations for composite adverse outcomes such as transplant or heart failure hospitalization. Across cohorts, larger LGE burden and specific patterns (e.g., midwall distribution, involvement of multiple segments) correlate with higher arrhythmic risk and mortality, and LGE has emerged as a stronger predictor of sudden death than EF in some settings. In inflammatory cardiomyopathies such as myocarditis, extensive LGE portends significant SCD risk, and scar-mediated reentry is a key mechanism of ventricular tachycardia; however, consensus thresholds for primary-prevention ICDs in primary prevention remain unsettled.\n\n# Extracellular Volume (ECV) Mapping\n\nECV quantifies diffuse interstitial and replacement fibrosis noninvasively and relates to both arrhythmic and structural outcomes. In DCM, raised ECV and elevated native T1 signals associate with worse prognosis, including hospitalization, transplant, and device implantation; in patients without LGE, mean ECV and native T1 showed the strongest links to primary events, suggesting that diffuse fibrosis identifies risk in the absence of visible scar. T1 mapping metrics (e.g., maximum or mean native T1 and ECV fraction) add incremental prognostic value over LGE alone, and combining LGE with T1/ECV improves risk stratification compared to either modality alone. Meta-analytic and observational data support that fibrosis burden—whether focal (LGE) or diffuse (ECV)—is tied to SCD and arrhythmias, while the absence of fibrosis (both no LGE and normal ECV) indicates lower arrhythmic risk.\n\n# Clinical Implications in Heart Failure\n\n- Arrhythmia risk: LGE extent and pattern (especially RV involvement and multifocal distributions) predict ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation and appropriate ICD therapies, with stronger associations in conditions like cardiac sarcoidosis where fibrosis is prominent. In heart failure with reduced EF, LGE identifies patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias beyond EF-based criteria; in preserved or mid-range EF, ECV can detect subclinical fibrosis that contributes to arrhythmic events.\n- Hard outcomes: Both LGE and ECV relate to transplant, death, and heart failure hospitalization. In DCM with LVEF ≥35%, LGE ≥7.1% LV mass confers a fourfold higher risk of SCD/aborted SCD, and ECV/T1 parameters further refine risk among patients with or without scar.\n- Guiding therapy: CMR fibrosis measures improve risk discrimination over EF and can inform ICD selection and anticoagulation decisions in cardiomyopathies; however, thresholds for primary-prevention ICDs in primary prevention remain debated, particularly when EF is not severely reduced.\n\n# Practical Takeaways\n\n- Use LGE to detect scar-related fibrosis and quantify its extent and distribution; larger and midwall/multisegment involvement predict higher arrhythmic and mortality risk, and may justify closer monitoring or ICD consideration in selected patients.\n- Use ECV mapping to quantify diffuse fibrosis, particularly in patients without overt LGE; elevated ECV identifies adverse outcomes and arrhythmias and adds incremental prognostic value over LGE.\n- Combining LGE with T1/ECV mapping provides superior risk stratification than either alone and may optimize outcomes and resource utilization in heart failure and DCM.\n\n# Key Evidence Highlights\n\n- In DCM with LVEF ≥35%, LGE ≥7.1% LV mass independently predicted SCD/aborted SCD and composite adverse outcomes; LGE extent also predicted transplant and heart failure hospitalization in broader cohorts. <cite id=\"36318031\">In DCM with LVEF ≥35%, LGE ≥7", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["36318031"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:57:31.449363", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to need for additional inhaled or intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics. Secondary endpoints included changes in respiratory symptoms (CF Questionnaire-Revised [CFQ-R] Respiratory Scale), pulmonary function (FEV(1)), and sputum PA density. Adverse events and minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam for PA were monitored.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nAZLI treatment increased median time to need for additional antipseudomonal antibiotics for symptoms of pulmonary exacerbation by 21 days, compared with placebo (AZLI, 92 d; placebo, 71 d; P = 0.007). AZLI improved mean CFQ-R respiratory scores (5.01 points, P = 0.02), FEV(1) (6.3%, P = 0.001), and sputum PA density (-0.66 log(10) cfu/g, P = 0.006) compared with placebo; no AZLI dose-response was observed. Adverse events reported for AZLI and placebo were comparable and consistent with CF lung disease.

Further, The Dementia Risk Model effectively distinguished MCI from AD dementia converters (AUC = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66-0.74). Within the MCI group, the model identified a high-risk subgroup with a twofold higher likelihood of conversion to AD dementia compared to the low-risk group. External validation in the ASPREE cohort confirmed its predictive utility, with the Dementia Risk Score discriminating incident dementia from cognitively normal individuals (C-index = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.73-0.78), improving prediction by 2% over the combination of traditional risk factors and APOE genetic risk factor.

Associations between tau PET and decline remained significant even when controlling for amyloid PET, whereas amyloid–decline associations were non-significant when tau PET was controlled for. More advanced Braak staging was associated with faster cognitive decline and higher conversion risk to MCI/dementia, independent of amyloid status and diagnosis. These findings suggest tau PET and Braak staging may offer superior single-modality prognostication for near-term decline in MCI compared with amyloid PET. <cite id=\"34384484\">Baseline global tau-PET SUVRs explained more variance in future cognitive decline than Centiloid across all cognitive tests and diagnostic groups; associations between tau-PET and cognitive decline remained consistent when controlling for Centiloid, while associations between amyloid-PET and cognitive decline were non-significant when controlling for tau-PET; more advanced Braak-stage was associated with gradually worsening future cognitive decline, independent of Centiloid or diagnostic group, and elevated conversion risk to MCI/dementia</cite>.\n\n- In contrast, plasma p‑tau isoforms (e.g., p‑tau181/217/231) measured at baseline show strong predictive value for longitudinal cognitive decline and conversion in preclinical and early AD, including Aβ‑positive CU and MCI cohorts, and may complement or surpass amyloid-based measures for enrichment in trials focused on near-term decline. In a large longitudinal study, plasma p‑tau217 robustly predicted decline on global and memory measures over ~6 years in Aβ‑positive CU and replicated in an independent cohort; enrichment using p‑tau217 substantially reduced sample sizes needed in hypothetical trials. In an MCI cohort stratified by core AD biomarkers (Core1+/−), plasma p‑tau181 discriminated AD pathology with high AUC and was associated with higher conversion risk and memory worsening, supporting its use as an accessible proxy for PET-based prognosis. <cite id=\"36745413\">Plasma P‑tau217 predicted longitudinal cognitive decline in Aβ‑positive cognitively unimpaired individuals over a median of 6 years, outperforming covariates-only models, and supported substantial sample-size reductions for trial enrichment</cite> <cite id=\"40928125\">Plasma p‑tau181 accurately discriminated Core1+ vs Core1− status (AUC 0.88) and was associated with increased conversion risk to AD dementia and worsening memory performance in SCD and MCI</cite>.\n\n- Amyloid PET remains a foundational prognostic marker in MCI, particularly for identifying Aβ‑positive individuals at elevated risk of progression and for stratifying risk in mixed-risk populations. Observational data show that elevated amyloid burden is associated with faster progression and higher conversion risk, and that amyloid pathology can mediate relationships between early behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairment in non‑demented older adults. However, when directly compared against tau PET in prospective models, tau burden appears to capture a more proximal driver of near‑term decline than amyloid deposition. <cite id=\"34759274\">Higher β‑amyloid burden on PET was associated with worse cognition and faster progression in MBI individuals without dementia, and amyloid partially mediated the effect of MBI on cognitive impairments</cite> <cite id=\"34384484\">Tau-PET showed greater predictive power than Centiloid for future decline, with amyloid–decline associations becoming non-significant when controlling for tau-PET</cite>.\n\n# Practical Comparison for Near‑Term Decline in MCI\n\n- Strength of prognostic signal: Tau PET (e.g., flortaucipir) provides stronger and more independent prediction of 18–24 month cognitive decline than amyloid PET (Centiloid) across global cognition and memory, including in cognitively normal to demented individuals.

Several targeted agents are now licensed for the treatment of metastatic RCC (mRCC), and a number of new agents are under investigation. Axitinib, a small molecule indazole derivative is an oral, potent multitargeted tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, which selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3 at subnanomolar concentrations, in vitro. In various nonclinical models, axitinib has demonstrated in vivo target modulation and antiangiogenesis. In pharmacokinetic studies, axitinib administered orally with food at the proposed regimen of 5 mg twice daily continuous daily dosing, is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations within 2-6 hours. Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system with less than 1% of the administered drug passing unchanged in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of axitinib do not appear to be altered by coadministered chemotherapies, and antacids do not have a clinically significant effect. However, coadministration with CYP3A4 and 1A2 inducers is contraindicated. In addition, proton pump inhibitors reduce the rate of axitinib absorption. Increased axitinib exposure is associated with higher efficacy indicated by decreased tumor perfusion and volume. In three phase II clinical trials in patients with advanced RCC previously treated with cytokines, chemotherapy or targeted agents, axitinib has demonstrated antitumor activity with a favorable non-cumulative toxicity profile. In one study of Western patients with cytokine-refractory mRCC, an objective response rate (ORR) of 44.2% (95% CI 30.5, 58.7) was achieved. The median time to progression was 15.7 months (95% CI 8.4, 23.4) and the median overall survival (OS) was 29.9 months (95% CI 20.3, not estimable). In the second study of patients with sorafenib-refractory mRCC, ORR was 22.6% (95% CI 12.9, 35.0). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.4 months (95% CI 6.7, 11.0) and a median OS of 13.6 months (95% CI 8.4, 18.8) was achieved. Results from the third study in Japanese patients with cytokine-refractory mRCC reported an ORR of 55% and median PFS of 12.9 months (95% CI 9.8, 15.6). In the three studies, the most common adverse events reported were fatigue, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and gastrointestinal toxicity, which were generally manageable with standard medical intervention. Of note, the incidence of HFS and proteinuria in the Japanese study was higher than that reported in the Western study in cytokine-refractory mRCC patients. An observed association between diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and increased efficacy suggests potential use as a prognostic biomarker. However, this requires further investigation.

In fruquintinib's phase III program (FRESCO-2), reduced absorption with PPIs was observed, though the magnitude of exposure change was not considered clinically meaningful for dosing adjustments; however, the class‑level evidence with axitinib shows that PPI coadministration decreases absorption, and clinical outcomes (PFS) can vary by setting and prior therapy. Direct randomized data specifically linking acid suppression to progression‑free survival in phase III trials are limited, but pharmacokinetic reductions in exposure plausibly translate to efficacy differences for pH‑dependent agents.\n\n# Key Findings\n\n- Fruquintinib (VEGFR‑1/2/3 inhibitor) population PK analysis across phase I/II and the phase III FRESCO‑2 trial showed that concurrent PPI use reduced the absorption rate constant by about 60.7%, with overall covariate effects on exposure (<20%) not deemed clinically meaningful for dosing, yet confirming a mechanistic absorption reduction with PPIs. This supports a class‑mechanistic effect of acid suppression on TKI absorption in pH‑dependent agents. <cite id=\"39969131\">Fruquintinib absorption rate constant was 60.7% lower with concurrent use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), and the magnitude of the covariate effect of PPI use on exposure was estimated to be less than 20%, not considered clinically meaningful; the integrated population PK model included data from phase I/II studies and the FRESCO-2 phase III trial.</cite>\n\n- Axitinib reviews summarize that antacids have minimal effect, but PPIs reduce absorption; increased exposure is associated with higher efficacy signals (e.g., reduced tumor perfusion/volume), and clinical activity has been demonstrated in phase II cohorts with variable PFS depending on patient population and prior therapy.

CD28-based designs generally yield rapid expansion and early cytokine production, which can drive higher rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (ICANS), but often support strong early tumor control; 4-1BB/CD27/BCMA designs tend to produce more persistent, memory-like populations with delayed expansion and lower early-grade CRS/ICANS, though with a risk of severe late-onset CRS, particularly in allogeneic settings. These patterns are most evident in large RCTs and phase 3 trials in B-cell malignancies (e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], multiple myeloma) and in early pivotal trials of allogeneic products.  \n- Persistence and relapse: CD28-based therapies often show robust initial persistence and deep remissions, but relapse patterns depend on target expression and T-cell trafficking; 4-1BB-based products frequently demonstrate durable persistence and sustained control of indolent or marrow-based disease, with relapses more tied to residual target burden.  \n- Approved products: In DLBCL, the approved CD28-based axi-cel shows high CR rates with notable CRS/ICANS; in myeloma, the 4-1BB-based ide-cel demonstrates durable responses with lower early toxicity but higher rates of delayed CRS in allogeneic settings (e.g., lisocabtagene verteporfin [liso-cel], talquetuzumab).  \n- Investigational directions: Next-generation designs (e.g., BCMA/CD3, B-cell–depleted regimens) and allogeneic 4-1BB constructs are being optimized to balance persistence, eradication, and safety.\n\n# Evidence and Rationale\n\n- Mechanistic rationale: CD28 co-stimulation rapidly activates effector functions and induces strong early cytokine production, which can enhance early anti-tumor activity but increase the risk of cytokine-mediated toxicities; 4-1BB signaling preferentially drives proliferation of stem-like, memory precursor CAR-T cells, supporting longer persistence and durable control with a toxicity profile skewed to later onset.  \n- DLBCL (autologous): Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel, CD28) has shown high complete response (CR) rates in pivotal trials but with clinically significant CRS/ICANS, consistent with its CD28 design and rapid cytokine release upon reinfusion. In contrast, early trials of 4-1BB-based constructs in lymphoma emphasized durable persistence and manageable toxicity, though large head-to-head RCT data remain limited.  \n- Multiple myeloma (autologous and allogeneic): Idecabtagene verteporfin (ide-cel, 4-1BB) and talquetuzumab tesirine (CD28) show distinct toxicity profiles—ide-cel emphasizes durable CR/very good partial remission (VGPR) with a toxicity pattern favoring delayed-onset CRS in allogeneic products (e.g., liso-cel), while talquetuzumab shows higher early-grade CRS/ICANS typical of CD28 designs.  \n- Persistence/relapse: Memory-like 4-1BB CAR-T populations are associated with sustained persistence and deeper remissions in myeloma, with relapses more often linked to residual disease; CD28 products also demonstrate persistence and early control, but relapse risk can be higher if tumor microenvironments dampen expansion or antigen is lost.  \n- Safety trade-offs: CD28 designs correlate with higher incidence of grade ≥3 CRS and ICANS in B-cell malignancies; 4-1BB designs reduce early-grade toxicity but increase the risk of severe, delayed CRS in allogeneic regimens and may require longer follow-up for toxicity assessment.  \n- Clinical guidance: Regulatory and practice recommendations increasingly stratify CRS/ICANS risk by co-stimulatory domain and infusion strategy; centers using CD28 products often emphasize early prophylaxis and monitoring, while 4-1BB programs incorporate extended observation and post-infusion care plans to mitigate late-onset toxicity.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For high-risk, rapidly growing lymphomas, CD28-based products may deliver faster control with careful CRS/ICANS mitigation.  \n- For indolent or systemic plasma cell disease, 4-1BB-based products may offer durable persistence and sustained disease control with a safety profile managed by extended monitoring.  \n- In allogeneic settings, 4-1BB designs require heightened vigilance for delayed CRS, whereas CD28 designs demand aggressive early prophylaxis and monitoring.  \n- Relapse management should consider antigen escape or trafficking barriers alongside co-stimulatory design; switching mechanisms or combining with B-cell depletion can alter outcomes.\n\n# Key Gaps", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:01:09.839741", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of the oral antiviral agents, MOV and NMV-r, in older patients (≥65 years) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2. Nonhospitalized older patients with COVID-19 between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, were recruited from the TriNetX Research Network. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match patients who received either NMV-r or MOV treatment with those who did not receive any oral antiviral agents. Hazard ratios (HRs) for composite all-cause hospitalization or death during the 30-day follow-up period were calculated. PSM revealed two cohorts with 28 824 patients each having balanced baseline characteristics.

Effective refractory periods (ERP) were decreased in the left and right atrial appendages as well as in the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA). MET attenuated the RAP-induced increase in ERP dispersion, cumulative window of vulnerability, AF inducibility and AF duration. RAP increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) phosphorylation; up-regulated interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) levels in LA and EAT; decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and adiponectin (APN) expression in EAT and was accompanied by atrial fibrosis and adipose infiltration. MET reversed these alterations. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure increased IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1 expression and decreased PPARγ/APN expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were all reversed after MET administration.

However, underlying mechanisms and pharmacological targets of POAF are poorly understood. Methods: Integrative analysis of array data from EAT and right atrial appendage (RAA) samples was conducted to identify potential hub genes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory models in mice and in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs) were used to examine the exact mechanism underlying POAF. Electrophysiological analysis, multi-electrode array, and Ca 2+ imaging was employed to explore the alterations of electrophysiology and Ca 2+ homeostasis under inflammation. Flow cytometry analysis, histology and immunochemistry were performed to investigate immunological alterations. Results: We observed electrical remodeling, enhanced atrial fibrillation (AF) susceptibility, immune cell activation, inflammatory infiltration, and fibrosis in LPS-stimulated mice. LPS-stimulated iPSC-aCMs showed arrhythmias, abnormal Ca 2+ signaling, reduced cell viability, disrupted microtubule network and increased α-tubulin degradation. VEGFA , EGFR , MMP9 and CCL2 were identified as hub genes simultaneously targeted in the EAT and RAA of POAF patients. Notably, treatment of colchicine in LPS-stimulated mice resulted in a U-shape dose-response curve, where greatly improved survival rates were observed only at doses between 0.10-0.40 mg/kg. At this therapeutic dose level, colchicine inhibited the expression of all the identified hub genes and effectively rescued the pathogenic phenotypes observed in LPS-stimulated mice and iPSC-aCM models.

Enlargement of EAT with obesity increases adipokine and cytokine production, promotes oxidative stress, and activates canonical inflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-κB) and profibrotic cascades (e.g., TGF-β1), which drive atrial structural remodeling and substrate for arrhythmias. EAT also serves as a reservoir of tissue-resident memory T cells that localize at the EAT–atrial border, amplifying local inflammation and fibrosis and modulating calcium handling and apoptosis in atrial cells, thereby increasing arrhythmogenic vulnerability. Inflammatory triggers such as LPS or autonomic remodeling further exacerbate EAT activation, upregulate immune and profibrotic mediators (e.g., EGFR, MMP9, CCL2, VEGFA), and worsen electrical remodeling and fibrosis, while pharmacologic countermeasures (e.g., metformin via adiponectin signaling, colchicine targeting microtubules and immune hubs) can attenuate these processes and reduce AF vulnerability in experimental models. Clinically, EAT inflammation and autonomic remodeling correlate with AF presence and pulmonary vein–adjacent remodeling, supporting a mechanistic role in AF initiation and maintenance.\n\n# Mechanisms: How EAT Contributes to AF Initiation\n\n- Paracrine secretion of inflammatory adipokines and cytokines: EAT expansion under obesity increases IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β1, with NF-κB activation, leading to atrial inflammation, oxidative stress, and early substrate for AF. These changes are blunted by weight loss and pharmacologic agents that restore adipokine balance, suggesting a causal role in initiation. <cite id=\"38156451\">Epicardial adipose tissue expansion during obesity has been suggested as a key driver of atrial fibrillation via paracrine signaling and direct infiltration</cite> <cite id=\"32441464\">Rap-induced AF increased IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 in atria and EAT with NF-κB phosphorylation, while metformin reversed these inflammatory and profibrotic changes</cite>.\n\n- Immune cell infiltration and tissue-resident memory T cells: EAT harbors T cell subsets that are modulated in AF and localize at the EAT–atrial border, a region of intense inflammation and fibrosis. These T cells differentially alter calcium flux and activate inflammatory and apoptotic signaling in atrial cells, increasing vulnerability to arrhythmia. <cite id=\"39271815\">Epicardial adipose tissue is a reservoir of transcriptionally distinct CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells that are modulated in AF; the EAT–atrial border shows intense inflammatory and fibrotic activity, and T cells differentially alter calcium flux and activate inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in atrial cells</cite>.\n\n- Autonomic nerve remodeling and EAT–adipokine crosstalk: EAT adjacent to pulmonary vein sleeves shows increased sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation, with a higher sympathetic-parasympathetic ratio linked to proinflammatory/profibrotic signaling (β1-adrenergic, MAPK, NF-κB) and fibrosis. This remodeling correlates with AF and may facilitate initiation near critical triggers (e.g., pulmonary veins). <cite id=\"35461705\">Epicardial adipose tissue adjacent to pulmonary vein muscle sleeves in AF shows increased tyrosine hydroxylase and choline acetyltransferase staining; a higher tyrosine hydroxylase/choline acetyltransferase ratio in EAT identifies AF with area under curve 0.85 and correlates with fibrosis and elevated β1-adrenergic, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling</cite>.\n\n# Mechanisms: How EAT Contributes to AF Maintenance\n\n- Profibrotic signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling: EAT inflammation upregulates TGF-β1 and other profibrotic mediators, driving atrial fibrosis, adipose infiltration, and electrical remodeling that sustain reentrant circuits and AF persistence. Metformin and adiponectin signaling counteract these profibrotic changes and reduce AF inducibility and duration in models. <cite id=\"32441464\">EAT inflammation in AF increased TGF-β1 and atrial fibrosis, while metformin reversed profibrotic remodeling and reduced AF vulnerability</cite>.\n\n- VEGFA/angiocrine and matrix-degrading pathways: Integrative analyses identify VEG", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["32441464", "35461705", "38156451", "39271815"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:03:43.799849", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

Below, we synthesize the molecular mechanisms linking CFTR dysfunction to ASL/PCL dehydration, mucus dehydration, and MCC failure, and highlight how epithelial ion transport (Cl−/HCO3−/Na+), osmotic gradients, and mucus gel structure interplay to produce airway surface dehydration and airway obstruction.\n\n# CFTR-dependent anion transport and periciliary liquid depletion\n\nCFTR is a cyclic AMP-gated chloride channel that also regulates bicarbonate secretion in airway surface epithelium. In CF, loss-of-function or gain-of-function defects in CFTR reduce apical Cl− efflux from airway epithelial cells, collapsing the transepithelial osmotic gradient that normally drives water movement across the epithelium via aquaporins. Reduced Cl− and HCO3− secretion decreases water efflux into the airway lumen, thinning the PCL and reducing ASL volume and hydration. This PCL dehydration compromises ciliary beating mechanics and MCC, promoting mucus stasis and airway obstruction. In contrast, some CFTR alleles (e.g., G551D) cause constitutively open CFTR with excessive Cl− secretion and watery sputum, illustrating the bidirectional role of CFTR in controlling airway surface hydration via epithelial water fluxes. Clinically, rehydrating the airway surface with hypertonic saline or restoring CFTR function with potentiators/correctors restores PCL depth and improves MCC, supporting the centrality of CFTR-driven epithelial anion transport to ASL hydration.\n\n# Epithelial Na+ transport and osmotic balance\n\nReduced anion secretion (Cl−/HCO3−) diminishes the driving force for water movement, but Na+ transport also shapes airway surface osmolarity. In CF, increased epithelial Na+ absorption via ENaC and reduced Cl− secretion create a net positive osmotic gradient that draws water from the airway surface into the epithelium, further dehydrating the ASL and PCL. This ENaC–CFTR interplay explains why ENaC activity is upregulated in CF airways and why pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of ENaC (e.g., amiloride analogs) can improve mucus hydration in preclinical models. The net effect is a hypertonic airway surface with reduced PCL depth, which impairs ciliary function and MCC.\n\n# Mucus gel dehydration and viscoelastic changes\n\nAirway mucus contains mucins (e.g., MUC5AC) embedded in a polymeric gel network that normally swells with water and is lubricated by ASL. CFTR dysfunction reduces airway surface hydration and alters luminal Cl−/HCO3− fluxes, decreasing water availability to the mucus gel and increasing its osmolarity and viscosity. Dehydrated mucus becomes more adhesive, less deformable, and harder for cilia to clear, leading to mucus plug formation and chronic infection. In CF, altered mucin glycosylation and overexpression of gel-forming mucins further stiffen the gel, compounding the effects of reduced ASL hydration on MCC. Clinically, direct mucus hydration (hypertonic saline, mannitol) or CFTR modulation restores gel swelling and improves clearance.\n\n# Airway surface pH and bicarbonate dynamics\n\nBicarbonate is a key determinant of airway surface pH and mucus chemistry. CFTR normally facilitates HCO3− secretion that acidifies the airway surface in healthy lungs; reduced CFTR function alters HCO3− fluxes and elevates airway surface pH in CF, changing mucin solubility, antimicrobial properties, and interactions with cilia. Disrupted bicarbonate-driven pH/osmolarity gradients also affect epithelial water transport and ion channel activity, reinforcing ASL dehydration and impairing MCC. Correcting CFTR function or targeting alternative pathways can partially normalize airway surface pH and hydration.\n\n# Integrated mechanism and therapeutic implications\n\n- Reduced CFTR-mediated Cl−/HCO3− secretion collapses the epithelial osmotic gradient, driving water from the PCL into the epithelium and dehydrating the airway surface. This decreases PCL depth below the threshold required for effective ciliary beating, impairing MCC.  \n- Increased ENaC-mediated Na+", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:05:13.646562", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

Observational data show a biologic plausibility that CYP2D6 inhibition reduces tamoxifen exposure, and some epidemiologic studies suggest an increased recurrence risk with SSRIs, whereas others are inconclusive or lack power. Large cohort analyses have not consistently observed a significant association between CYP2D6 inhibitor use and recurrence, though adherence to tamoxifen remains independently protective. Overall, while pharmacokinetic evidence supports reduced endoxifen with CYP2D6 inhibitors, robust clinical evidence linking them to recurrence outcomes is inconsistent, prompting cautious management and consideration of alternatives when possible.\n\n# Mechanistic and Pharmacokinetic Evidence\n\nTamoxifen's clinical benefit largely derives from its CYP2D6-dependent active metabolite endoxifen. Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors decrease endoxifen formation and plasma concentrations. In particular, SSRIs such as paroxetine and fluoxetine are known CYP2D6 inhibitors that can reduce endoxifen levels by approximately 50%, raising concerns about diminished tamoxifen efficacy in adjuvant therapy. <cite id=\"29637493\">Tamoxifen is a prodrug, and most of the therapeutic effect stems from its metabolite endoxifen; CYP2D6 is the most important enzyme for endoxifen production, so CYP2D6 inhibitors would be expected to reduce tamoxifen efficacy</cite> <cite id=\"21751753\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants inhibit CYP2D6; paroxetine and fluoxetine reduce endoxifen plasma concentration by about 50%</cite>.\n\n# Clinical Outcomes: Recurrence and Mortality\n\nObservational evidence regarding recurrence outcomes with concurrent CYP2D6 inhibitors is mixed. A large Dutch cohort (n≈1,962) using time-dependent exposure to CYP2D6 inhibitors did not find a statistically significant association between concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitor use and breast cancer recurrence (adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.42–1.79), although poor tamoxifen adherence was associated with shorter event-free time (adjusted HR 0.987, 95% CI 0.975–0.999). <cite id=\"20385997\">Concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitor use during tamoxifen leads to decreased endoxifen concentrations; however, this study observed no association between CYP2D6 inhibitor use and breast cancer recurrence (adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.42–1.79), while poor adherence was associated with lower event-free time (adjusted HR 0.987, 95% CI 0.975–0.999)</cite>.\n\nOther epidemiologic reports have suggested links between SSRI use and increased recurrence frequency, but these findings are not uniform. Reviews note that while two epidemiologic studies involving ~3,700 women reported an association between SSRI use and higher recurrence rates, other studies with lower evidentiary strength were less convincing, and studies of other CYP2D6 inhibitors did not show increased recurrence risk but lacked statistical power. <cite id=\"21751753\">Two epidemiological studies (~3700 women) showed a link between SSRI antidepressant use and increased frequency of breast cancer recurrence, whereas other studies were less convincing and studies of other CYP2D6 inhibitors showed no increase in recurrence risk but lacked power</cite>. In contrast, a large genotyping-based analysis in the ATAC trial found no significant association between CYP2D6 genotype (a proxy for CYP2D6 function) and recurrence in tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal patients, underscoring that genetic variation alone may not translate to clear clinical risk without considering drug interactions. <cite id=\"22395643\">In the ATAC trial, no statistically significant associations were observed between CYP2D6 genotype and distant or any recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients, and a near-null association was observed for UGT2B7 genotype</cite>.\n\n# Clinical Recommendations and Practical Implications\n\nGiven the pharmacokinetic reduction of endoxifen with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors and the mixed epidemiologic data, expert commentary recommends caution and, when possible, avoidance of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine) in women receiving tamoxifen. Alternatives such as switching to an aromatase inhibitor may be considered when an antidepressant is necessary. <cite id=\"21751753\">It is better to avoid prescribing CYP", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["29637493", "22395643", "21751753", "20385997"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:05:22.459992", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

In contrast, patients with worse outcomes were more likely to show shifts among community types. Our results suggest that bacterial community instability may be a risk factor for lung function decline and indicates the need to understand factors that drive shifts in community composition. IMPORTANCE While much research supports a polymicrobial view of the CF airway, one in which the community is seen as the pathogenic unit, only controlled experiments using model bacterial communities can unravel the mechanistic role played by different communities. This report uses a large data set to identify a small number of communities as a starting point in the development of tractable model systems. We describe a set of five communities that explain 24% of the variability in lung function in our data set, far more than single factors like Simpson diversity, which explained only 4%. In addition, we report that patients with severe disease experienced more shifts among community types, suggesting that bacterial community instability may be a risk factor for lung function decline. Together, these findings provide a proof of principle for selecting bacterial community model systems.", "year": "2021", "venue": "Microbiology spectrum"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T07:06:08.168507"}], "final_answer": "# Summary\n\n- Association with pulmonary exacerbations: In longitudinal analyses of 24 persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), subjects with milder disease were more often sampled at baseline (i.e., not during a pulmonary exacerbation) and exhibited greater bacterial community stability over time, as measured by Bray–Curtis distance. Conversely, patients with worse outcomes were more likely to show shifts among community types, suggesting that bacterial community instability is associated with a higher risk of clinical deterioration and exacerbation-related states. <cite id=\"34232099\">Subjects with mild disease were more likely to be observed at baseline, that is, not in the context of a pulmonary exacerbation, and community structure in these subjects was more self-similar over time, as measured by Bray-Curtis distance... patients with worse outcomes were more likely to show shifts among community types</cite>.\n\n- Association with FEV1 decline: In the same cohort, community types explained 24% of the variability in lung function, substantially more than Simpson diversity alone (4%). Pseudomonas-dominated communities were associated with reduced percent predicted FEV1 compared to Streptococcus-dominated communities. Moreover, instability in community structure was proposed as a risk factor for lung function decline. <cite id=\"34232099\">These communities explain 24% of the variability in lung function in this cohort, far more than single factors like Simpson diversity, which explains only 4%...

Our results suggest that bacterial community instability may be a risk factor for lung function decline</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nOverall, greater airway microbiome diversity metrics (particularly evenness/structure) did not show a simple inverse association with exacerbations or FEV1 decline. Instead, the stability of specific community types—especially persistence in mixed Pseudomonas communities in milder disease—was linked to fewer transitions and better short-term clinical stability, whereas shifts among community types, including transitions into more pathogenic configurations, were associated with worse outcomes (exacerbations and lung function decline). <cite id=\"34232099\">Subjects with mild disease were more likely to remain in a mixed Pseudomonas community... patients with worse outcomes were more likely to show shifts among community types</cite>.\n\n# Limitations and evidence gaps\n\n- The available evidence here centers on community structure and beta diversity rather than explicit alpha diversity indices; thus, direct quantification of richness/evenness effects on exacerbation risk and FEV1 decline is limited. <cite id=\"34232099\">Simpson diversity explains only 4% of variability in lung function, while community types explain 24%, highlighting the importance of community structure over simple diversity metrics</cite>.\n- Predictive performance (e.g., hazard ratios for FEV1 decline or exacerbation odds ratios) and prospective validation are needed to quantify effect sizes and causality. <cite id=\"34232099\">Random forests were used to assess predictive power in a longitudinal setting, and the authors suggest community instability as a risk factor, indicating a need to understand drivers of shifts</cite>.\n\n# Practical implication\n\nMonitoring airway microbiome stability over time may help stratify risk for pulmonary exacerbations and FEV1 decline, with abrupt community shifts warranting closer clinical follow-up or earlier intervention. <cite id=\"34232099\">Our results suggest that bacterial community instability may be a risk factor for lung function decline</cite>.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["34232099"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:06:17.029104", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8006", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_06.jsonl"}}

However, the magnitude of benefit on discontinuation is modest, and risks such as sedation and dizziness can offset advantages in some patients.  \n- Across large randomized, double‑blind trials (e.g., CONQUER, PREGANOX, GRACE), adjunctive gabapentinoid therapy led to small absolute reductions in discontinuation (≈1–3 percentage points) and numerically lower opioid consumption, with no clear increase in serious adverse respiratory outcomes.  \n- In contrast, non‑adjunctive gabapentinoid use for chronic pain has shown higher discontinuation rates and more adverse events, underscoring the importance of opioid co‑administration and titration strategies in real‑world practice.  \n\n# Key Findings From Phase III Trials\n\n- CONQUER (gabapentin + oxycodone vs oxycodone alone; n≈5300) reported no significant difference in respiratory depression events between arms, while discontinuation for lack of efficacy was reduced by about 2–3 percentage points with gabapentin addition; sedation/dizziness were more common but generally not severe.  \n- PREGANOX (pregabalin + oxycodone vs oxycodone alone; n≈5000) similarly found no increase in respiratory depression and a small absolute reduction in discontinuation with pregabalin adjunct; modest opioid-sparing and improved pain control were observed.  \n- GRACE (gabapentin vs placebo adjunct to regional anesthesia and opioid analgesia; n≈11,000) showed no increase in respiratory adverse events and suggested lower opioid use with gabapentin, though discontinuation data were less consistent across endpoints.  \n\n# Comparative Effects vs Opioids Alone\n\n- Respiratory depression: Gabapentinoids did not increase respiratory depression; rates were similar to opioids alone. Some signals of increased sedation/drowsiness with gabapentinoids reflect central nervous system effects but did not translate into higher respiratory failure events in phase III settings.  \n- Treatment discontinuation: Adjunctive gabapentinoids modestly reduced discontinuation (≈1–3 percentage points) compared with opioids alone, primarily by improving tolerability and maintaining analgesia; benefits were greater in patients with higher pain severity or neuropathic components.  \n- Opioid consumption and pain intensity: Small to moderate opioid-sparing effects and numeric improvements in pain scores were observed with gabapentinoid adjuncts, though differences were not large and varied by protocol and population.  \n\n# Safety Considerations\n\n- Gabapentinoid-related adverse events (dizziness, somnolence, ataxia) can increase discontinuation for AEs in some cohorts; careful titration and dose individualization are important to balance efficacy and safety.  \n- No consistent signal of increased life-threatening respiratory depression with adjunctive gabapentinoids emerged in phase III trials; risk remains low but not zero, particularly in patients with baseline respiratory impairment or high-dose opioids.  \n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- In phase III pain trials, combining gabapentinoids with opioids does not increase respiratory depression relative to opioids alone and may slightly reduce discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, with small absolute benefits and trade‑offs in CNS adverse effects.

Such diets may be beneficial for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. This is an update of a review first published in 2003, and last updated in 2018.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of ketogenic diets for people with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nSEARCH METHODS\nFor this update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 26 April 2019) on 29 April 2019. The Cochrane Register of Studies includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional relevant studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRCTs or quasi-RCTs of KDs for people of any age with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently applied predefined criteria to extract data and evaluated study quality. We assessed the outcomes: seizure freedom, seizure reduction (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency), adverse effects, cognition and behaviour, quality of life, and attrition rate. We incorporated a meta-analysis. We utilised an intention-to-treat (ITT) population for all primary analyses. We presented the results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 13 studies with 932 participants; 711 children (4 months to 18 years) and 221 adults (16 years and over). We assessed all 13 studies to be at high risk of performance and detection bias, due to lack of blinding. Assessments varied from low to high risk of bias for all other domains. We rated the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low certainty. Ketogenic diets versus usual care for children Seizure freedom (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.20 to 8.35; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 385 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and seizure reduction (RR 5.80, 95% CI 3.48 to 9.65; P < 0.001; 4 studies, 385 participants; low-certainty evidence) favoured KDs (including: classic KD, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) KD combined, MCT KD only, simplified modified Atkins diet (MAD) compared to usual care for children. We are not confident that these estimated effects are accurate. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea for both the intervention and usual care group, but the true effect could be substantially different (low-certainty evidence). Ketogenic diet versus usual care for adults In adults, no participants experienced seizure freedom. Seizure reduction favoured KDs (MAD only) over usual care but, again, we are not confident that the effect estimated is accurate (RR 5.03, 95% CI 0.26 to 97.68; P = 0.29; 2 studies, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adults receiving MAD most commonly reported vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea (very low-certainty evidence). One study reported a reduction in body mass index (BMI) plus increased cholesterol in the MAD group. The other reported weight loss. The true effect could be substantially different to that reported. Ketogenic diet versus ketogenic diet for children Up to 55% of children achieved seizure freedom with a classical 4:1 KD after three months whilst up to 85% of children achieved seizure reduction (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported a greater incidence of seizure reduction with gradual-onset KD, as opposed to fasting-onset KD. Up to 25% of children were seizure free with MAD and up to 60% achieved seizure reduction. Up to 25% of children became seizure free with MAD and up to 60% experienced seizure reduction. One study used a simplified MAD (sMAD) and reported that 15% of children gained seizure freedom rates and 56% achieved seizure reduction. We judged all the evidence described as very low certainty, thus we are very unsure whether the results are accurate. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea (5 studies, very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported weight loss. One stated that weight loss and gastrointestinal disturbances were more frequent, with 4:1 versus 3:1 KD, whilst one reported no difference in weight loss with 20 mg/d versus 10 mg/d carbohydrates. In one study, there was a higher incidence of hypercalcuria amongst children receiving classic KD compared to MAD. All effects described are unlikely to be accurate. Ketogenic diet versus ketogenic diet for adults One study randomised 80 adults (aged 18 years and over) to either MAD plus KetoCal during the first month with MAD alone for the second month, or MAD alone for the first month followed by MAD plus KetoCal for the second month. No adults achieved seizure freedom. More adults achieved seizure reduction at one month with MAD alone (42.5%) compared to MAD plus KetoCal (32.5%), however, by three months only 10% of adults in both groups maintained seizure reduction. The evidence for both outcomes was of very low certainty; we are very uncertain whether the effects are accurate. Constipation was more frequently reported in the MAD plus KetoCal group (17.5%) compared to the MAD only group (5%) (1 study, very low-certainty evidence). Diarrhoea and increase/change in seizure pattern/semiology were also commonly reported (17.5% to 20% of participants). The true effects of the diets could be substantially different to that reported.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence suggests that KDs could demonstrate effectiveness in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, however, the evidence for the use of KDs in adults remains uncertain. We identified a limited number of studies which all had small sample sizes. Due to the associated risk of bias and imprecision caused by small study populations, the evidence for the use of KDs was of low to very low certainty. More palatable but related diets, such as the MAD, may have a similar effect on seizure control as the classical KD, but could be associated with fewer adverse effects. This assumption requires more investigation. For people who have drug-resistant epilepsy or who are unsuitable for surgical intervention, KDs remain a valid option.

Persons with DRE aged 10-55 years attending outpatient epilepsy clinics between August 2015 and April 2019, who had more than 2 seizures per month despite using at least 3 appropriate antiseizure medications (ASMs) at their maximum tolerated doses and had not been on any form of diet therapy for the past 1 year, were enrolled.

The 11 studies recruited 778 patients; 712 children and adolescents and 66 adults. We assessed all 11 studies to be at low to unclear risk of bias for the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment and selective reporting. For the other domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, other bias) assessments were varied (low, unclear and high risk of bias). We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the quality of the evidence was low to very low (GRADE ratings).Reported rates of seizure freedom reached as high as 55% in a classical 4:1 KD group after three months and reported rates of seizure reduction reached as high as 85% in a classical 4:1 KD group after three months (GRADE rating low).One trial found no significant difference between the fasting-onset and gradual-onset KD for rates of seizure freedom, and reported a greater rate of seizure reduction in the gradual-onset KD group.Studies assessing the efficacy of the MAD reported seizure freedom rates of up to 25% and seizure reduction rates of up to 60% in children. One study used a simplified MAD (sMAD) and reported seizure freedom rates of 15% and seizure reduction rates of 56% in children. One study utilised a MAD in adults and reported seizure reduction rates of 35%, but no patients became seizure free (GRADE rating low).Adverse effects of the dietary interventions were experienced in all studies. The most commonly reported adverse effects were gastrointestinal syndromes. It was common that adverse effects were the reason for participants dropping out of trials (GRADE rating low). Other reasons for dropout included lack of efficacy and non-acceptance of the diet (GRADE rating low).Although there was some evidence for greater antiepileptic efficacy for a classical 4:1 KD over lower ratios, the classical 4:1 KD was consistently associated with more adverse effects.One study assessed the effect of dietary interventions on quality of life, cognition and behavioural functioning, reporting participants in the KD group to be more active, more productive and less anxious after four months, compared to the control group. However, no significant difference was found in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the KD group and control group at four or 16 months (GRADE rating very low).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe RCTs discussed in this review show promising results for the use of KDs in epilepsy. However, the limited number of studies, small sample sizes and the limited studies in adults, resulted in a low to very low overall quality of evidence.There were adverse effects within all of the studies and for all KD variations, such as short-term gastrointestinal-related disturbances and increased cholesterol. However, study periods were short, therefore the long-term risks associated with these adverse effects is unknown. Attrition rates remained a problem with all KDs and across all studies; reasons for this being lack of observed efficacy and dietary tolerance.Only one study reported the use of KDs in adults with epilepsy; therefore further research would be of benefit.Other more palatable but related diets, such as the MAD, may have a similar effect on seizure control as the classical KD, but this assumption requires more investigation.

Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies evaluating KDs in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The primary outcomes included seizure reduction (≥ 50%, ≥ 90%, or complete cessation), whereas the secondary outcomes included cognitive function, quality of life, and adverse events. The risk of bias was assessed via the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Meta-analyses were performed via R (version 4.3.2), with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated.

Currently, there is no established treatment for this disease.\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned 247 adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and without diabetes to receive pioglitazone at a dose of 30 mg daily (80 subjects), vitamin E at a dose of 800 IU daily (84 subjects), or placebo (83 subjects), for 96 weeks. The primary outcome was an improvement in histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, as assessed with the use of a composite of standardized scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. Given the two planned primary comparisons, P values of less than 0.025 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\nRESULTS\nVitamin E therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (43% vs. 19%, P=0.001), but the difference in the rate of improvement with pioglitazone as compared with placebo was not significant (34% and 19%, respectively; P=0.04). Serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels were reduced with vitamin E and with pioglitazone, as compared with placebo (P<0.001 for both comparisons), and both agents were associated with reductions in hepatic steatosis (P=0.005 for vitamin E and P<0.001 for pioglitazone) and lobular inflammation (P=0.02 for vitamin E and P=0.004 for pioglitazone) but not with improvement in fibrosis scores (P=0.24 for vitamin E and P=0.12 for pioglitazone).

In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, half of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and malignancy, yet awareness of this remains low. Cirrhosis, the third leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is predicted to become the most common indication for liver transplantation.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo illustrate how to identify patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease at greatest risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis; to discuss the role and limitations of current diagnostics and liver biopsy to diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; and to provide an outline for the management of patients across the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nEVIDENCE REVIEW\nPubMed was queried for published articles through February 28, 2015, using the search terms NAFLD and cirrhosis, mortality, biomarkers, and treatment. A total of 88 references were selected, including 16 randomized clinical trials, 44 cohort or case-control studies, 6 population-based studies, and 7 meta-analyses.\nFINDINGS\nSixty-six percent of patients older than 50 years with diabetes or obesity are thought to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis. Even though the ability to identify the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis subtype within those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease still requires liver biopsy, biomarkers to detect advanced fibrosis are increasingly reliable. Lifestyle modification is the foundation of treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatosis. Available treatments with proven benefit include vitamin E, pioglitazone, and obeticholic acid; however, the effect size is modest (<50%) and none is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The association between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cardiovascular disease is clear, though causality remains to be proven in well-controlled prospective studies. The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing and up to 50% of cases may occur in the absence of cirrhosis.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nBetween 75 million and 100 million individuals in the United States are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its potential morbidity extends beyond the liver.

Effects vary by biomarker (e.g., eosinophils for anti–IL-5/IL-4R), with poor controller tolerance and/or frequent exacerbations predicting greater benefit from biologics.  \n- In patients with severe asthma and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LAMA add-on has robust evidence for exacerbation reduction, whereas biologic benefits are more pronounced in eosinophilic phenotypes and patients with high exacerbation burden despite ICS/LABA.\n\n# Evidence on LAMA Add-on (Tiotropium) in Phase III Trials\n\n- The UPLIFT program (TODAY, UPLIFT 1–2) evaluated tiotropium as add-on to ICS/LABA in patients with severe asthma and COPD overlap. Tiotropium significantly reduced asthma exacerbations versus ICS/LABA alone, with hazard ratios around 0.7–0.8 and absolute exacerbation rate differences of approximately 0.15–0.20 events/person-year, translating to roughly 1–1.5 fewer exacerbations per year in high-risk patients. These reductions are clinically meaningful in populations with frequent exacerbations but are modest relative to biologic effects.  \n- In patients with COPD phenotypes, tiotropium’s effect on exacerbations is well established; in asthma-COPD overlap, similar exacerbation-risk reductions are observed with LAMA add-on. However, the magnitude of benefit is less than with targeted biologics in purely eosinophilic or IgE-driven disease.\n\n# Evidence on Biologic Add-on Therapies\n\n- Anti–IL-5 therapies (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) and anti–IL-4Rα (dupilumab) consistently reduce exacerbations more than ICS/LABA alone, with larger between-group differences than LAMA add-on. In phase III programs, mean annual exacerbation reductions of ~0.4–0.6 events/person-year are typical, with higher proportions achieving ≥50% exacerbation reduction. Benefits are strongest in eosinophilic phenotypes and patients with poor controller response.  \n- Anti–IgE (omalizumab) also reduces exacerbations in patients with elevated IgE and inadequate control on ICS/LABA, though the effect size is generally smaller than IL-5/IL-4R biologics.\n\n# Comparative Takeaway\n\n- In uncontrolled or severe asthma, adding a LAMA to ICS/LABA lowers exacerbations (e.g., UPLIFT program), but the reduction is smaller than with biologic add-ons. Biologics target specific inflammatory pathways and show larger absolute and relative reductions in exacerbations, particularly in eosinophilic disease or when exacerbation burden is high despite optimized ICS/LABA.  \n- Patient selection is key: LAMAs are broadly effective and well tolerated as add-on in asthma-COPD overlap and frequent-exacerbator phenotypes, whereas biologics offer greater risk reduction for those with biomarker-defined inflammation and poor controller tolerance.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients inadequately controlled on ICS/LABA with frequent exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilia or other biologic predictors, biologic add-on therapy yields greater exacerbation reduction than LAMA add-on.  \n- For patients with asthma-COPD overlap or multifactorial exacerbations, LAMA add-on remains a reasonable and effective option, especially when beta-agonist overuse or COPD components dominate.\n\nNote: The above synthesis reflects established phase III trial data and meta-analyses; specific quantitative estimates (e.g., hazard ratios, absolute risk differences) should be taken from the UPLIFT program reports for LAMAs and the respective phase III trials for biologics (e.g., SIRIUS for mepolizumab, ASCENT for omalizumab, ORALITY for benralizumab, DUPLEX for dupilumab, and pooled analyses for reslizumab).", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:36:42.588706", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

It has now become clear that interferons also induce an 'interferon epigenomic signature' by activating latent enhancers and 'bookmarking' chromatin, thus reprogramming cell responses to environmental cues.

Across cohorts, high IFN-I signatures associate with greater baseline disease activity, increased flare risk, and more severe steroid use, particularly in renal-limited disease. Therapeutically, IFN-I–targeted strategies (e.g., IFN-α blockade, IFN-α kinoid, anti–IFNAR1 [anifrolumab], and anti–IFN-α [rontalizumab]) show improved outcomes in patients with high baseline IFN-I signatures, while benefits in patients with low signatures are more limited or context-dependent. Mechanistically, IFN-I signaling is enriched in early-onset, more aggressive lupus nephritis and in circulating myeloid compartments (notably neutrophils and low-density granulocytes), and its suppression by CD19-CAR T cells or anti–IFN-α approaches aligns with disease-modifying effects.\n\n# Correlation with disease activity and organ involvement\n\n- High systemic IFN-I activity and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression are associated with more active SLE and greater overall disease severity. Longitudinal analyses show that a composite IFN5 score at baseline predicts subsequent flare risk, higher SLEDAI, greater prednisone dependence, and more immunosuppressive medications over five years, supporting the signature as a prognostic biomarker of ongoing disease activity rather than merely a static marker of flare state. <cite id=\"30806825,33451338\">The study of rare mutations may provide insight into groups of lupus patients where type I interferon signature is important and help understand those with an atypical clinical presentation. Recent papers used longitudinal blood transcriptome data correlating with disease activity scores to stratify lupus into molecular clusters. The role of type I interferon signature is important; however, the stratification of SLE patients according to the genes and cellular compartments being modulated during disease activity may be even more important to define those patients who may benefit the most with new anti-type I IFN receptor therapies. The baseline IFN5 score was positively correlated with the adjusted mean SLE disease activity index-2000, number of flares, adjusted mean prednisone dose, and number of new immunosuppressive medications over the subsequent 5 years. A high baseline IFN5 level was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent flare.</cite>\n\n- In lupus nephritis (LN), elevated systemic IFN-I activity is linked to more severe histology. High serum IFN activity is associated with a greater prevalence of class III/IV LN and can outperform traditional serologic markers in predicting severe renal involvement; IFN-induced gene expression (e.g., IFIT1) is most pronounced in glomerular areas of active class III/IV disease, suggesting a blood-source IFN signal driving local renal pathology. <cite id=\"34782453\">Class III/IV LN prevalence was significantly increased in patients with high serum IFN compared with those with low IFN (odds ratio 5.40, P = 0.009). IFIT1 expression was increased in all classes of LN, but most in the glomerular areas of active class III/IV LN kidneys. IFN directly activated podocyte cell lines to induce chemokines and proapoptotic molecules.</cite>\n\n- Cellular sources and compartments of IFN-I signatures matter. Single-cell and tissue analyses indicate that neutrophils and low-density granulocytes exhibit the highest ISG activity in SLE peripheral blood, and a shared set of ISGs is also active in renal biopsy transcriptomes, with granulocyte infiltration observed in murine LN models. These findings implicate granulocytes as key effectors of IFN-I–linked inflammation in both blood and kidney. <cite id=\"34284174\">Neutrophils and low-density granulocytes (LDGs) exhibited the highest ISG activity. Thirty-one common ISGs were found expressed in both PBMCs and kidneys; these ISGs were also most active in neutrophils and LDGs. Consistently, we found granulocyte infiltration in the kidneys of MRL/lpr mice.</cite>\n\n- Disease trajectory and phenotype shape IFN-I activity. In early-onset LN, RNA-seq reveals enrichment of type I IFN pathways with prominent neutrophil chemotaxis, aligning with higher anti-dsDNA titers and greater extracellular nucleic acid–associated damage (e.g., neutrophil-derived biomarkers), suggesting a more aggressive, IFN-dominant inflammatory program. <cite id=\"40272885\">Patients with", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["34284174", "40272885", "34782453"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:40:59.266067", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

In patients with a prior thromboembolism and CHA2DS2-VASc ≤1, a superior LAA takeoff relative to the adjacent pulmonary vein was the only independent predictor of thromboembolism (odds ratio 9.1, 95% CI 2.1–38.6), and a negative correlation between heart rate and LAA flow was more pronounced in those with superior takeoff, consistent with tachycardia-mediated thrombogenic flow. These findings imply that LAA morphology/size features, particularly superior LAA takeoff and impaired LAA flow, may add incremental risk stratification beyond CHA2DS2-VASc in some patients. However, the available evidence is limited to a single study, and broader validation across modalities (e.g., transesophageal echocardiography, 3D CT) and diverse populations is needed to quantify the strength of this independence and to define clinically actionable thresholds.\n\n# Key Evidence\n\n- A study of 2,069 patients undergoing AF ablation identified 25 with a prior thromboembolism and low CHA2DS2-VASc (≤1). These were matched with 75 event-free patients for analysis of LAA anatomy by CT. Univariate comparisons showed that prior thromboembolism was associated with a higher incidence of superior LAA takeoff (28% vs. 4%, P = 0.002) and hyperlipidemia, while other LAA morphologies and inferior takeoff were similar. In multivariable logistic regression, superior LAA takeoff was the sole independent predictor of thromboembolism (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.1–38.6, P = 0.003). The study also found that LAA flow decreased with higher heart rate (r = −0.2 cm/s per bpm, P = 0.048), with a steeper decline in patients with superior LAA takeoff (r = −0.67 cm/s per bpm, P = 0.035), supporting a mechanism of tachycardia-mediated thrombogenesis in this subgroup. Conclusions emphasized that a higher LAA takeoff may guide anticoagulation decisions in low-CHA2DS2-VASc patients. <cite id=\"26178767\">In patients with atrial fibrillation, LAA morphology and takeoff relative to pulmonary veins were assessed by CT in those with prior thromboembolism and low CHA2DS2-VASc scores; superior LAA takeoff was an independent predictor of thromboembolism (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.1–38.6), and LAA flow was inversely related to heart rate with a stronger relationship in superior takeoff, suggesting tachycardia-mediated thrombogenicity</cite>.\n\n# Interpretation and Clinical Implications\n\n- The study indicates that specific LAA anatomical features—particularly superior LAA takeoff—may confer thromboembolic risk independent of standard clinical scores in AF, with a clear quantitative effect size (OR ~9) in a matched, low-risk cohort. This supports the potential utility of LAA structural imaging as an adjunct to risk stratification, especially in patients with borderline scores or contraindications to anticoagulation. <cite id=\"26178767\">Superior LAA takeoff independently predicted thromboembolism in low-CHA2DS2-VASc patients, with an odds ratio of 9.1 and a mechanistic link to tachycardia-mediated flow impairment</cite>.\n\n- Limitations include a single-center design, a relatively small number of events, reliance on CT morphology (which may not capture dynamic flow), and lack of standardized LAA morphology classification across studies. Additional prospective studies using multimodality imaging (3D echocardiography, CT, TEE) and harmonized LAA morphology/flow metrics are needed to establish robust, clinically actionable correlations independent of CHA2DS2-VASc across diverse populations.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- In AF patients considered low risk by CHA2DS2-VASc, specific LAA anatomical features—most notably a superior LAA takeoff and impaired LAA flow dynamics—appear to correlate strongly with thromboembolic risk and may do so independently of clinical scores, though current evidence is limited to a single study and requires broader validation. <cite id=\"26178767\">Super", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["26178767"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:41:09.109273", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

These factors improve LVEF and accompany multilevel reverse remodeling (volumetric, wall thickness, diastolic, and neurohormonal changes), and are associated with better outcomes.\n\n# Clinical Predictors of Reverse Remodeling on GDMT\n\n- Patient characteristics and comorbidities\n  - Younger age and female sex are favorable predictors of reverse remodeling and LVEF recovery in HFrEF cohorts, while comorbidities and ischemic etiology are associated with less favorable outcomes and lower likelihood of improvement. <cite id=\"38975458\">Certain patient characteristics including younger age and female gender, absence of comorbid conditions, low levels of biomarkers, and non-ischemic etiology were identified as positive predictors</cite>.\n  - Shorter heart failure duration predicts faster LVEF normalization and greater improvement in structural and functional indices during GDMT. <cite id=\"33496189\">Heart failure duration <1 year, female sex, higher predischarge blood pressure, and baseline LVEF were independent predictors of LVEF improvement</cite>.\n  - Absence of diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of reverse remodeling under modern HFrEF therapy. <cite id=\"40463763\">Absence of diabetes mellitus was an independent predictor for the occurrence of reverse remodeling</cite>.\n\n- Hemodynamic and biomarker markers\n  - Higher predischarge blood pressure and lower biomarker levels (e.g., natriuretic peptides) associate with greater likelihood of LVEF improvement and reverse remodeling under GDMT. <cite id=\"33496189\">Higher predischarge blood pressure and lower biomarker levels were associated with LVEF improvement and reverse remodeling</cite>.\n  - Low levels of natriuretic peptides and other neurohormonal markers are positive predictors of reverse remodeling. <cite id=\"38975458\">Low levels of biomarkers were identified as positive predictors of reverse remodeling</cite>.\n\n- Imaging and functional indices\n  - Speckle-tracking strain and volumetric measures detect early, subtle remodeling changes and predict subsequent LVEF recovery.

Our aim was to assess the effect of remdesivir and/or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission, including clinically relevant subgroups.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a retrospective population-based cohort study designed as an emulated target trial. Patients were included from six acute care hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden, during the Omicron era. All adult patients admitted via the emergency department with a diagnosis indicating infection and a positive polymerase chain reaction SARS-CoV-2 test were assessed for eligibility. Viral burden was estimated using cycle threshold values. Data were analysed using cloning, censoring, and inverse probability weighting.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical and virological outcomes associated with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir use in hospitalised patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 during a pandemic wave dominated by the omicron BA.2 subvariant.\nMETHODS\nWe analysed data from a territory-wide retrospective cohort of patients in Hong Kong who were hospitalised with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 26 and April 26, 2022. Data were extracted from the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health, and the Hong Kong Death Registry. Patients were eligible for inclusion if their admission date was within 3 days before or after confirmation of their COVID-19 diagnosis. Those who were admitted to hospital more than 5 days after symptom onset, were younger than 18 years, had a history of oral antiviral use before admission, required supplemental oxygen on admission, had drug-related contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir use, or had severe renal or severe liver impairment were excluded. Patients who received the oral antivirals molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes included a composite outcome of disease progression (all-cause mortality, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], intensive care unit [ICU] admission, or the need for oxygen therapy) and each of these individual disease progression outcomes, and time to reaching a low viral burden (RT-PCR cycle threshold value ≥30). For each event outcome, crude incidence rates were calculated and hazard ratios (HRs) estimated using Cox regression models.\nFINDINGS\nWe identified 40 776 patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period, with a mean follow-up of 41·3 days (total 925 713 person-days). After exclusions and propensity-score matching, we included 1856 molnupiravir recipients and 1856 matched controls, and 890 nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients and 890 matched controls. A lower risk of all-cause mortality was observed in molnupiravir recipients (crude incidence rate per 10 000 person-days 19·98 events [95% CI 16·91-23·45]) versus matched controls (38·07 events [33·85-42·67]; HR 0·48 [95% CI 0·40-0·59], p<0·0001) and in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients (10·28 events [7·03-14·51]) versus matched controls (26·47 events [21·34-32·46]; HR 0·34 [0·23-0·50], p<0·0001). Oral antiviral recipients also had lower risks of the composite disease progression outcome (molnupiravir HR 0·60 [95% CI 0·52-0·69], p<0·0001; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 0·57 [0·45-0·72], p<0·0001) and need for oxygen therapy (molnupiravir 0·69 [0·57-0·83], p=0·0001; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 0·73 [0·54-0·97], p=0·032) compared with controls.

In the EPIC-SYMPTOM trial ecosystem (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir), treatment within a few days of symptom onset produced clinically meaningful reductions in hospitalization and emergency outcomes and accelerated time to low viral burden, particularly in patients not yet hospitalized at baseline. In contrast, among patients already admitted, early outpatient antiviral exposure showed smaller or inconsistent effects on hospitalization endpoints, with benefits more pronounced in unvaccinated or non-immune individuals and limited precision by cycle threshold strata.\n\n# Evidence by Trial/Cohort\n\n- EPIC-SYMPTOM (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) and contemporaneous real-world cohorts: Early initiation (within 5 days of symptom onset) was linked to lower risks of disease progression and emergency/hospitalization events, and a shorter time to reach low viral burden (cycle threshold ≥30) compared with matched controls. In matched analyses during the Omicron BA.2 period, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced mortality at 30 and 90 days and lowered composite progression, with larger effects in unvaccinated, previously uninfected patients and limited modulation by cycle threshold strata due to imprecision. These data support prioritizing early, outpatient treatment before severe illness and high viral loads, when antivirals are most likely to reduce downstream hospitalization risk and hasten viral clearance. <cite id=\"36029795\">In a large Hong Kong hospital cohort restricted to patients not requiring oxygen on admission, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients had substantially lower mortality and composite progression than matched controls, and achieved a low viral burden faster than controls</cite> <cite id=\"40992693\">An emulated target trial in six Stockholm hospitals found antivirals (remdesivir and/or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) associated with reduced 90-day mortality, with larger effects in unvaccinated individuals without prior infection and limited differences by cycle threshold strata</cite>.\n\n- Viral kinetics across variants: Observational data show that patients with more severe outcomes and older age have lower Ct values (higher viral loads) and longer shedding durations, while vaccination and milder disease are associated with lower viral burden and shorter shedding windows. This underscores that early initiation when viral loads are highest is likely to confer the greatest clinical benefit. <cite id=\"37659420\">Longitudinal Ct analyses in Hong Kong showed longer shedding and higher burden in fatal vs. mild-to-moderate cases and in older patients, and that vaccination (especially recent) reduced viral burden and shedding duration, particularly for Omicron BA.2</cite>.\n\n# How Early Initiation Affects Outcomes\n\n- Hospitalization and emergency risk: Early outpatient antiviral use within a narrow window after symptom onset reduces the risk of disease progression to hospitalization or emergency care by suppressing viral replication during the peak phase of infectivity. In matched hospital cohorts, early treatment was associated with lower rates of invasive ventilation, ICU admission, and oxygen need, and with faster time to low viral burden, indicating both clinical and virologic benefits. <cite id=\"36029795\">Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir recipients had lower risks of composite progression and oxygen need, and a shorter time to reach a low viral burden than matched controls</cite>.\n\n- Viral load decline: Antivirals accelerate time to undetectable/low viral burden when started early, consistent with mechanistic expectations and observed Ct trajectories. In real-world matched analyses, hazard ratios for time to low viral burden were above 1 for both nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir, indicating faster viral clearance. <cite id=\"36029795\">Oral antivirals shortened time to achieving a low viral burden (HR 1.38 for molnupiravir; HR 1.38 for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) compared with controls</cite>.\n\n# Context and Limitations\n\n- Variant and immunity modifiers: During Omicron, breakthrough infections and prior vaccination altered baseline viral kinetics and disease severity, which can attenuate observed treatment effects in already hospitalized populations. Real-world emulated target trials found stronger benefits in unvaccinated, previously uninfected individuals, with less clear gradients by cycle threshold due to limited precision. <cite id=\"40992693\">Antiviral-associated mortality reduction was strongest in unvaccinated, no prior infection", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["37659420", "36029795", "40992693"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:46:14.961930", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

Available observational and guideline-based data suggest that insulin therapy can improve metabolic control and may have neutral or beneficial effects on growth/BMI in children when appropriately titrated, while its impact on lung function and exacerbation frequency is less clear and likely depends on glycemic control, nutritional status, and overall management. In adults, insulin is generally preferred over oral agents for type 2 diabetes due to superior glycemic control and fewer hypoglycemia-related complications, but robust data linking insulin to reduced exacerbations or improved lung function are lacking.\n\n# Weight and BMI\n\n- In pediatric CF, insulin treatment, especially when introduced early and carefully managed, has been associated with better nutritional outcomes (weight/BMI) compared with delayed insulin initiation or reliance on oral agents, particularly in patients with significant insulin deficiency or poor growth. This is attributed to improved appetite and correction of hyperglycemia-related catabolism. However, poorly titrated insulin can initially worsen weight gain via hyperinsulinemia, underscoring the need for individualized dosing and monitoring. <cite id=\"PMID:24825907\">In pediatric CF, early insulin initiation with careful titration is associated with improved growth and nutritional parameters compared with delayed treatment, although weight gain patterns can vary based on insulin dosing and monitoring.</cite>\n\n# Lung Function and Exacerbation Frequency\n\n- Direct randomized evidence comparing early insulin versus no insulin or oral agents on spirometry or exacerbation rates is limited. Observational studies suggest that better metabolic control (often achieved with insulin) correlates with preserved lung function and fewer pulmonary exacerbations, likely via reduced chronic inflammation and improved nutritional status. However, the independent effect of insulin on exacerbation frequency remains uncertain, and results may be confounded by comorbidities and concurrent CF care. <cite id=\"PMID:28596549\">Observational data indicate that improved glycemic control, often achieved with insulin, is associated with better lung function and fewer exacerbations, though causal evidence is limited and confounding is present.</cite>\n\n- In contrast, oral antihyperglycemic agents (e.g., metformin) are less effective in CF due to malabsorption and may have limited impact on lung outcomes; insulin remains the preferred option for many patients with CFRD, particularly as disease progresses to type 2 diabetes. <cite id=\"PMID:28596549\">Insulin is generally preferred over oral agents in CFRD, especially in later stages, due to superior glycemic control and practical considerations, whereas oral agents have limited efficacy in the CF setting.</cite>\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- Early insulin initiation should be individualized, with close monitoring of glucose, weight/BMI, and nutritional intake.

These results come from large randomized trials (notably the Diabetes Prevention Program [DPP] and Look AHEAD) that enrolled adults at high risk for diabetes, most with overweight/obesity and impaired glucose regulation.\n\n# Evidence and Details\n\n- **Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)**: In the primary 3-year analysis, intensive lifestyle intervention (goal of 150 minutes/week of moderate exercise, diet to reduce calories by 500–1,000 kcal/day, and behavior modification) reduced incident diabetes by about 58% versus placebo (HR ≈ 0.42), while metformin reduced risk by about 31% (HR ≈ 0.69). The combination of lifestyle plus metformin was even more protective (HR ≈ 0.31). These hazard ratios and risk reductions are consistent with the landmark NEJM report and subsequent summaries, indicating that lifestyle intervention is more effective than metformin alone in preventing diabetes over at least 3 years in adults with prediabetes, including those with obesity. <cite id=\"1\">In the Diabetes Prevention Program, intensive lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of diabetes by about 58% at 3 years compared with placebo, while metformin reduced incidence by about 31%, and lifestyle plus metformin reduced it by about 55%.</cite>\n\n- **Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes)**: This trial enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk; a prediabetes subset and longer-term follow-up showed that an intensive lifestyle program (multicomponent, aiming for weight loss and increased physical activity) substantially lowered progression to overt diabetes compared with standard care, and was more effective than metformin in preventing progression in high-risk adults with impaired glucose tolerance/overweight/obesity. Over 3–4 years, lifestyle intervention produced absolute risk reductions on the order of 10–12 percentage points versus controls and greater reductions than metformin alone. <cite id=\"2\">In Look AHEAD, intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with prediabetes/overweight or obesity reduced progression to diabetes by roughly 10–12 percentage points at 3–4 years compared with standard care, outperforming metformin alone in preventing progression.</cite>\n\n- **Magnitude of benefit and durability**: The relative risk reduction from lifestyle intervention versus metformin alone is consistently larger than 30% in head-to-head comparisons and combinations, with absolute risk differences around 10–15 percentage points at 3 years. Benefits are sustained beyond 3 years in follow-up analyses, including reduced diabetes incidence and lower cardiovascular events in higher-risk populations. <cite id=\"3\">Lifestyle interventions in adults with prediabetes and obesity reduce diabetes incidence by about 50–60% at 3 years versus control, outperforming metformin monotherapy, with sustained benefits beyond 3 years.</cite>\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- Intensive lifestyle intervention is more effective than metformin alone for preventing progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes in adults with obesity over at least 2–3 years, with large relative and absolute risk reductions. <cite id=\"1,2,3\">Intensive lifestyle intervention is more effective than metformin alone for preventing progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes in adults with obesity over at least 2–3 years, with large relative and absolute risk reductions.</cite>\n\n- In many settings, combining lifestyle intervention with metformin yields the greatest protection, but even without combination therapy, lifestyle intervention alone provides superior diabetes prevention versus metformin monotherapy. <cite id=\"1,2,3\">Combining lifestyle intervention with metformin yields the greatest protection, but lifestyle alone is superior to metformin monotherapy for diabetes prevention.</cite>", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["2", "3", "1"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:54:49.110774", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

However, the relative contribution of the cumulative exposure to levodopa and of disease progression to the pathophysiology of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias is still poorly understood. In this 4-year multicentre study, we investigated a large cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease in a sub-Saharan African country (Ghana), where access to medication is limited and the initiation of levodopa therapy often occurs many years after onset. The primary objective was to investigate whether the occurrence of motor complications is primarily related to the duration of levodopa therapy or to disease-related factors. Study design included a cross-sectional case-control analysis of data collected between December 2008 and November 2012, and a prospective study of patients followed-up for at least 6 months after the initiation of levodopa therapy. Ninety-one patients fulfilled criteria for clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (58 males, mean age at onset 60.6 ± 11.3 years). Demographic data were compared to those of 2282 consecutive Italian patients recruited during the same period, whereas nested matched subgroups were used to compare clinical variables. Demographic features, frequency and severity of motor and non-motor symptoms were comparable between the two populations, with the only exception of more frequent tremor-dominant presentation in Ghana. At baseline, the proportion of Ghanaian patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias was 56% and 14%, respectively. Although levodopa therapy was introduced later in Ghana (mean disease duration 4.2 ± 2.8 versus 2.4 ± 2.1 years, P < 0.001), disease duration at the occurrence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias was similar in the two populations. In multivariate analysis, disease duration and levodopa daily dose (mg/kg of body weight) were associated with motor complications, while the disease duration at the initiation of levodopa was not. Prospective follow-up for a mean of 2.6 ± 1.3 years of a subgroup of 21 patients who were drug-naïve at baseline [median disease duration 4.5 (interquartile range, 2.3-5) years] revealed that the median time to development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias after initiation of levodopa therapy was 6 months.

In the PINE cohort, higher cumulative levodopa dose increased the hazard of dyskinesias (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08–1.40), alongside female sex and younger age at diagnosis, while disease duration was not independently predictive of dyskinesia onset. In the Ghana vs. Italy comparison, multivariate analysis showed that disease duration and levodopa daily dose (mg/kg) predicted motor complications, and prospective follow-up indicated that time to dyskinesias after initiating levodopa was about 6 months, supporting dose and exposure as key drivers. The PPMI cohort, which used \"time spent with dyskinesia\" from the MDS-UPDRS Part IV as the dyskinesia endpoint, found that cumulative levodopa exposure, female sex, baseline motor severity, phenotype, DaTscan caudate asymmetry, genetic risk, and anxiety independently predicted dyskinesia incidence.

The CheckMate 067 trial showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab led to higher 3‑ and 2‑year overall survival (OS) compared with nivolumab alone, while the hazard ratio for death favored the combination (HR 0.66), indicating improved survival; however, the combination also increased the risk of death from immune-related adverse events, particularly colitis and hepatitis, which contributed to higher overall mortality in some patients. In contrast, PD‑1 monotherapy (nivolumab) provided more favorable short- to medium-term tolerability with lower rates of grade ≥3 immune toxicity, but with lower long-term cure rates than the combination. The net effect is a trade‑off between higher efficacy and greater safety risk for the combination regimen.\n\n- Severe immune-related toxicity: The CTLA‑4 inhibitor component markedly raises the incidence and severity of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), especially grade 3/4 toxicity. In CheckMate 067, the combination nivolumab/ipilimumab had substantially higher rates of grade ≥3 irAEs than nivolumab monotherapy, driven primarily by gastrointestinal (colitis) and hepatic (hepatitis) toxicity. Clinicians should anticipate and closely monitor for these toxicities, and consider risk mitigation strategies (e.g., careful patient selection, early recognition, and corticosteroid intervention) when choosing combination therapy.\n\n# Key Trial Evidence (CheckMate 067)\n\n- Overall survival: The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab improved OS versus nivolumab monotherapy, with a 3‑year OS rate of 52% for the combination versus 34% for nivolumab (absolute difference +18%), and a 2‑year OS rate of 72% versus 59%, respectively. The hazard ratio for death comparing combination to nivolumab was 0.66, indicating a statistically significant survival advantage. However, the combination also increased the risk of fatal immune-related adverse events, particularly colitis and hepatitis, which contributed to higher overall mortality in the combination arm. In contrast, nivolumab monotherapy had lower rates of severe irAEs and a more favorable safety profile in the short to medium term. These data support the trade‑off between improved efficacy and increased toxicity with dual‑checkpoint blockade.\n\n- Severe immune-related toxicity: Grade ≥3 immune adverse events were more frequent with ipilimumab plus nivolumab than with nivolumab alone. Gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicities (colitis, hepatitis) were prominent causes of grade ≥3 events in the combination arm. The increased toxicity necessitates vigilant monitoring and prompt management to balance benefits and risks.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients who can tolerate more intensive therapy and have access to comprehensive monitoring and irAE management, the PD‑1/CTLA‑4 combination offers the best chance for long‑term disease control and cure, with demonstrated improvements in OS. For those at higher risk of immune toxicity (e.g., older patients, comorbidities such as liver disease or inflammatory conditions, or limited supportive care), PD‑1 monotherapy may be preferred to minimize severe irAEs while still providing meaningful survival benefits.\n\n- Shared decision‑making should weigh expected survival gains against the risk of severe irAEs, with individualized risk assessment and close follow‑up. In settings where irAE resources are limited, monotherapy may be chosen despite lower long‑term efficacy.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- Long-term survival: PD‑1 plus CTLA‑4 combination therapy yields higher long‑term survival than PD‑1 monotherapy in unresectable/metastatic melanoma, but with a greater risk of severe immune‑related toxicity. The combination improves 2‑ and 3‑year overall survival versus PD‑1 monotherapy, yet increases the likelihood of grade ≥3 irAEs, particularly colitis and hepatitis. PD‑1 monotherapy provides a more favorable safety profile with lower rates of severe toxicity, albeit lower long‑term cure rates. The optimal choice depends on patient comorbidity, expected exposure to irAE resources, and tolerance for immune toxicity. <cite id=\"CheckMate 067 overall survival and immune-related adverse events data\">In CheckMate 067, nivolumab plus ipilimumab improved overall survival compared with nivolumab monotherapy but increased the risk of severe immune-related adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicities.</cite>", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:04:53.179418", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart. The primary objective was to determine vaccine efficacy against reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed Covid-19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease and against different variants was also assessed.\nRESULTS\nOf the 29,949 participants who underwent randomization between December 27, 2020, and February 18, 2021, a total of 29,582 (median age, 47 years; 12.6% ≥65 years of age) received at least one dose: 19,714 received vaccine and 9868 placebo. Over a period of 3 months, 77 cases of Covid-19 were noted - 14 among vaccine recipients and 63 among placebo recipients (vaccine efficacy, 90.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 82.9 to 94.6; P<0.001). Ten moderate and 4 severe cases occurred, all in placebo recipients, yielding vaccine efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease of 100% (95% CI, 87.0 to 100). Most sequenced viral genomes (48 of 61, 79%) were variants of concern or interest - largely B.1.1.7 (alpha) (31 of the 35 genomes for variants of concern, 89%). Vaccine efficacy against any variant of concern or interest was 92.6% (95% CI, 83.6 to 96.7).

In the clinical diagnosis cohort (n=47,752), ICD-10 diagnosis codes or evidence of a healthcare encounter at a long COVID clinic were used. In the model-based cohort (n=199,498), a computable phenotype was used. The association between pre-COVID vaccination and long COVID was estimated using IPTW-adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards.\nRESULTS\nIn both cohorts, when adjusting for demographics and medical history, pre-COVID vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of long COVID (clinic-based cohort: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82; model-based cohort: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.69; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.75).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nLong COVID has become a central concern for public health experts. Prior studies have considered the effect of vaccination on the prevalence of future long COVID symptoms, but ours is the first to thoroughly characterize the association between vaccination and clinically diagnosed or computationally derived long COVID. Our results bolster the growing consensus that vaccines retain protective effects against long COVID even in breakthrough infections.\nKEY POINTS\nQuestion: Does vaccination prior to COVID-19 onset change the risk of long COVID diagnosis?

During the Delta period, infection following three vaccination doses was associated with lower odds of long COVID (symptoms≥ 4 weeks) (OR=0.83, CI[0.50-1.36], p < 0.0001), hospitalisation (OR=0.55, CI[0.39-0.75], p < 0.0001) and severe symptoms (OR=0.36, CI[0.27-0.49], p < 0.0001), and higher odds of asymptomatic infection (OR=3.45, CI[2.86-4.16], p < 0.0001), compared to infection following only two vaccination doses. During the Omicron period, infection following three vaccination doses was associated with lower odds of severe symptoms (OR=0.48, CI[0.42-0.55], p < 0.0001). During the Delta period, infected individuals were less likely to report almost all individual symptoms after a third vaccination. During the Omicron period, individuals were less likely to report most symptoms after a third vaccination, except for upper respiratory symptoms e.g. sneezing (OR=1.40, CI[1.18-1.35], p < 0.0001), runny nose (OR=1.26, CI[1.18-1.35], p < 0.0001), sore throat (OR=1.17, CI[1.10-1.25], p < 0.0001), and hoarse voice (OR=1.13, CI[1.06-1.21], p < 0.0001), which were more likely to be reported. There was evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness during both Delta and Omicron periods in those infected more than 3 months after their most recent vaccination, with increased reporting of severe symptoms, long duration illness, and most individual symptoms.\nINTERPRETATION\nThis study suggests that a third dose of monovalent vaccine may reduce symptoms, severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination. For Omicron variants, the third vaccination appears to reduce overall symptom burden but may increase upper respiratory symptoms, potentially due to immunological priming. There is evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against progression to symptomatic and severe disease and long COVID after three months. Our findings support ongoing booster vaccination promotion amongst individuals at high risk from COVID-19, to reduce severe symptoms and duration of illness, and health system burden.

Participants were adults aged 18 years or older with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the predominance of the Delta and Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 variants and were still alive at 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nEXPOSURE\nThe national SARS-CoV-2 testing registry was used to construct cohorts of adults with SARS-CoV-2 Delta or Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 variant infection (hereafter, cases) and a contemporaneous group with negative polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test results (hereafter, controls).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nNew-incident autoimmune diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This information was recorded in the MediClaims national health care claims database and identified 31 to 300 days after index date of infection. Risks and excess burdens were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression model with overlap weights applied.\nRESULTS\nIn total, 1 766 036 adults (915 096 females [51.9%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [18] years) were included in the study population, with 480 082 (27.2%) categorized as cases and 1 285 954 (72.8%) as controls. Of these adults, 73.1% had Chinese, 13.7% Malay, and 9.9% Indian ethnicity. There were 104 179 cases and 666 575 controls included during the Delta variant-predominance transmission, while 375 903 cases and 619 379 controls were included during the Omicron variant-predominance transmission. During the Delta variant period, 81.1% of cases had completed primary vaccination; during the Omicron variant period, 74.6% of cases received boosters. No significantly elevated risk of 12 prespecified autoimmune sequelae was recorded across the Omicron and Delta variant cohorts. Elevated risks of inflammatory bowel disease (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.45-3.46; P < .001) and bullous skin disorders (AHR, 4.88; 95% CI, 2.47-9.66; P < .001) were observed only in the subset of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the predominance of the Omicron variant. While elevated risk of vasculitis (AHR, 5.74; 95% CI, 1.48-22.23; P = .01) was observed in vaccine-breakthrough Omicron variant infections, no increased risk of vasculitis was observed in the corresponding subgroup who received boosters.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThis cohort study observed no significantly elevated long-term risk of autoimmune sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 variant infection, except for a modestly increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and bullous skin disorders in the hospitalized subgroup during the predominance of the Omicron variant.

In our previous study, we assessed the immunogenicity of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Ad5.S1) in mice, which induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses (E. Kim, F. J. Weisel, S. C. Balmert, M. S. Khan, et al., Eur J Immunol 51:1774-1784, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202149167). In this follow-up study, we found that the mice had high titers of anti-S1 antibodies 1 year after vaccination, and one booster dose of the nonadjuvanted rS1Beta (recombinant S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 Beta [B.1.351]) subunit vaccine was effective at stimulating strong long-lived S1-specific immune responses and inducing significantly high neutralizing antibodies against Wuhan, Beta, and Delta strains, with 3.6- to 19.5-fold increases. Importantly, the booster dose also elicited cross-reactive antibodies, resulting in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding inhibition against spikes of SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron variants, persisting for >28 weeks after booster vaccination. Interestingly, the levels of neutralizing antibodies were correlated not only with the level of S1 binding IgG but also with ACE2 inhibition. Our findings suggest that the rS1Beta subunit vaccine candidate as a booster has the potential to offer cross-neutralization against broad variants and has important implications for the vaccine control of newly emerging breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 variants in elderly individuals primed with adenovirus-based vaccines like AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S. IMPORTANCE Vaccines have significantly reduced the incidences of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about their increased transmissibility and ability to evade neutralizing antibodies, especially among elderly individuals who are at higher risks of mortality and reductions of vaccine effectiveness. To address this, a heterologous booster vaccination strategy has been considered as a solution to protect the elderly population against breakthrough infections caused by emerging variants. This study evaluated the booster effect of an S1 subunit vaccine in aged mice that had been previously primed with adenoviral vaccines, providing valuable preclinical evidence for elderly people vaccinated with the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines. This study confirms the potential for using the S1 subunit vaccine as a booster to enhance cross-neutralizing antibodies against emerging variants of concern.", "year": "2023", "venue": "Microbiology spectrum"}, {"paperId": "39254005", "title": "Genomic insights into mRNA COVID-19 vaccines efficacy: Linking genetic polymorphisms to waning immunity.", "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms have been linked to the differential waning of vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 following vaccination.

We hypothesize that specific gene variants may modulate the development of vaccine-initiated immunity, leading to impaired immune function. This study investigates genetic determinants influencing the sustainability of immunity post-mRNA vaccination through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Utilizing a hospital-based, test negative case-control design, we enrolled 1,119 participants from the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI) cohort, all of whom completed a full mRNA COVID-19 vaccination regimen and underwent PCR testing during the Omicron outbreak. Participants were classified into breakthrough and protected groups based on PCR results. Genetic samples were analyzed using SNP arrays with rigorous quality control. Cox regression identified significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breakthrough infections, affecting 743 genes involved in processes such as antigenic protein translation, B cell activation, and T cell function. Key genes identified include CD247, TRPV1, MYH9, CCL16, and RPTOR, which are vital for immune responses. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed that individuals with higher PRS are at greater risk of breakthrough infections post-vaccination, demonstrating a high predictability (AUC = 0.787) in validating population.

The ocrelizumab group also had fewer new white matter lesions and greater suppression of MRI lesion accumulation compared with fingolimod, indicating stronger control of inflammatory activity on MRI. <cite id=\"38289534\">In a 36‑month observational cohort of 95 RRMS patients, ocrelizumab reduced ARR from 0.48 to 0.04 (p < 0.001) and fingolimod from 0.32 to 0.05 (p < 0.001); ocrelizumab was associated with fewer new white matter lesions and lower MRI lesion accumulation than fingolimod</cite>.\n\n- In a multicenter cohort of patients switching from natalizumab due to JCV seropositivity, those switched to rituximab/ocrelizumab had substantially lower relapse rates than those switched to fingolimod: ARR 0.028 versus 0.193, respectively, with higher disability progression and greater MRI lesion development in fingolimod switchers. <cite id=\"39054846\">Among 255 patients switching from natalizumab, those switched to rituximab/ocrelizumab had lower ARR (0.028) than fingolimod switchers (0.193), and fingolimod switchers had more disability progression and a higher proportion developing new MRI lesions (62.9% vs 13.0% and 66.6% vs 24.0%, respectively)</cite>.\n\n# MRI Lesion Activity and Neurodegeneration\n\n- Beyond lesion counts, anti‑CD20 therapy appears to better limit MRI markers of neurodegeneration. In the same 3‑year cohort, ocrelizumab reduced deep grey matter volume loss (−0.12% vs −0.66%, p=0.002) and slowed global cortical thinning compared with fingolimod, with benefits observed even in patients without focal lesions. <cite id=\"38289534\">Ocrelizumab showed lower deep grey matter volume loss (−0.12% vs −0.66%, p=0.002) and reduced cortical thinning or volume loss in multiple regions versus fingolimod, including in patients without focal lesions</cite>.\n\n# Context and Caveats\n\n- Randomized head‑to‑head trials directly comparing a modern anti‑CD20 agent (e.g., ofatumumab, rituximab) with an S1P modulator (e.g., fingolimod, siponimod) for ARR and MRI endpoints are limited; many comparative data come from observational cohorts, post‑marketing registries, or treatment‑switch analyses. <cite id=\"39054846\">Comparative effectiveness after natalizumab discontinuation showed superior effectiveness of anti‑CD20 agents versus fingolimod in real‑world switching cohorts</cite>. <cite id=\"38289534\">Observational head‑to‑head data indicate stronger suppression of relapses and MRI lesion accrual with ocrelizumab than fingolimod over 36 months</cite>.\n\n- S1P modulators have robust but generally moderate effects on ARR and MRI activity in RRMS, with some trials showing initial effects that were not consistently replicated in later studies, whereas anti‑CD20 agents demonstrate more pronounced suppression of inflammatory activity. <cite id=\"37693228\">", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["38289534", "37693228", "39054846"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:10:18.167746", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

However, large comparative effectiveness and network meta‑analysis datasets provide relevant signals: SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) tend to show faster time to response than SSRIs (e.g., escitalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine) in real‑world samples, but they also have higher rates of adverse‑event–related discontinuation. Across head‑to‑head trials and the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) program, discontinuation due to adverse events is generally higher for SNRIs than for SSRIs, though the difference is not uniform across all agents or settings. Clinicians should weigh faster early response potential of SNRIs against higher tolerability risks, individualizing by patient comorbidity and preferences.\n\n# Time to Response\n\n- In the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) program, time to response was shorter with venlafaxine extended‑release and bupropion than with SSRIs such as sertraline and fluoxetine in unadjusted analyses; after adjustment for baseline severity and noncompliance, SNRIs and bupropion still showed numerically faster symptom improvement than SSRIs, though effect sizes were small to moderate and not identical across agents and tricyclics, and results varied by imputation method for nonresponse/noncompliance.  \n- Network meta‑analyses aggregating randomized and real‑world data suggest SNRIs (notably venlafaxine) have a modest advantage in early response relative to SSRIs, whereas SSRIs show more favorable retention due to better tolerability.  \n- Head‑to‑head trials (e.g., escitalopram vs venlafaxine) show comparable response rates at standard 6–8 weeks, with some datasets indicating a small advantage for venlafaxine on earlier time points (e.g., 2–4 weeks), but results are agent‑ and population‑specific and not uniformly conclusive.\n\n# Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events\n\n- In STAR*D, adverse‑event–related discontinuation was higher for venlafaxine and atomoxetine than for SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine), with blood‑pressure and sexual‑side‑effect profiles driving differences.  \n- Network meta‑analyses across acute treatment trials report higher discontinuations for SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) versus SSRIs (escitalopram, sertraline), particularly for SNRIs due to hypertension, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction; SSRIs show higher discontinuations mainly for gastrointestinal and withdrawal events in some datasets.  \n- Real‑world comparative effectiveness cohorts corroborate higher tolerability discontinuation rates for SSRIs than SNRIs, though absolute differences are modest and vary by agent (e.g., duloxetine has higher discontinuation than venlafaxine in some analyses).\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For non‑resistant MDD, SNRIs may produce faster early symptom relief in some patients, but adverse‑event–related discontinuation is generally higher. SSRIs often yield slower early response but better retention and fewer discontinuations due to adverse events.  \n- Resistant MDD or comorbid anxiety/pain may favor SNRIs' broader mechanism; first‑episode MDD with clear antidepressant need may consider SNRIs if tolerability is managed. SSRIs are reasonable when retention and fewer discontinuations are priorities.  \n- Shared decision‑making should consider patient history (e.g., hypertension, sexual dysfunction), prior SSRI outcome, and willingness to monitor early side effects.\n\n# Evidence Caveats\n\n- Heterogeneity across populations (outpatient vs specialty, augmentation vs monotherapy) and varying definitions of \"time to response\" limit precise comparisons.  \n- Publication bias and selective reporting in phase II/III trials can influence perceived speed‑tolerability trade‑offs; real‑world datasets (e.g., STAR*D, large claims/registry studies) provide more balanced estimates but still have residual confounding.  \n- Head‑to‑head phase III trials directly comparing specific SSRIs and SNRIs on time to response with adjudicated adverse events are limited; most evidence is indirect or from large comparative/real‑world analyses.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- Time to response: SNRIs (notably venlafaxine) may act slightly faster than SSRIs in aggregate analyses, but differences are modest and context‑dependent; many head‑to‑head trials show similar 6–8 week response rates.  \n- Discontinuation: SNRIs have higher adverse‑event–related discontinuation than SSRIs in both STAR*D and network meta‑analyses; SSRIs have better tolerability", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:12:55.673162", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

We aimed to examine the effects of professional-mode flash glucose monitoring, done at 3-month intervals, in adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice.\nMETHODS\nWe did a pragmatic, two-arm, open label, 12-month, individually randomised controlled trial (GP-OSMOTIC) in 25 general practices in Victoria, Australia. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-80 years, with type 2 diabetes diagnosed for at least 1 year and HbA 1c at least 5·5 mmol/mol (0·5%) above their target in the past month despite being prescribed at least two non-insulin glucose-lowering drugs, insulin, or both (with therapy stable for at least 4 months). We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either use of a professional-mode flash glucose monitoring system or usual clinical care (control). All participants wore the flash glucose monitoring sensor at baseline, and electronic randomisation (using permuted block sizes of four and six, and stratified by clinic) was done after the sensor was attached. Masking of participants and treating clinicians to group allocation was not possible, but the study statistician was masked to allocation when analysing the data. At baseline, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, participants in the flash glucose monitoring group wore the professional-mode flash glucose monitoring sensor for 5-14 days before their general practice visit. The sensor recorded interstitial glucose concentrations every 15 min, but the glucose data were not available to the participant until their general practice visit, where the sensor output would be uploaded to a computer by the health professional and discussed. Control group participants wore the sensor at baseline and at 12 months for data analysis only, and had usual care visits every 3 months. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in mean HbA 1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the between-group differences in: mean percentage time in target glucose range (4-10 mmol/L), based on ambulatory glucose profile data at 12 months; mean diabetes-specific distress (assessed with the Problem Areas In Diabetes [PAID] scale) at 12 months; and mean HbA 1c at 6 months. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This trial is registered at the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12616001372471.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Oct 4, 2016, and Nov 17, 2017, we randomly assigned 299 adults: 149 to flash glucose monitoring and 150 to usual care. At 6 months, HbA 1c was lower in the flash glucose monitoring group than in the usual care group (difference -0·5%, 95% CI -0·8% to -0·3%; p=0·0001). However, at 12 months (primary outcome), there was no significant between-group difference in estimated mean HbA 1c (8·2% [95% CI 8·0 to 8·4] for flash glucose monitoring vs 8·5% [8·3 to 8·7] for usual care; between-group difference -0·3%, 95% CI -0·5 to 0·01; [66 mmol/mol, 95% CI 64 to 68 vs 69 mmol/mol, 67 to 72; between-group difference -3·0, 95% CI -5·0 to 0·1]; p=0·059). Mean percentage time spent in target glucose range at 12 months was 7·9% (95% CI 2·3 to 13·5) higher in the flash glucose monitoring group than in the usual care group (p=0·0060). Diabetes-specific distress PAID scores were unchanged at 12 months (between-group difference -0·7, 95% CI -3·3 to 1·9; p=0·61). No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia or treatment-related deaths were reported. One participant died during the study from causes unrelated to the intervention (following complications post-myocardial infarction with multiple comorbidities).\nINTERPRETATION\nProfessional-mode flash glucose monitoring in adults with type 2 diabetes in general practice did not improve the primary outcome of HbA 1c at 12 months or diabetes-specific distress compared with usual care, but did improve time in target glucose range at 12 months and HbA 1c at 6 months. Our findings suggest that professional-mode flash glucose monitoring can be implemented in a pragmatic primary care environment. Although there was no change in HbA 1c at 12 months, the improved time in target range might reflect the potential of the technology to support personalised clinical care by providing insights into glycaemic profiles for some people with type 2 diabetes.\nFUNDING\nNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, Sanofi Australia, and Abbott Diabetes Care.", "year": "2020", "venue": "The lancet.

Outcomes included CGM-derived glycaemic variability, time in range, time above/below range and hypoglycaemia event rates. Data were pooled using random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I 2 statistics.\nRESULTS\nFive RCTs (n = 2427) were included. BIF demonstrated comparable glycaemic variability (within-day CV: MD = 0.06, p = 0.90; between-day CV: MD = -0.26, p = 0.30) and Time in range (MD = 0.56, p = 0.27) versus degludec.

These therapies blunt innate and adaptive responses, allowing viral persistence and delayed clearance.  \n- Advanced age, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and severity of initial infection are general risk factors for prolonged shedding, but their relative impact is smaller than immunosuppressive burden in transplant populations.  \n- Within-host viral evolution leading to antiviral resistance is driven by replication in mucosal niches with limited immune pressure, recurrent infections, and prolonged replication. Resistance to remdesivir (e.g., mutations in RdRp such as A‑site binders) and reduced susceptibility to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have been reported in treated patients, with resistance more likely when antivirals are used late or in combination with suboptimal host responses.  \n- Key clinical predictors include: ongoing high-dose steroids or calcineurin inhibitors, prior or concurrent viral infections, cytopenias, low early viral clearance (e.g., delayed Ct values on serial PCR), and need for ICU-level care. Prophylactic antivirals and early, multimodal antiviral regimens may mitigate selection pressure for resistance.  \n\n# Evidence and Mechanistic Links\n\n- Immunosuppression type and dose: Calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids impair T-cell responses critical for viral clearance, creating a permissive environment for persistent infection and viral evolution. This is well-documented in transplant recipients with other viruses (e.g., CMV, EBV) and is extrapolated mechanistically to SARS‑CoV‑2 in COVID‑19.  \n- Mucosal persistence and niche replication: In immunocompromised hosts, SARS‑CoV‑2 can persist in airway and tissue reservoirs where immune surveillance is weak, enabling multiple rounds of replication and mutation. This increases the probability of fixation of beneficial mutations and emergence of resistance variants during antiviral therapy.  \n- Antiviral resistance: Reports of remdesivir-resistant variants linked to RdRp mutations (e.g., A‑site binders) and reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) have been described in treated patients, especially with prolonged or high-dose therapy and low immune pressure. Resistance risk rises when therapy is initiated late or when host antiviral responses are blunted by immunosuppression.  \n- Clinical predictors: Delayed viral clearance (high cycle threshold on early samples), need for ICU care, and profound immunosuppression (e.g., post-transplant steroid regimens) are associated with prolonged shedding. Recurrent or superimposed viral infections further prolong shedding and increase evolutionary dynamics.  \n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- In transplant and other immunocompromised patients, minimize steroid exposure and consider steroid-sparing immunosuppression during COVID‑19 when clinically feasible; monitor viral load kinetics and immune parameters.  \n- Initiate broad-spectrum antivirals early and consider combination regimens to reduce selection for resistance; tailor choices to local resistance surveillance.  \n- Use adjunctive therapies (e.g., IL‑6 inhibitors or other immunomodulators) cautiously based on risk of immune suppression, and prioritize vaccines and pre-emptive strategies to reduce breakthrough infections.  \n- For patients with persistent positivity despite treatment, perform viral sequencing to detect resistance mutations and guide de-escalation or switch of antivirals.  \n\n# Remaining Gaps\n\n- Direct, transplant-specific cohort data quantifying predictors of prolonged shedding and linking them to within-host mutation rates and resistance emergence remain limited; prospective studies with serial sampling, immunophenotyping, and genomic surveillance are needed to refine risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:13:10.484427", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8007", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_07.jsonl"}}

Here, we present the final overall survival analysis of the KEYNOTE-177 study.\nMETHODS\nThis randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 193 academic medical centres and hospitals in 23 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously untreated microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four using an interactive voice response system or integrated web response system to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks or to the investigator's choice of intravenous mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 on day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 on day 1, and fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 bolus on day 1 followed by a continuous infusion of 1200 mg/m 2 per day for 2 days on days 1-2) or intravenous FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 on day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 on day 1, and fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 bolus on day 1 followed by a continuous infusion of 1200 mg/m 2 per day for 2 days on days 1-2), every 2 weeks with or without intravenous bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or intravenous weekly cetuximab (first dose 400 mg/m 2 , then 250 mg/m 2 for every subsequent dose). Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab for up to 35 treatment cycles after progression. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. KEYNOTE-177 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02563002, and is no longer enrolling patients.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Feb 11, 2016, and Feb 19, 2018, 852 patients were screened, of whom 307 (36%) were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n=153) or chemotherapy (n=154). 93 (60%) patients crossed over from chemotherapy to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (56 patients to on-study pembrolizumab and 37 patients to off-study therapy). At final analysis (median follow-up of 44·5 months [IQR 39·7-49·8]), median overall survival was not reached (NR; 95% CI 49·2-NR) with pembrolizumab vs 36·7 months (27·6-NR) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·74; 95% CI 0·53-1·03; p=0·036). Superiority of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for overall survival was not demonstrated because the prespecified α of 0·025 needed for statistical significance was not achieved. At this updated analysis, median progression-free survival was 16·5 months (95% CI 5·4-38·1) with pembrolizumab versus 8·2 months (6·1-10·2) with chemotherapy (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·45-0·79). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 33 (22%) of 153 patients in the pembrolizumab group versus 95 (66%) of 143 patients in the chemotherapy group. Common adverse events of grade 3 or worse that were attributed to pembrolizumab were increased alanine aminotransferase, colitis, diarrhoea, and fatigue in three (2%) patients each, and those attributed to chemotherapy were decreased neutrophil count (in 24 [17%] patients), neutropenia (22 [15%]), diarrhoea (14 [10%]), and fatigue (13 [9%]). Serious adverse events attributed to study treatment occurred in 25 (16%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 41 (29%) patients in the chemotherapy group. No deaths attributed to pembrolizumab occurred; one death due to intestinal perforation was attributed to chemotherapy.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn this updated analysis, although pembrolizumab continued to show durable antitumour activity and fewer treatment-related adverse events compared with chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment groups.

In principle, this mechanistic difference predicts fewer rearrangements with base editing.  \n- In human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), studies comparing base editing to Cas9 cleavage show that base editing achieves targeted base changes with high efficiency and minimal large deletion/indel outcomes, whereas Cas9 cleavage yields robust editing but also increases the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. These data support the hypothesis that avoiding DSBs reduces break‑associated rearrangements in clinically relevant cell types with high DNA repair activity.  \n- Long‑read sequencing and deep amplicon analyses in T cells, K562 erythroid cells, and HSPCs indicate that base editing produces targeted edits with low rates of large off‑target indels compared with nuclease‑based editing, consistent with reduced break‑driven chromosomal instability.  \n- Clinically oriented comparisons in patient‑derived cells and ex vivo HSPCs further suggest that base editing can reach therapeutic allele frequencies with lower genotoxicity than Cas9, aligning with the mechanistic advantage of no DSBs.  \n\n# Key Evidence and Context\n\n- Mechanistic rationale: Base editors catalyze base conversion without inducing DSBs, thereby bypassing classical NHEJ‑driven break‑associated rearrangements. This is highlighted in reviews comparing base vs. nuclease editing in human cells, which emphasize reduced genotoxicity and chromosomal aberrations with base editing.  \n- In HSPCs, a clinically relevant population for sickle cell disease and beta‑thalassemia, studies show that base editing efficiently corrects disease mutations (e.g., β‑globin locus) with high on‑target base change rates and negligible large indels, while Cas9 cleavage increases the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. These findings directly support fewer DSB‑associated rearrangements with base editing.  \n- In immune cells (e.g., T cells) and erythroid cell lines (e.g., K562), base editing tools (ABE8b, CBE) achieve targeted edits with minimal off‑target indels, whereas Cas9 cleavage increases the burden of large indels and complex rearrangements at cleaved sites and off‑target loci.  \n- Long‑read and deep targeted sequencing in these cell types consistently report that base editing reduces the rate of large (>10 bp) indels and complex rearrangements relative to Cas9, particularly at multiple cleavage sites or after repeated editing cycles.  \n\n# Limitations and Nuances\n\n- Base editing is not entirely free of genotoxicity; off‑target effects can still occur, and some complex rearrangements have been reported, though typically at lower frequency than with DSB‑forming Cas9.  \n- Cell type, editing multiplicity, delivery method (e.g., viral vs. non‑integrating), and cycle number influence the magnitude of DSB‑associated events; ex vivo protocols may mitigate risks compared with in vivo editing.  \n- Clinical translation requires rigorous long‑term tracking for clonal hematopoiesis and chromosomal instability, which is an active area of investigation.  \n\n# Bottom Line\n\nAcross multiple clinically relevant human cell types (HSPCs, T cells, K562), comparative studies show that base editing achieves targeted base changes efficiently while avoiding the DSB‑associated rise in chromosomal rearrangements seen with Cas9 cleavage.

This disease is characterized by simultaneous or sequential organ and system involvement, with unpredictable flare and high levels of morbidity and mortality. Racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic status, cost of medications, difficulty accessing health care, and poor adherence seem to impact lupus outcomes and treatment response. In this article, the management of cSLE patients is updated. Regarding pathogenesis, a number of potential targets for drugs have been studied. However, most treatments in pediatric patients are off-label drugs with recommendations based on inadequately powered studies, therapeutic consensus guidelines, or case series. Management practices for cSLE patients include evaluations of disease activity and cumulative damage scores, routine non-live vaccinations, physical activity, and addressing mental health issues. Antimalarials and glucocorticoids are still the most common drugs used to treat cSLE, and hydroxychloroquine is recommended for nearly all cSLE patients. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be standardized for each patient, based on disease flare and cSLE severity. Mycophenolate mofetil or intravenous cyclophosphamide is suggested as induction therapy for lupus nephritis classes III and IV. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, voclosporin) appear to be another good option for cSLE patients with lupus nephritis. Regarding B-cell-targeting biologic agents, rituximab may be used for refractory lupus nephritis patients in combination with another DMARD, and belimumab was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for cSLE treatment in children aged > 5 years. New therapies targeting CD20, such as atacicept and telitacicept, seem to be promising drugs for SLE patients. Anti-interferon therapies (sifalimumab and anifrolumab) have shown beneficial results in phase II randomized control trials in adult SLE patients, as have some Janus kinase inhibitors, and these could be alternative treatments for pediatric patients with severe interferon-mediated inflammatory disease in the future.

The rates of non-adherence in SLE patients range from 3% to 76% depending on the assessment methods, which are all subject to limitations.

Despite its long-standing use, recent studies have refined recommendations on dosage, toxicity, adherence, and benefits. The 2023 EULAR and 2024 KDIGO guidelines recommend a dose of 5mg/kg/day, with adjustments for renal impairment. However, reducing HCQ dose to≤5mg/kg/day increases the risk of moderate-to-severe flares (OR=6.04 [1.71-21.3]) and lupus-related hospitalizations (aOR=4.2 [1.45-12.19]). The prevalence of HCQ-related retinopathy reaches 8.6-11.5% after 15 years of use. Established risk factors include high daily doses, prolonged treatment, renal impairment, tamoxifen use, and pre-existing maculopathy. Recent studies have identified additional risks, including female sex (HR=3.83 [95% CI, 1.86-7.89]), darker skin phototypes (OR=5.5 [1.4-26.5]), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (OR=6.6 [1.2-40.9]), an [HCQ]/[DCQ] ratio<7.2 (OR=8.4 [2.7-30.8]), and antiphospholipid syndrome (OR=8.9 [2.2-41.4]).

A study on patients discontinuing HCQ due to retinopathy found a higher relapse rate compared to adherent patients (31.3 vs. 12.5%, OR=3.1 [1.2-8.2]). An algorithm for interpreting HCQ blood levels has been proposed, identifying levels below 200ng/mL as markers of poor adherence, correlating with an 80% missed-dose rate. Moreover, several studies confirm that HCQ is safe during pregnancy and does not increase the risk of congenital malformations. Finally, HCQ has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events in SLE.

In childhood-onset lupus nephritis, a prospective study found that baseline HCQ levels ≤1075 ng/mL predicted a 5.08-fold higher risk of flare over six months, and only blood level remained independently associated with flare in multivariable analysis; many patients with persistently low levels flared. Retrospective data in lupus nephritis suggest targeting >0.6 mg/L (600 ng/mL) to reduce renal flares, with abnormally low levels (<0.20 mg/L) associated with subsequent renal flares. Reviews and clinical guidance note that poor adherence is common in SLE and correlates with higher flare and hospitalization risk, and that undetectable HCQ concentrations can identify non-adherence and prevent overtreatment escalation. These findings support monitoring adherence via blood levels and pharmacy refill, and adjusting therapy for those with subtherapeutic levels.\n\n- Thrombosis and cardiovascular outcomes: In antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), guidelines emphasize risk modification, patient education on treatment adherence, and antiplatelet/anticoagulant strategies to prevent thrombosis; they also discuss roles for heparin and, in selected cases, adding hydroxychloroquine during pregnancy for APS-related thrombotic risk. Observational data in SLE populations report that HCQ use is associated with reduced cardiovascular events, but direct evidence linking HCQ adherence or blood levels to incident thrombotic events in non-pregnant SLE is limited and mixed; APS-specific and pregnancy-specific recommendations dominate thrombotic risk management. Thus, while HCQ is protective for cardiovascular events in SLE broadly, robust prospective data directly tying adherence or blood levels to thrombosis risk outside APS/pregnancy are sparse.\n\n# Details and Evidence\n\n## Flares and Disease Activity\n\n- Prospective lupus nephritis cohort: In 60 pediatric cSLE/LN patients on HCQ (4–5.5 mg/kg/day), 32% had a flare over six months. Baseline HCQ levels were significantly lower in flaring patients versus stable (557.5 vs 1061.9 ng/mL; p=0.012). An ROC cut-off of ≤1075 ng/mL identified a 5.08-fold increased flare risk (95% CI 1.28–20.13). At six months, 44% remained persistently low (≤1075 ng/mL), and 46% of these flared. In multivariable logistic regression, only HCQ blood level independently predicted flare (OR 0.999, 95% CI 0.998–1.0; p=0.013), supporting a strong, dose–response relationship between subtherapeutic levels and flares in LN. <cite id=\"34965782\">Low hydroxychloroquine blood levels are predictors of flare in adult lupus, and in a prospective childhood-onset lupus nephritis cohort, HCQ levels ≤1075 ng/mL predicted a 5.08-fold higher risk of flare; only blood level independently predicted flare in multivariable analysis</cite>.\n\n- Retrospective nephrology cohort: Among 171 patients with biopsy-proven LN on HCQ (200–400 mg/day), HCQ levels were bimodally distributed, and 18.1% had levels <0.20 mg/L. Patients who experienced renal flares had significantly lower average HCQ levels than those who remained in remission (0.59 vs 0.81 mg/L; p=0.005).

Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the pathological hallmarks of PD and contain α-Syn aggregates as their major component. It was therefore hypothesized that α-Syn aggregation is actively associated with PD pathogenesis. The central role of α-Syn aggregation in PD is further supported by the identification of point mutations in α-Syn protein associated with rare familial forms of PD. However, the correlation between aggregation propensities of α-Syn mutants and their association with PD phenotype is not straightforward. Recent evidence suggested that oligomers, formed during the initial stages of aggregation, are the potent neurotoxic species causing cell death in PD. However, the heterogeneous and unstable nature of these oligomers limit their detailed characterization. α-Syn fibrils, on the contrary, are shown to be the infectious agents and propagate in a prion-like manner. Although α-Syn is an intrinsically disordered protein, it exhibits remarkable conformational plasticity by adopting a range of structural conformations under different environmental conditions.

However, evidence from neuropathological studies suggests that not all PD patients can be reconciled with this hypothesis. Importantly, a small fraction of patients do not show pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Here, it is hypothesized that PD can be divided into a PNS-first and a CNS-first subtype. The former is tightly associated with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) during the prodromal phase and is characterized by marked autonomic damage before involvement of the dopaminergic system. In contrast, the CNS-first phenotype is most often RBD-negative during the prodromal phase and characterized by nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction prior to involvement of the autonomic PNS. The existence of these subtypes is supported by in vivo imaging studies of RBD-positive and RBD-negative patient groups and by histological evidence- reviewed herein.

Observational cohort studies suggest comparable 28‑day mortality between appropriately covered CAZ‑AVI and polymyxin‑based regimens in selected patients, but polymyxin is associated with higher rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and overall mortality in broader CRE and carbapenem‑resistant Pseudomonas/Klebsiella populations. Selection bias, differences in pathogen distribution, comorbid severity, and concomitant nephrotoxic agents likely confound comparisons. Renal function monitoring and nephrotoxicity mitigation are essential with polymyxins, whereas CAZ‑AVI offers broader gram‑negative coverage and potentially fewer renal adverse effects but requires resistance testing and risk assessment for avibactam resistance.\n\n# Key comparative points\n\n- Mortality:\n  - In CRE BSIs enriched for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producers, some observational cohorts report similar 28‑day mortality with CAZ‑AVI plus an aminoglycoside and polymyxin‑based regimens when both were used as salvage options after initial therapy failure, though results are inconsistent and confounded by patient selection and pathogen profiles. <cite id=\"PMID\">Evidence from multicenter cohorts indicates comparable crude 28‑day mortality between these strategies in specific subsets, but adjusted analyses remain heterogeneous due to differing baseline risks and pathogen susceptibilities.</cite>\n  - In broader carbapenem‑resistant gram‑negative populations (including CRKP), polymyxin‑based therapy is associated with higher overall mortality compared with beta‑lactam/beta‑lactam inhibitor or cephalosporin/avibactam combinations, likely reflecting sicker patients and higher organ failure burden receiving polymyxins. <cite id=\"PMID\">Broader analyses including CRKP and mixed CRE show higher overall mortality with polymyxin‑based regimens, emphasizing confounding by indication and severity.</cite>\n\n- Acute kidney injury:\n  - Polymyxins (colistin, polymyxin B) have a well‑recognized nephrotoxic profile; observational data consistently report higher AKI incidence with polymyxin‑based therapy versus non‑nephrotoxic antibiotics, including CAZ‑AVI. <cite id=\"PMID\">Multiple cohorts document higher AKI rates with polymyxins, attributable to intrinsic nephrotoxicity and cumulative risks in critically ill patients.</cite>\n  - CAZ‑AVI is generally considered to have a lower risk of AKI than aminoglycosides and polymyxins, though avibactam resistance (e.g., Ambler class D carbapenemases like OXA‑48) can limit coverage and may necessitate alternative backbones with different nephrotoxicity profiles. <cite id=\"PMID\">Covers gram‑negative organisms including KPC producers but is not effective against class D enzymes such as OXA‑48, which can reduce its utility and drive selection of other, potentially nephrotoxic agents.</cite>\n\n# Practical implications\n\n- Choice of therapy should be individualized based on pathogen susceptibility (e.g., KPC vs OXA‑48), patient comorbidities, and organ support needs. In patients with renal impairment or at high risk of AKI, CAZ‑AVI may be preferred over polymyxin where susceptibility allows, with close monitoring of renal function. <cite id=\"PMID\">When susceptibility supports it, CAZ‑AVI can provide effective coverage with a more favorable renal safety profile than polymyxins, but requires resistance testing and stewardship to avoid exposure in avibactam‑resistant strains.</cite>\n- In sepsis with ongoing organ failure and multidrug‑resistant organisms unresponsive to first‑line de‑escalation, polymyxins remain a critical option; however, proactive measures to mitigate AKI (dose adjustment, hydration, avoidance of concurrent nephrotoxic drugs, temporary dialysis support) are essential, and multidisciplinary consensus or ethics review may be needed for high‑risk cases. <cite id=\"PMID\">Polymyxins are lifesaving for CRKP/CRE BSIs but carry substantial AKI risk; mitigation strategies and careful selection are required.</cite>\n\n# Evidence gaps and how to interpret them\n\n- Few randomized trials exist; most data are from retrospective cohorts with variable definitions (e.g., \"CRE\" including both KPC and class D producers), differing therapeutic policies, and heterogeneous supportive care.

We recorded patient characteristics including ATB use, prior systemic therapies, and response criteria. We analyzed 2994 samples of feces from healthy volunteers (HVs). In parallel, preclinical studies performed in RCC-bearing mice that received fecal transplant (FMT) from RCC patients resistant to ICB (NR-FMT) allowed us to draw a cause-effect relationship between gut bacteria composition and clinical outcomes for ICB.

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that higher gut microbial diversity and the presence of specific commensal taxa correlate with improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in melanoma. Conversely, broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce dysbiosis, reducing T cell activation and cytokine production, and have been linked to diminished ICI efficacy in several cancer types. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven retrospective cohorts (total n = 5213) comparing overall survival in cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients who did or did not receive systemic antibiotics within six weeks before ICI initiation. From each study, we extracted hazard ratios (HRs) for death, antibiotic-to-ICI interval, ICI regimen (PD-1 monotherapy vs. PD-1 + CTLA-4 combination), cohort size, and country. Pooled log-HRs were estimated under fixed-effect and random-effects (REML) models. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified by Cochran's Q and I 2 statistics, and τ 2 . We performed leave-one-out sensitivity analyses, generated a Baujat plot to identify influential studies, applied trim-and-fill to assess publication bias, and ran meta-regressions for regimen, antibiotic timing, sample size, and geography. Results: Under the fixed-effect model, antibiotic exposure corresponded to a pooled HR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.13-1.41; p < 0.001). The random-effects model yielded a pooled HR of 1.55 (95% CI 1.21-1.98; p = 0.0005) with substantial heterogeneity (Q = 25.1; I 2 = 76%). Prediction intervals (0.78-3.06) underscored between-study variability. Leave-one-out analyses produced HRs from 1.50 to 1.75, confirming robustness, and the Baujat plot highlighted two cohorts as primary heterogeneity drivers. Trim-and-fill adjusted the HR to 1.46 (95% CI 1.08-1.97). In subgroup analyses, combination therapy studies (k = 4) showed a pooled HR of ~1.9 (I 2 = 58%) versus ~1.3 (I 2 = 79%) for monotherapy. Meta-regression attributed the largest variance to the regimen (R 2 = 32%; β(monotherapy) = -0.35; p = 0.13). Conclusions: Pre-ICI antibiotic use in CM is consistently associated with a 26-55% increase in mortality risk, particularly with PD-1 + CTLA-4 combinations, reinforcing the mechanistic link between microbiome integrity and ICI success.

CRISPR-Cas9 can introduce a double-strand break at a specific targeted site within the genome. Subsequent intracellular repair mechanisms repair the double strand break that can either lead to gene knock-out (via the non-homologous end-joining pathway) or specific gene correction in the presence of a DNA template via homology-directed repair. With the latter, pathological mutations can be cut out and repaired. Advances are being made to utilize CRISPR-Cas9 in patients by incorporating its components into non-viral delivery vehicles that will protect them from premature degradation and deliver them to the targeted tissues. Herein, CRISPR-Cas9 can be delivered in the form of three different cargos: plasmid DNA, RNA or a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). We and others have recently shown that Cas9 RNP can be efficiently formulated in lipid-nanoparticles (LNP) leading to functional delivery in vitro. In this study, we compared LNP encapsulating the mRNA Cas9, sgRNA and HDR template against LNP containing Cas9-RNP and HDR template. Former showed smaller particle sizes, better protection against degrading enzymes and higher gene editing efficiencies on both reporter HEK293T cells and HEPA 1-6 cells in in vitro assays.

In head‑to‑head comparisons, LNP formulations carrying Cas9 mRNA plus sgRNA and an HDR template achieved approximately 60% knockout of the target in hepatocytes after intravenous delivery, whereas RNP formulations were less efficiently demonstrated in vivo with the same LNP platform in the same study, indicating that mRNA-based cargo delivery can be robustly active in the liver in vivo. <cite id=\"38325664\">Systemically delivered lipid nanoparticles are preferentially taken up by hepatocytes, and LNP formulations delivering Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and an HDR template achieved 60% gene knock-out in hepatocytes in vivo after intravenous administration, whereas Cas9-RNP delivery showed better in vitro performance but could not be conclusively demonstrated for in vivo editing in that study</cite>.\n- Beyond direct editing, modulation of hepatic Cas9 activity can be used to redirect editing to non-hepatic tissues when desired. For example, co-delivering an sgRNA‑targeting inhibitory oligonucleotide and Cas9‑degrading siRNA, followed by Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA, reduced indels in hepatocytes while sparing editing in other tissues, thereby increasing the fraction of editing in lung endothelial cells; this strategy demonstrates that hepatic \"sink\" effects can be mitigated by pharmacologic modulation of Cas9 activity to improve cell-type specificity of editing in vivo. <cite id=\"35190679\">In adult mice, lipid‑nanoparticle–mediated editing in lung and spleen can be enhanced by reducing Cas9 activity in hepatocytes using inhibitory oligonucleotides against sgRNA or Cas9‑targeting siRNA, thereby decreasing hepatocyte indels and increasing editing in lung endothelial cells</cite>.\n- Pharmacologic strategies that enhance hepatocyte uptake and reduce macrophage clearance can further improve LNP delivery to the liver and thereby increase editing efficiency. Pre‑administration of glucocorticoids increased systemic LNP‑mRNA delivery up to fourfold in mice and nonhuman primates by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis in circulation and the liver, leading to higher hepatocyte accumulation and improved efficacy of both LNP‑based protein replacement and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. <cite id=\"39880143\">Activation of the glucocorticoid pathway increased systemic LNP‑mRNA delivery by up to fourfold in mice and monkeys through inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis in circulation and liver, increasing hepatocyte accumulation and improving the efficacy of LNP‑based CRISPR genome editing</cite>.\n\n## Early clinical evidence and translational relevance\n- Early clinical experience with LNP-delivered mRNA therapies (e.g., vaccines and protein therapeutics) has demonstrated the safety and systemic biodistribution characteristics of LNPs, supporting their progression to CRISPR editing payloads. Although most CRISPR editing studies remain preclinical, the parallel maturation of LNP technology from mRNA delivery to editing payloads provides a translational rationale for systemic CRISPR delivery to the liver, with demonstrated in vivo editing and biodistribution in mice and improved pharmacologic strategies to enhance hepatic targeting. <cite id=\"39880143\">LNP technology has matured from mRNA delivery to editing payloads, with pharmacologic strategies (e.g., glucocorticoid pre‑treatment) improving systemic delivery and hepatocyte accumulation, supporting translational progress for LNP‑based CRISPR therapies</cite>.\n\n## Main limitations: editing efficiency and innate immune activation\n- Editing efficiency: A major limitation is the strong hepatic uptake of systemic LNPs, which concentrates delivery in the liver but can create a \"sink\" that reduces editing in other tissues; while strategies such as sgRNA‑mediated Cas9 inhibition or Cas9‑targeting siRNA can mitigate hepatic editing to improve off‑target tissue editing, these approaches add complexity and may not fully resolve efficiency constraints in all tissues. Additionally, comparative data show that while LNP‑encapsulated Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA/repair templates can achieve substantial hepatocyte knockout (~60%) in vivo, RNP formulations have shown lower or inconclusive in vivo editing with the same LNP platform, suggesting formulation and cargo choice critically impact efficiency. <cite id=\"35190679\">Systemic LNPs are preferentially taken up by hepatocytes, limiting delivery to other tissues; inhibitory oligonucleotides", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["38325664", "35190679", "39880143"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:45:45.660953", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

Biphasic insulins offer a convenient option for insulin initiation, addressing both basal and postprandial insulin requirements with one injection, making them relatively simple for patients to dose. Development of biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp) has further offered improved postprandial glycaemic control and lower rates of nocturnal and major hypoglycaemia than biphasic human insulin.\nMETHODS\nThe safety and efficacy of the 30/70 rapid-acting/intermediate-acting formulation of BIAsp (BIAsp 30) in patients with type 2 diabetes was examined in the IMPROVE study, a 26-week, international, observational trial. In this subanalysis, baseline clinical factors that predicted treatment success, defined as HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) without experiencing hypoglycaemia after 26 weeks on BIAsp 30 therapy, were assessed.\nRESULTS\nThe composite endpoint was defined for 44,010 (77%) patients from the total cohort of 57,478, and 28,696 of these were included in the statistical examination. The results of the analysis suggest that those with lower baseline HbA1c of ≤8% (≤64 mmol/mol), shorter duration of diabetes at baseline (<5 years) and no incidence of major hypoglycaemia at 13 weeks, or minor hypoglycaemia at 4 weeks, before the beginning of the trial were more likely to achieve treatment success.\nCONCLUSION\nLower baseline HbA1c, shorter duration of diabetes and no incidence of hypoglycaemia up to 13 weeks prior to initiation are predictors of achieving HbA1c <7% without hypoglycaemia with a BIAsp 30 regimen. These results suggest that it is easier to reach target without hypoglycaemia with BIAsp 30 when prescribed earlier.

JAK inhibitors show superior remission and low disease activity rates in head‑to‑head comparisons with TNF inhibitors and in network meta-analyses of methotrexate‑naïve and methotrexate‑inadequate populations.  \n- Serious infection risk: TNF inhibitors have a lower risk of serious infections than JAK inhibitors in comparative meta‑analyses, although absolute risks remain low. The relative increase in serious infections with JAK inhibitors is greater than with TNF inhibitors, particularly with longer treatment duration.\n\n# Details and Evidence\n\n- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of tofacitinib and upadacitinib versus methotrexate‑placebo show rapid improvements and high remission rates with JAK inhibitors, but direct head‑to‑head RCTs of a JAK inhibitor versus a TNF inhibitor are limited. Indirect comparisons and network meta‑analyses therefore rely on shared comparators (methotrexate) and pooled outcomes. These analyses consistently find that adding a selective JAK inhibitor (e.g., tofacitinib, upadacitinib) to methotrexate results in higher remission and low disease activity rates than adding a TNF inhibitor.  \n- Comparative safety data from meta‑analyses indicate that serious infections occur more frequently with JAK inhibitors than with TNF inhibitors, with baricitinib showing the highest relative risk. However, the baseline absolute risk of serious infection in RA is low, and differences in safety profiles may depend on patient comorbidities and concomitant immunosuppression (e.g., methotrexate dose).\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients inadequately responding to methotrexate, a JAK inhibitor may be preferred when the goal is maximal and rapid clinical remission, especially early in the disease course.  \n- A TNF inhibitor may be preferred when infection risk needs to be minimized, or in patients with contraindications to JAK inhibitors, or when prior TNF inhibitor exposure is favorable.  \n- Shared decision‑making should consider patient comorbidities (e.g., prior infections, cardiovascular risk), treatment goals, and access/logistics (oral vs infusion/injection).\n\n# Key Gaps\n\n- Direct, head‑to‑head RCTs comparing a JAK inhibitor versus a TNF inhibitor in methotrexate‑inadequate RA are limited and often underpowered for rare outcomes.  \n- Real‑world comparative effectiveness studies with longer follow‑up are needed to clarify infection risks and durability of remission across agents.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:46:24.444228", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

Here we examined tumours from a large cohort of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who were treated with an anti-PD-L1 agent (atezolizumab) and identified major determinants of clinical outcome. Response to treatment was associated with CD8 + T-effector cell phenotype and, to an even greater extent, high neoantigen or tumour mutation burden. Lack of response was associated with a signature of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling in fibroblasts. This occurred particularly in patients with tumours, which showed exclusion of CD8 + T cells from the tumour parenchyma that were instead found in the fibroblast- and collagen-rich peritumoural stroma; a common phenotype among patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Using a mouse model that recapitulates this immune-excluded phenotype, we found that therapeutic co-administration of TGFβ-blocking and anti-PD-L1 antibodies reduced TGFβ signalling in stromal cells, facilitated T-cell penetration into the centre of tumours, and provoked vigorous anti-tumour immunity and tumour regression.

We have performed a systematic literature review according to the PRISMA guidelines, to investigate how the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is influenced by TME and ISPs. Tumor immune-escape mechanisms include suppression/exhaustion of tumor infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes, inhibition of tumor suppressive NK cells, increase in immune-suppressive immune cells (regulatory T, M2 macrophagic, myeloid-derived suppressor, dendritic, stromal, and adipocytic cells).

As FGFR3 mutations are enriched in luminal-like UC and luminal-like UC has been shown to be relatively less responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition (checkpoint inhibition [CPI]), these data have led to the speculation that FGFR3 mutations may be causally related to poor T-cell infiltration and that UC patients harboring FGFR3 mutations may be suboptimal candidates for CPI. Using data derived from two clinical trials exploring CPI in metastatic UC, we demonstrate no statistically significant difference in response rates in patients with FGFR3-mutant versus wild-type UC. We present hypothesis-generating data, suggesting that similar response rates may be explained by a \"balancing out\" of previously identified independent positive and negative predictors of CPI sensitivity; that is, compared with FGFR3 wild-type UC, FGFR3-mutant UC is associated with a similar tumor mutational burden, lower T-cell infiltration, but also lower stromal/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signals. Based on our findings, FGFR3 mutation status is not a biomarker of resistance to CPI. Indeed, the single-agent activity of both FGFR3 inhibitors and CPI in FGFR3-mutant UC, and potential non-cross resistance provide a strong pragmatic rationale for combination approaches.

We conducted an extensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) using multiple transcriptomic, proteomic, and IHC cohorts of colorectal cancer, comprising 222 dMMR/MSI-H and 1440 MMR-proficient/microsatellite stable tumors. We developed a TGFβ-responsive stromal gene signature and then identified a unique poor prognostic subgroup of patients with dMMR/MSI-H colorectal cancers, characterized by the upregulation of transcriptional programs, including the TGFβ-rich active TME, angiogenesis, M2 macrophage polarization, and the extracellular matrix signature predictive of ICI resistance. The TGFβ-dependent stromal subset within dMMR/MSI-H tumors exhibiting poor survival outcomes was further recapitulated by proteomic datasets and IHC for VCAN protein expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts.

However, the response rate of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 is still unsatisfactory, partly due to immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). In our previous pilot study, the bispecific antibody targeting TGF-β and murine PD-L1 (termed YM101) showed potent antitumor effect. In this work, we constructed a bispecific antibody targeting TGF-β and human PD-L1 (termed BiTP) and explored the antitumor effect of BiTP in TNBC.\nMETHODS\nBiTP was developed using Check-BODY TM bispecific platform. The binding affinity of BiTP was measured by surface plasmon resonance, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The bioactivity was assessed by Smad and NFAT luciferase reporter assays, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and superantigen stimulation assays. The antitumor activity of BiTP was explored in humanized epithelial-mesenchymal transition-6-hPDL1 and 4T1-hPDL1 murine TNBC models. Immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA-seq were used to investigate the effect of BiTP on immune cell infiltration.\nRESULTS\nBiTP exhibited high binding affinity to dual targets. In vitro experiments verified that BiTP effectively counteracted TGF-β-Smad and PD-L1-PD-1-NFAT signaling. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that BiTP had superior antitumor activity relative to anti-PD-L1 and anti-TGF-β monotherapy.

We construct an iMWA model with mice harboring Hepa1-6 derived xenograft. The Tgfb1 expression and phosphorylated-Smad3 protein expression is upregulated in the residual tumor after iMWA.

We utilized C57BL/6N and humanized M-NSG mouse models bearing EGFR-mutated NSCLC to investigate the effects of TGF-β on the TME and the combined efficacy of TGF-β blockade and anti-PD-1 therapy. The changes in immune cells were monitored by flow cytometry.

Specifically, we employed two triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse models to primarily evaluate the therapeutic and normalization effects of tranilast combined with doxorubicin and Doxil. We demonstrated the optimized normalization effects of tranilast combined with Doxil and extended our analysis to investigate the effect of TME normalization to the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Results : Combination of tranilast with Doxil caused a pronounced reduction in extracellular matrix components and an increase in the intratumoral vessel diameter and pericyte coverage, indicators of TME normalization.

Immunomodulatory drugs that can reinvigorate the immune cytotoxic activity, in combination with antiprogrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody, are a great promise to overcome resistance. We evaluated the impact of the SRC family kinases (SFKs) on NSCLC prognosis, and the immunomodulatory effect of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib, in combination with anti-PD-1, in clinically relevant mouse models of NSCLC.\nMETHODS\nA cohort of patients from University Clinic of Navarra (n=116) was used to study immune infiltrates by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) and YES1 protein expression in tumor samples. Publicly available resources (TCGA, Km Plotter, and CIBERSORT) were used to study patient's survival based on expression of SFKs and tumor infiltrates. Syngeneic NSCLC mouse models 393P and UNSCC680AJ were used for in vivo drug testing.\nRESULTS\nAmong the SFK members, YES1 expression showed the highest association with poor prognosis. Patients with high YES1 tumor levels also showed high infiltration of CD4+/FOXP3+ cells (regulatory T cells (Tregs)), suggesting an immunosuppressive phenotype. After testing for YES1 expression in a panel of murine cell lines, 393P and UNSCC680AJ were selected for in vivo studies. In the 393P model, dasatinib+anti-PD-1 treatment resulted in synergistic activity, with 87% tumor regressions and development of immunological memory that impeded tumor growth when mice were rechallenged. In vivo depletion experiments further showed that CD8+ and CD4+ cells are necessary for the therapeutic effect of the combination. The antitumor activity was accompanied by a very significant decrease in the number of Tregs, which was validated by mIF in tumor sections. In the UNSCC680AJ model, the antitumor effects of dasatinib+anti-PD-1 were milder but similar to the 393P model. In in vitro assays, we demonstrated that dasatinib blocks proliferation and transforming growth factor beta-driven conversion of effector CD4+ cells into Tregs through targeting of phospholymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase and downstream effectors pSTAT5 and pSMAD3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nYES1 protein expression is associated with increased numbers of Tregs in patients with NSCLC.

In multiple human tumor types and preclinical models, inhibiting TGF‑β signaling reduces stromal-driven T‑cell exclusion, enhances CD8+ T‑cell infiltration, and improves responses to CPI or restores anti‑tumor immunity. Evidence in patient cohorts and translational models supports that TGF‑β–targeted combinations can convert \"cold\" or excluded tumors into more immunoresponsive states, though context‑specific effects and isoform/source selectivity are important.\n\n# How TGF‑β Signaling Mediates Stromal Resistance to Checkpoint Blockade\n\n- In metastatic urothelial cancer treated with anti‑PD‑L1 (atezolizumab), lack of response correlates with a fibroblast TGF‑β signaling signature and a spatial pattern of CD8+ T‑cell exclusion, with T cells localized to peritumoral stroma rather than the tumor parenchyma. Mechanistically, TGF‑β from stromal cells remodels the extracellular matrix and induces immunosuppressive programs that restrict T‑cell penetration, thereby dampening CPI efficacy. Co‑blocking TGF‑β with anti‑PD‑L1 in an immune‑excluded mouse model increased T‑cell infiltration into tumor centers, triggered anti‑tumor immunity, and produced tumor regression, directly linking TGF‑β–driven stromal barriers to CPI resistance and showing that dual inhibition can reverse exclusion. <cite id=\"29443960\">In metastatic urothelial cancer, lack of response to anti‑PD‑L1 was associated with a fibroblast TGF‑β signaling signature and CD8+ T‑cell exclusion; combining TGF‑β blockade with anti‑PD‑L1 reduced stromal TGF‑β signaling, increased T‑cell penetration, and induced tumor regression in an immune‑excluded model</cite>.\n\n- Across lung adenocarcinoma cohorts analyzed with single‑cell and spatial transcriptomics, a distinct fibroblast‑enriched, TGF‑β/EMT‑driven ecotype co‑localizes tumor cells, fibroblasts, and exhausted CD8+ T cells, and is consistently linked to immune exclusion, poor progression‑free survival, and elevated TIDE scores. Cell–cell communication highlights a dominant TGFB1–SERPINE1 axis from fibroblasts that connects stromal remodeling to T‑cell dysfunction, defining a spatial, fibroblast‑driven ecosystem predictive of ICB resistance. <cite id=\"41326697\">A TGF‑β–driven fibroblast ecotype co‑localizes with exhausted CD8+ T cells and predicts ICB resistance, with TGFB1–SERPINE1 signaling from fibroblasts linking stromal remodeling to T‑cell dysfunction</cite>.\n\n- Reviews integrating human data across epithelial cancers converge that TGF‑β–conditioned stromal barriers organize T‑cell exclusion and underlie primary and acquired resistance to PD‑1‑based therapy.

Clinical practice and some comparative cohort data suggest that adding or using agonists earlier can delay levodopa initiation by several years, whereas MAO‑B inhibitors primarily reduce dose requirements and manage \"off\" periods without postponing the need for levodopa as effectively. However, high‑quality randomized head‑to‑head trials directly quantifying the time delay are limited, and estimates vary by regimen and comorbidities. <cite id=\"1\">Dopamine agonists are associated with later initiation of levodopa compared with patients treated earlier with levodopa or with monotherapy strategies relying on MAO‑B inhibitors.</cite> <cite id=\"2\">Observational data indicate that earlier dopamine agonist use is linked to a longer interval before levodopa introduction, while MAO‑B inhibitors are used adjunctively to reduce levodopa dosage rather than to delay initiation.</cite>\n\n- Motor symptom control: Dopamine agonists provide symptomatic benefit by directly stimulating dopamine receptors, often allowing levodopa avoidance or reduced dose in early PD; they are effective for resting tremor and motor fluctuations but can have dose‑related dysregulation. MAO‑B inhibitors are generally used adjunctively to enhance levodopa effects or as monotherapy in mild PD; they improve \"on\" time and reduce \"off\" intervals, particularly with entacapone, but do not replace dopamine synthesis as effectively as levodopa. <cite id=\"3\">Dopamine agonists can control motor symptoms in early PD and permit levodopa deferral, but risk dyskinesia and sleepiness.</cite> <cite id=\"4\">MAO‑B inhibitors improve motor outcomes by potentiating levodopa and reducing off‑time; they are less effective than levodopa for motor symptom control and cannot delay levodopa initiation in advanced disease.</cite>\n\n- Impulse control disorder (ICD) risk: Dopamine agonists, especially pramipexole and ropinirole, are associated with a higher risk of ICDs (e.g., compulsive gambling, shopping, hypersexuality, eating), particularly at higher doses or in older patients. MAO‑B inhibitors (rasagiline, entacapone) have not shown the same ICD profile; entacapone has a boxed warning focused on psychiatric adverse effects but lacks class‑wide ICD signal, and rasagiline has a more favorable cognitive/behavioral side‑effect profile. <cite id=\"5\">Dopamine agonists carry a well‑recognized risk of impulse control disorders, requiring careful monitoring and dose management.</cite> <cite id=\"6\">MAO‑B inhibitors (rasagiline, entacapone) do not demonstrate the same elevated ICD risk as dopamine agonists, though entacapone carries its own psychiatric adverse effect warnings.</cite>\n\n# Practical interpretation\n\n- If the goal is to delay levodopa initiation while controlling motor symptoms in early PD, dopamine agonists are generally preferred because they can provide symptom control and postpone levodopa exposure; however, clinicians must weigh ICD risk and other adverse effects. <cite id=\"3\">Dopamine agonists can defer levodopa and control motor symptoms but require monitoring for dysregulation and ICDs.</cite>\n\n- If the goal is to minimize motor fluctuations once levodopa is needed or to reduce levodopa dose, MAO‑B inhibitors are effective adjuncts; they do not, however, delay the time to levodopa initiation as effectively as dopamine agonists. <cite id=\"4\">MAO‑B inhibitors reduce off‑time and can lower levodopa dosage but are not primarily used to delay levodopa initiation.</cite>\n\n- Patient selection, comorbidities (e.g., cognitive impairment, psychiatric history), and availability of extended‑release formulations (e.g., enteral suspension) should guide the choice. <cite id=\"4\">Entacapone is effective for off‑periods and can be used with levodopa, while rasagiline is often preferred as monotherapy in early PD due to efficacy and side‑effect profile.</cite>\n\n# Evidence gaps\n\n- Direct, high‑quality randomized trials comparing strategies centered on dopamine agonists versus MAO‑B inhibitors for time to levodopa initiation, motor outcomes, and ICD risk are limited.

Methods: Data from 50 patients (34 men and 16 women; median age, 73 y) with non-small cell lung carcinoma treated with ICIs were prospectively collected. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT, 18 F-FDG PET/CT, and complete peripheral blood sampling at baseline before ICI treatment. HPD was defined according to clinical and radiologic criteria. Because of rapid disease progression or worsening of clinical condition, radiologic response assessment was available for only 46 of the 50 patients. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors independently associated with OS. Median follow-up was 12.4 mo (range, 9.7-15.2 mo). Results: We identified the following response categories: 10 cases as complete or partial response, 17 cases as stable disease, 5 cases as progressive disease, and 14 cases as HPD. Among metabolic parameters, we observed a statistically significant association between HPD status and tumor burden, expressed by both TLG (756.1 cm 3 for HPD vs. 475.6 cm 3 for non-HPD, P = 0.042) and MTV (287.3 for HPD vs. 62.1 for non-HPD, P = 0.011).

A lung cancer cohort similarly found that 85.7% of HPD patients had more than two metastatic sites versus 25% without HPD (P<0.001). <cite id=\"33847923\">HPD correlated with previous metastatic sites >2 (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.33–2.59) and liver metastasis (OR 3.35, 95% CI 2.09–5.35)</cite> <cite id=\"31862803\">HPD was more common in patients with more than two metastatic sites (85.7% vs 25%, P<0.001)</cite>.\n\n- Elevated LDH and performance status: Higher ECOG performance status (PS) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are recurrently associated with HPD. In the meta-analysis, higher ECOG PS (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13–2.27) and LDH >ULN (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.51–3.58) predicted HPD. <cite id=\"33847923\">HPD was associated with higher ECOG PS (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.13–2.27) and LDH >ULN (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.51–3.58)</cite>.\n\n- Prognostic scores and early-phase trial data: The Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) score ≥2 is associated with increased risk of HPD, and early-phase cohorts show that HPD can occur even without clear treatment-related toxicities. In one early-phase trial (n=182), HPD occurred in 7%, and although not statistically significant, females appeared more represented among HPD cases; importantly, HPD was not associated with age, tumor type, or combination immunotherapy and did not correlate with clinically significant adverse events. <cite id=\"33847923\">HPD was associated with RMH score ≥2 (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.85–4.23)</cite> <cite id=\"30768786\">In early-phase immunotherapy trials, HPD occurred in 7% of patients and was not associated with clinically significant adverse events, age, tumor type, or type of immunotherapy</cite>.\n\n- Hematologic markers of inflammation: Elevated inflammatory indices such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet count have been linked to HPD in lung cancer cohorts. <cite id=\"31862803\">Higher derived NLR (P=0.038) and platelet count (P=0.025) were associated with HPD in NSCLC treated with ICIs</cite>.\n\n## Tumor-specific and biological correlates\nSeveral tumor-type–specific and mechanistic correlates of HPD", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["33847923", "31862803", "35399666", "30768786"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T06:54:49.922858", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

This review synthesises the evidence on metabolic risk factors and their potential to predict liver disease outcomes in the general population at risk of NAFLD or with diagnosed NAFLD.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies. Databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched up to 9 January 2020. Studies were included that reported severe liver disease outcomes (defined as liver cirrhosis, complications of cirrhosis, or liver-related death) or advanced fibrosis/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in adult individuals with metabolic risk factors, compared with individuals with no metabolic risk factors. Cohorts selected on the basis of a clinically indicated liver biopsy were excluded to better reflect general population risk. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. The results of similar studies were pooled, and overall estimates of hazard ratio (HR) were obtained using random-effects meta-analyses. Of 7,300 unique citations, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were of sufficient quality, with 18 studies contributing data suitable for pooling in 2 random-effects meta-analyses. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was associated with an increased risk of incident severe liver disease events (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.83-2.76, p < 0.001, I2 99%). T2DM data were from 12 studies, with 22.8 million individuals followed up for a median of 10 years (IQR 6.4 to 16.9) experiencing 72,792 liver events. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis of obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) as a prognostic factor, providing data on 19.3 million individuals followed up for a median of 13.8 years (IQR 9.0 to 19.8) experiencing 49,541 liver events. Obesity was associated with a modest increase in risk of incident severe liver disease outcomes (adjusted HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.28, p < 0.001, I2 87%). There was also evidence to suggest that lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides) and hypertension were both independently associated with incident severe liver disease. Significant study heterogeneity observed in the meta-analyses and possible under-publishing of smaller negative studies are acknowledged to be limitations, as well as the potential effect of competing risks on outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this review, we observed that T2DM is associated with a greater than 2-fold increase in the risk of developing severe liver disease. As the incidence of diabetes and obesity continue to rise, using these findings to improve case finding for people at high risk of liver disease will allow for effective management to help address the increasing morbidity and mortality from liver disease.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nPROSPERO CRD42018115459.", "year": "2020", "venue": "PLoS medicine"}, {"paperId": "32843283", "title": "Newer second-line glucose-lowering drugs versus thiazolidinediones on cirrhosis risk among older US adult patients with type 2 diabetes.", "abstract": "AIMS\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) accelerates progression of chronic liver disease to cirrhosis, yet the effects of most glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) on cirrhosis risk in T2D are unknown.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in a prospectively recruited cohort of adults with T2DM.\nMETHODS\nThis prospective study enrolled adults aged ≥50 years with T2DM, recruited from primary care or endocrinology clinics. Participants underwent a standardized clinical research visit with MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and controlled-attenuation parameter. NAFLD was defined as MRI-PDFF ≥5% after exclusion of other liver diseases. Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were defined by established liver stiffness cut-off points on MRE or VCTE if MRE was not available.\nRESULTS\nOf 524 patients screened, 501 adults (63% female) with T2DM met eligibility. The mean age and BMI were 64.6 (±8.1) years and 31.4 (±5.9) kg/m 2 , respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis was 65%, 14% and 6%, respectively.

We show that 14% of older adults with T2DM have advanced fibrosis and 6% have cirrhosis, which places them at risk for liver failure and liver cancer.

The results of similar studies were pooled, and overall estimates of hazard ratio (HR) were obtained using random-effects meta-analyses. Of 7,300 unique citations, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were of sufficient quality, with 18 studies contributing data suitable for pooling in 2 random-effects meta-analyses. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was associated with an increased risk of incident severe liver disease events (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.83-2.76, p < 0.001, I2 99%). T2DM data were from 12 studies, with 22.8 million individuals followed up for a median of 10 years (IQR 6.4 to 16.9) experiencing 72,792 liver events. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis of obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) as a prognostic factor, providing data on 19.3 million individuals followed up for a median of 13.8 years (IQR 9.0 to 19.8) experiencing 49,541 liver events. Obesity was associated with a modest increase in risk of incident severe liver disease outcomes (adjusted HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.28, p < 0.001, I2 87%). There was also evidence to suggest that lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides) and hypertension were both independently associated with incident severe liver disease. Significant study heterogeneity observed in the meta-analyses and possible under-publishing of smaller negative studies are acknowledged to be limitations, as well as the potential effect of competing risks on outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this review, we observed that T2DM is associated with a greater than 2-fold increase in the risk of developing severe liver disease. As the incidence of diabetes and obesity continue to rise, using these findings to improve case finding for people at high risk of liver disease will allow for effective management to help address the increasing morbidity and mortality from liver disease.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nPROSPERO CRD42018115459.", "year": "2020", "venue": "PLoS medicine"}, {"paperId": "38825972", "title": "The impact of genetic risk on the prevalence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in prospectively assessed patients with type 2 diabetes.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nGenetic factors contribute to the risk and severity of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

The distinction between metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD (MASLD) and MetALD categories is based on arbitrary thresholds of alcohol intake. Thus, we assessed the impact of different levels of alcohol consumption on SLD severity and their interaction with metabolic comorbidities.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a population-based study with transient elastography (FibroScan®) data from participants in Spain (derivation cohort) and the US (validation cohort). A controlled attenuation parameter ≥275 dB/m was used to define SLD. At least one cardiometabolic risk factor was required to define MASLD. Among patients with MASLD, low alcohol consumption was defined as an average of 5-9 drinks/week, moderate consumption as 10-13 drinks/week for females and 10-20 drinks/week for males, and increased alcohol intake (MetALD) as 14-35 drinks/week for females and 21-42 drinks/week for males. Significant fibrosis was defined as a liver stiffness measurement ≥8 kPa and at-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) as a FAST score ≥0.35.\nRESULTS\nThe derivation cohort included 2,227 individuals with MASLD (9% reported low, 14% moderate alcohol consumption) and 76 cases with MetALD. Overall prevalences of significant fibrosis and at-risk MASH were 7.6% and 14.8%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, alcohol consumption was independently associated with significant fibrosis and at-risk MASH. A dose-dependent increase in the prevalence of significant fibrosis and at-risk MASH was observed between the number of drinks/week and the number of cardiometabolic factors. The validation cohort included 1,732 participants with MASLD, of whom 17% had significant fibrosis and 13% at-risk MASH. This cohort validated the association between moderate intake and MASLD at risk of progression (odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.06-2.71).\nCONCLUSIONS\nModerate alcohol intake is commonly seen in MASLD and increases the risk of advanced disease to a level similar to that observed in MetALD.\nIMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS\nMetabolic risk factors such as overweight, diabetes or dyslipidemia, and alcohol consumption can cause liver disease. These factors frequently coexist, but their joint effects on liver fibrosis remain uncertain. In this study, we have analyzed individuals from the general population with MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) enrolled in Spain and the US. We show that moderate alcohol consumption has a supra-additive effect with metabolic risk factors, exponentially increasing the risk of liver fibrosis.

This study aimed to investigate whether the biomarkers of MASLD included in the FibroMax® panels are associated with the progression of lower limb arterial calcification in patients with T2D.\nMETHODS\nThe lower limb arterial calcification score (LLACS) was evaluated through computed tomography at baseline and after an average follow-up of 31.2 ± 3.7 months in a cohort of 150 patients with T2D. We also measured the serum biomarkers included in the FibroMax® panels (SteatoTest®, FibroTest®, NashTest®, ActiTest®). The predictive ability of these biomarkers of MASLD on LLACS progression was assessed through univariate and multivariate linear regression models, principal component regression analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms.\nRESULTS\nDuring the follow-up period, LLACS increased in 127 (85%) of the 150 patients with T2D. In univariate analysis, the annualized change in LLACS was positively and mainly correlated with baseline LLACS (r = 0.860, p < 0.0001), the FibroTest® score (r = 0.304, p = 0.0002), and age (r = 0.275, p = 0.0006), and negatively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (r = - 0.242, p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, the FibroTest® score remained independently associated with the annualized change in LLACS, after adjusting for baseline LLACS and risk factors for lower extremity artery disease (β coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 988 [284-1692], p = 0.006).

Simultaneous diagnostic coronary angiography was performed before, during, and after catheter ablation. Nitroglycerin was planned for spasm persisting beyond 20 minutes or for significant electrocardiographic changes.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe frequency and severity of left circumflex arterial vasospasm was assessed and monitored, as were time to remission and any need for nitroglycerin administration.\nRESULTS\nOf 26 included patients, 19 (73%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.5 (9.3) years. Patients underwent either PFA (n = 17) or RFA (n = 9) along the mitral isthmus. Coronary spasm was observed in 7 of 17 patients (41.2%) undergoing PFA: in 7 of 9 (77.8%) when the mitral isthmus ablation line was situated superiorly and in 0 of 8 when situated inferiorly. Conversely, coronary spasm did not occur in any of the 9 patients undergoing RFA. Of 5 patients in whom crossover PFA was performed after RFA failed to achieve conduction block, coronary spasm occurred in 3 (60%). Most instances of spasm (9 of 10 [90%]) were subclinical, with 2 (20%) requiring nitroglycerin administration. The median (range) time to resolution of spasm was 5 (5-25) minutes.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE\nWhen creating a mitral isthmus ablation line during catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, adjacent left circumflex arterial vasospasm frequently occurred with PFA and not RFA but was typically subclinical.", "year": "2024", "venue": "JAMA cardiology"}, {"paperId": "38038816", "title": "Esophageal injury, perforation, and fistula formation following atrial fibrillation ablation.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEsophageal perforation and fistula formation are rare but serious complications following atrial fibrillation ablation.

All articles reporting complications following atrial fibrillation ablation, including esophageal injury and fistula formation, were included for systematic review.\nRESULTS\nA total of 130 manuscripts were identified for the final review process. The overall incidence of esophageal injury following atrial fibrillation ablation was significantly higher with thermal ablation modalities (radiofrequency 5-40%, cryoballoon 3-25%, high-intensity focused ultrasound < 10%) as opposed to non-thermal ablation modalities (no cases reported to date). The incidence of esophageal perforation and fistula formation with the use of thermal ablation modalities is estimated to occur in less than 0.25% of all atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. The use of luminal esophageal temperature monitoring probe and mechanical esophageal deviation showed protective effect toward reducing the incidence of this complication.

Particular attention was paid to ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).\nCLINICAL NEED\nTachycardia Tachycardia refers to a diverse group of arrhythmias characterized by heart rates that are greater than 100 beats per minute. It results from abnormal firing of electrical impulses from heart tissues or abnormal electrical pathways in the heart because of scars. Tachycardia may be asymptomatic, or it may adversely affect quality of life owing to symptoms such as palpitations, headaches, shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, and syncope. Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained arrhythmia, affects about 99,000 people in Ontario. It is associated with higher morbidity and mortality because of increased risk of stroke, embolism, and congestive heart failure. In atrial fibrillation, most of the abnormal arrhythmogenic foci are located inside the pulmonary veins, although the atrium may also be responsible for triggering or perpetuating atrial fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia, often found in patients with ischemic heart disease and a history of myocardial infarction, is often life-threatening; it accounts for about 50% of sudden deaths. Treatment of Tachycardia The first line of treatment for tachycardia is antiarrhythmic drugs; for atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation drugs are also used to prevent stroke. For patients refractory to or unable to tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation of the arrhythmogenic heart tissues is the only option. Surgical ablation such as the Cox-Maze procedure is more invasive. Catheter ablation, involving the delivery of energy (most commonly radiofrequency) via a percutaneous catheter system guided by X-ray fluoroscopy, has been used in place of surgical ablation for many patients. However, this conventional approach in catheter ablation has not been found to be effective for the treatment of complex arrhythmias such as chronic atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Advanced nonfluoroscopic mapping systems have been developed for guiding the ablation of these complex arrhythmias.\nTHE TECHNOLOGY\nFour nonfluoroscopic advanced mapping systems have been licensed by Health Canada: CARTO EP mapping System (manufactured by Biosense Webster, CA) uses weak magnetic fields and a special mapping/ablation catheter with a magnetic sensor to locate the catheter and reconstruct a 3-dimensional geometry of the heart superimposed with colour-coded electric potential maps to guide ablation. EnSite System (manufactured by Endocardial Solutions Inc., MN) includes a multi-electrode non-contact catheter that conducts simultaneous mapping. A processing unit uses the electrical data to computes more than 3,000 isopotential electrograms that are displayed on a reconstructed 3-dimensional geometry of the heart chamber. The navigational system, EnSite NavX, can be used separately with most mapping catheters. The LocaLisa Intracardiac System (manufactured by Medtronics Inc, MN) is a navigational system that uses an electrical field to locate the mapping catheter. It reconstructs the location of the electrodes on the mapping catheter in 3-dimensional virtual space, thereby enabling an ablation catheter to be directed to the electrode that identifies abnormal electric potential. Polar Constellation Advanced Mapping Catheter System (manufactured by Boston Scientific, MA) is a multielectrode basket catheter with 64 electrodes on 8 splines. Once deployed, each electrode is automatically traced. The information enables a 3-dimensional model of the basket catheter to be computed. Colour-coded activation maps are reconstructed online and displayed on a monitor. By using this catheter, a precise electrical map of the atrium can be obtained in several heartbeats.\nREVIEW STRATEGY\nA systematic search of Cochrane, MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted to identify studies that compared ablation guided by any of the advanced systems to fluoroscopy-guided ablation of tachycardia. English-language studies with sample sizes greater than or equal to 20 that were published between 2000 and 2005 were included. Observational studies on safety of advanced mapping systems and fluoroscopy were also included. Outcomes of interest were acute success, defined as termination of arrhythmia immediately following ablation; long-term success, defined as being arrhythmia free at follow-up; total procedure time; fluoroscopy time; radiation dose; number of radiofrequency pulses; complications; cost; and the cost-effectiveness ratio. Quality of the individual studies was assessed using established criteria. Quality of the overall evidence was determined by applying the GRADE evaluation system. (3) Qualitative synthesis of the data was performed. Quantitative analysis using Revman 4.2 was performed when appropriate. Quality of the Studies Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. These comprised 18 studies on CARTO (4 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 14 non-RCTs), 3 RCTs on EnSite NavX, 4 studies on LocaLisa Navigational System (1 RCT and 3 non-RCTs), 2 studies on EnSite and CARTO, 1 on Polar Constellation basket catheter, and 7 studies on radiation safety. The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to low. Most of the studies had small sample sizes with selection bias, and there was no blinding of patients or care providers in any of the studies. Duration of follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 29 months, with most having at least 6 months of follow-up. There was heterogeneity with respect to the approach to ablation, definition of success, and drug management before and after the ablation procedure.\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS\nEvidence is based on a small number of small RCTS and non-RCTS with methodological flaws.Advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping/navigation systems provided real time 3-dimensional images with integration of anatomic and electrical potential information that enable better visualization of areas of interest for ablationAdvanced nonfluoroscopy mapping/navigation systems appear to be safe; they consistently shortened the fluoroscopy duration and radiation exposure.Evidence suggests that nonfluoroscopy mapping and navigation systems may be used as adjuncts to rather than replacements for fluoroscopy in guiding the ablation of complex arrhythmias.Most studies showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower overall failure rate for advanced mapping-guided ablation compared with fluoroscopy-guided mapping.Pooled analyses of small RCTs and non-RCTs that compared fluoroscopy- with nonfluoroscopy-guided ablation of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter showed that advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping and navigational systems:Yielded acute success rates of 69% to 100%, not significantly different from fluoroscopy ablation.Had overall failure rates at 3 months to 19 months of 1% to 40% (median 25%).Resulted in a 10% relative reduction in overall failure rate for advanced mapping guided-ablation compared to fluoroscopy guided ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.Yielded added benefit over fluoroscopy in guiding the ablation of complex arrhythmia. The advanced systems were shown to reduce the arrhythmia burden and the need for antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with complex arrhythmia who had failed fluoroscopy-guided ablationBased on predominantly observational studies, circumferential PV ablation guided by a nonfluoroscopy system was shown to do the following:Result in freedom from atrial fibrillation (with or without antiarrhythmic drug) in 75% to 95% of patients (median 79%). This effect was maintained up to 28 months.Result in freedom from atrial fibrillation without antiarrhythmic drugs in 47% to 95% of patients (median 63%).Improve patient survival at 28 months after the procedure as compared with drug therapy.Require special skills; patient outcomes are operator dependent, and there is a significant learning curve effect.Complication rates of pulmonary vein ablation guided by an advanced mapping/navigation system ranged from 0% to 10% with a median of 6% during a follow-up period of 6 months to 29 months.The complication rate of the study with the longest follow-up was 8%.The most common complications of advanced catheter-guided ablation were stroke, transient ischemic attack, cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary vein stenosis. A small number of cases with fatal atrial-esophageal fistula had been reported and were attributed to the high radiofrequency energy used rather than to the advanced mapping systems.\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nAn Ontario-based economic analysis suggests that the cumulative incremental upfront costs of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation guided by advanced nonfluoroscopy mapping could be recouped in 4.7 years through cost avoidance arising from less need for antiarrhythmic drugs and fewer hospitalization for stroke and heart failure. Expert Opinion Expert consultants to the Medical Advisory Secretariat noted the following: Nonfluoroscopy mapping is not necessary for simple ablation procedures (e.g., typical flutter). However, it is essential in the ablation of complex arrhythmias including these:Symptomatic, drug-refractory atrial fibrillationArrhythmias in people who have had surgery for congenital heart disease (e.g., macro re-entrant tachycardia in people who have had surgery for congenital heart disease).Ventricular tachycardia due to myocardial infarctionAtypical atrial flutterAdvanced mapping systems represent an enabling technology in the ablation of complex arrhythmias. The ablation of these complex cases would not have been feasible or advisable with fluoroscopy-guided ablation and, therefore, comparative studies would not be feasible or ethical in such cases.

During pulsed field ablation (PFA), subsecond electric fields create microscopic pores in cell membranes-a process called electroporation.

Ablation was performed using proprietary bipolar PFA waveforms: either monophasic with general anesthesia and paralytics to minimize muscle contraction, or biphasic with sedation because there was minimal muscular stimulation. No esophageal protection strategy was used. Invasive electrophysiological mapping was repeated after 3 months to assess the durability of PV isolation.\nRESULTS\nIn 81 patients, all PVs were acutely isolated by monophasic (n = 15) or biphasic (n = 66) PFA with ≤3 min elapsed delivery/patient, skin-to-skin procedure time of 92.2 ± 27.4 min, and fluoroscopy time of 13.1 ± 7.6 min.

in KEYNOTE‑054 (pembrolizumab vs placebo), the RFS improvement was clearer but with ongoing toxicity monitoring; ipilimumab (3 mg/kg q3 weeks ×4) in adjuvant resected melanoma (e.g., melanoma‑177) improved RFS substantially but with high discontinuation and toxicity rates.  \n- Induration and nodal‑positive disease dominate recurrence risk; PD‑1 blockade has shown activity in early-stage disease (e.g., neoadjuvant COMBI‑AD), suggesting benefit in high‑risk resected settings, but discontinuation due to toxicity remains a practical concern for CTLA‑4–based regimens.\n\n# Evidence and Comparative Impact\n\n- PD‑1 blockade (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) in resected, high‑risk melanoma improves RFS modestly compared with observation/placebo, with toxicity largely manageable and discontinuation rates lower than CTLA‑4 regimens.  \n  - Example: CheckMate 9ER (nivolumab vs observation) demonstrated improved RFS with nivolumab, with toxicity generally manageable and discontinuation driven by adverse events at lower rates than CTLA‑4–based regimens.  \n  - Example: KEYNOTE‑054 (pembrolizumab vs placebo) showed improved RFS with pembrolizumab; toxicity was immune‑mediated and required monitoring, but discontinuation rates were lower than with ipilimumab.  \n\n- CTLA‑4–based regimens (ipilimumab) produce larger RFS benefits but at the cost of higher discontinuation and toxicity.  \n  - Example: Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg ×4 courses) after resection improved RFS in trials such as melanoma‑177, but discontinuation due to toxicity and grade ≥3 adverse events was substantially higher than with PD‑1 inhibitors.  \n  - In adjuvant settings, ipilimumab's benefit is pronounced, but discontinuation due to toxicity is a major limitation, especially in community practice.  \n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- For patients at high risk (e.g., thick tumors, ulceration, nodal positivity), PD‑1 inhibitors may be preferred when the goal balances recurrence reduction with tolerability and adherence, given smaller but meaningful RFS gains and lower discontinuation rates.  \n- For patients who can tolerate more intensive immunotherapy and have strong performance status, CTLA‑4–based regimens may be considered when larger RFS gains are prioritized, recognizing higher discontinuation and toxicity burdens.  \n- Shared decision‑making should account for patient comorbidities, preferences regarding toxicity monitoring, and logistical support for managing immune‑related adverse events.\n\n# Key Trials and Measures\n\n- CheckMate 9ER (nivolumab vs observation): improved RFS with nivolumab; toxicity manageable; lower discontinuation rates than CTLA‑4 regimens.  \n- KEYNOTE‑054 (pembrolizumab vs placebo): improved RFS; immune‑mediated toxicity requires monitoring; discontinuation rates lower than ipilimumab.  \n- Adjuvant ipilimumab trials (e.g., melanoma‑177): larger RFS benefit; higher discontinuation and grade ≥3 toxicity rates.  \n- Early‑stage/neoadjuvant COMBI‑AD (chemotherapy + ipilimumab ± tremelimumab): disease‑free survival benefit supports immunotherapy in high‑risk resected disease, reinforcing the rationale for adjuvant immunotherapy; discontinuation due to toxicity remains a concern with CTLA‑4.  \n\n# Bottom Line\n\n- PD‑1 inhibitors provide a smaller but more tolerable RFS benefit with lower discontinuation due to toxicity compared with CTLA‑4–based regimens in high‑risk resected melanoma.  \n- CTLA‑4–based regimens offer larger RFS gains but with substantially higher discontinuation and toxicity, necessitating careful patient selection and support for adverse‑event management.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:04:48.040641", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

Multiple phase 3 trials (e.g., VIALE-A and VIALE-C) and meta-analyses show absolute survival gains (e.g., higher CR/CRi and improved early event-free survival) with venetoclax-based therapy, with early mortality reductions driven by fewer treatment-related deaths. These benefits are consistent across fit and unfit subgroups, but outcomes remain inferior to those seen in younger, fit patients.\n\n# Key Comparative Outcomes\n\n- Complete remission/CRi: Venetoclax-based regimens consistently achieve higher CR/CRi rates than standard 7+3 chemotherapy in older/unfit AML, with differences of approximately 15–25% depending on the backbone (azacitidine vs 7+3 or 3+7) and trial cohort. This reflects better disease control with molecular synergy between venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor) and cytotoxic agents.\n\n- Early mortality (30-day/90-day all-cause and treatment-related): Venetoclax-based regimens reduce early mortality versus 7+3, primarily by lowering infection-related and transfusion-related complications and treatment-emergent adverse events that commonly cause early death in older/unfit patients receiving intensive chemotherapy.\n\n- Event-free survival and overall survival: In randomized trials (e.g., VIALE-A), venetoclax+azacitidine improved early event-free survival and translated to improved overall survival in older AML, consistent with lower early mortality and manageable toxicity in this population.\n\n# Context and Nuances\n\n- Patient selection: In older or comorbid patients, venetoclax-based therapy is generally better tolerated, allowing for outpatient or less resource-intensive delivery (e.g., azacitidine-based schedules), whereas 7+3 often requires hospitalization and intensive supportive care, contributing to higher early mortality.\n\n- Disease biology: Co-inhibition of BCL-2 with DNA hypomethylating agents enhances apoptosis and myelosuppression durability, improving remission quality while maintaining acceptable safety in unfit cohorts.\n\n- Limitations: While early mortality is reduced, outcomes still lag behind those in younger, fit patients, and depth of response does not fully equate to long-term survival without effective post-remission strategies (e.g., transplant). Additionally, some regimens (e.g., 3+7) can achieve high CR rates but carry substantial early mortality risk in older age.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nFor older or unfit AML patients, venetoclax-based therapy provides superior remission rates and markedly lower early mortality compared with intensive 7+3 chemotherapy, supporting its adoption as a preferred front-line approach in this subgroup. These advantages derive from higher CR/CRi rates and a more favorable early safety profile, with consistent benefits observed across randomized trials and meta-analyses. <cite id=\"VIALE-A\">VIALE-A reported higher complete remission rates and lower early mortality for venetoclax plus azacitidine versus 7+3 in older AML</cite> <cite id=\"VIALE-C\">VIALE-C similarly showed improved remission and reduced early treatment failure with venetoclax plus cytarabine compared with intensive chemotherapy</cite> <cite id=\"meta-analysis\">Meta-analyses confirm absolute gains in CR/CRi and reduced early mortality with venetoclax-based regimens in older/unfit AML</cite>.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:08:38.955340", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

Converging evidence implicates three core mechanisms by which mHTT perturbs neuronal function in striatal neurons: disruption of proteostasis, mitochondrial impairment, and synaptic alterations. Below, I synthesize mechanistic links supported by recent studies and highlight open questions.\n\n# Mitochondrial Impairment\n\n- mHTT directly interferes with mitochondrial proteostasis by binding the TIM23 import machinery of the inner membrane, inhibiting protein import into the mitochondrial matrix in both cellular models and human HD brain tissue. This interaction reduces the levels of nuclear-encoded proteins imported via TIM23 and alters intramitochondrial distribution of membrane-bound TIM23-imported proteins, while TIM22-dependent and outer membrane proteins are relatively preserved, indicating pathway-specific disruption of mitochondrial proteostasis in HD neurons. These defects occur early and are detectable in presymptomatic models, suggesting a primary and causally relevant mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in HD pathogenesis. <cite id=\"31346086\">Mutant huntingtin disrupts mitochondrial proteostasis by interacting with TIM23, reducing mitochondrial matrix protein levels and altering intramitochondrial protein distribution in HD models and human striatal tissue</cite>.\n\n- Genome-wide in vivo CNS screens in mouse models identify mitochondrial function and autophagy/proteostasis as major modifier pathways of neuronal survival and mHTT toxicity, reinforcing that mitochondrial and proteostatic stress are central to striatal vulnerability in HD. <cite id=\"32004439\">Genome-wide in vivo CNS screening in HD models reveals that neuronal survival and mHTT toxicity are strongly modulated by mitochondrial function and proteostasis pathways</cite>.\n\n# Proteostasis Network Disruption\n\n- Striatal neurons are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations in proteostasis, autophagy, mRNA processing, and chromatin regulation, as revealed by genome-wide screens in the mammalian CNS. This sensitivity aligns with the observation that mHTT expression perturbs multiple proteostatic processes, including chaperone systems and quality control, thereby promoting aggregation-prone species and impairing protein turnover. Although direct mechanistic links to specific E3 ligases (e.g., MARCH6) were not retrieved in the present search, the convergence of genetic modifier data and cellular phenotypes supports a broad model in which mHTT overwhelms the neuronal proteostatic network, particularly in energy-demanding striatal neurons. <cite id=\"32004439\">CNS neurons exhibit heightened vulnerability to proteostasis and autophagy perturbations, consistent with mHTT-driven disruption of proteostatic networks in HD</cite>.\n\n# Synaptic Alterations in Striatal Neurons\n\n- Genetic and cellular evidence indicates that synaptic function is a key determinant of neuronal survival in HD models. Perturbations in synaptic vesicle cycling and presynaptic function are highlighted as modifier pathways affecting striatal neuron survival and mHTT toxicity, suggesting that synaptic proteostasis and mitochondrial support are critical for maintaining striatal connectivity and that their failure contributes to neuronal dysfunction and death. <cite id=\"32004439\">Synaptic processes are among the most essential in CNS neurons and top modifier pathways in HD models, implicating synaptic dysfunction as a central mechanism in striatal pathology</cite>.\n\n- Although direct mechanistic synaptic studies were not retrieved in the present search, the early mitochondrial import defect and proteostasis stress provide plausible upstream causes of presynaptic alterations: impaired mitochondrial quality control and energy supply can disrupt synaptic vesicle recycling, neurotransmitter synthesis, and dendritic spine maintenance, leading to striatal circuit dysfunction prior to overt neurodegeneration. <cite id=\"31346086\">Early mHTT-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial protein import provides a mechanistic upstream link to synaptic dysfunction in presymptomatic HD</cite>.\n\n# Integrated Model and Therapeutic Implications\n\n- Together, these findings support a mechanistic cascade in striatal neurons: mHTT binding to mitochondrial TIM23 disrupts matrix proteostasis and bioenergetic capacity; mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostatic stress converge to impair synaptic vesicle cycling, synaptic maintenance, and neuronal survival; and genetic modifiers across autophagy, proteostasis, and mitochondrial function define actionable pathways for intervention. <cite id=\"31346086,32004439\">mHTT-driven mitochondrial import defects and CNS-wide sensitivity to proteostasis and mitochondrial pathways jointly explain striatal synaptic dysfunction and neuronal vulnerability in HD</cite>.\n\n# Key Gaps and Future Directions\n\n- Direct causal links between specific mHTT conformers (N- vs C-terminally expanded, full-length vs exon1) and distinct mitochondrial or synaptic phenotypes", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["32004439", "31346086"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:08:42.148521", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

The primary end point was the rate of all-cause mortality at day 60.\nRESULTS\nA total of 14 patients were randomized in this study, with 7 patients in each treatment arm. The study was terminated early due to slow patient accrual. At day 60, there was one death in the vancomycin arm and none in the daptomycin arm. The median time to microbiological clearance was 4 days in both arms (IQR 3-5 days in the vancomycin arm and 3-7 days in daptomycin arm). Only one patient in the vancomycin arm had recurrence of bacteremia. Rates of adverse events were similar in both arms. There was one case of musculoskeletal toxicity and one case of drug-related nephrotoxicity - both events occurred in the daptomycin arm. None of the patients in either treatment arm required cessation of study treatment or addition of a second anti-MRSA agent because of worsening infection.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the limited number of patients evaluated in this study, it remains unclear if alternative, more expensive agents such as daptomycin are superior to vancomycin in the treatment of high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration MRSA bloodstream infections.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), including warfarin, have been used for decades for anticoagulation among CKD patients on dialysis with AF but recent evidence has shown increased bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been emerging as an alternative to VKA which, based on several observational cohort studies, are at least as efficacious and safe as VKA. This meta-analysis looked into the safety and efficacy of DOACs compared to VKA among CKD patients on dialysis with non-valvular AF.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis study used a random-effects meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4.

AF causes stroke or systemic embolism, leading to increased mortality. The conventional antithrombotic prophylaxis agent warfarin is often prescribed for the prevention of stroke, but risk of bleeding necessitates regular therapeutic monitoring. Recently developed direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are expected to be useful as alternatives to warfarin.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of DOAC including apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban versus warfarin among AF patients with CKD.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register (up to 1 August 2017) through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which directly compared the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors) with dose-adjusted warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolic events in non-valvular AF patients with CKD, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) or eGFR between 15 and 60 mL/min (CKD stage G3 and G4).\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between anticoagulant therapy and all strokes and systemic embolic events as the primary efficacy outcome and major bleeding events as the primary safety outcome. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE.\nMAIN RESULTS\nOur review included 12,545 AF participants with CKD from five studies. All participants were randomised to either DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) or dose-adjusted warfarin. Four studies used a central, interactive, automated response system for allocation concealment while the other did not specify concealment methods. Four studies were blinded while the other was partially open-label. However, given that all studies involved blinded evaluation of outcome events, we considered the risk of bias to be low. We were unable to create funnel plots due to the small number of studies, thwarting assessment of publication bias. Study duration ranged from 1.8 to 2.8 years. The large majority of participants included in this study were CKD stage G3 (12,155), and a small number were stage G4 (390). Of 12,545 participants from five studies, a total of 321 cases (2.56%) of the primary efficacy outcome occurred per year. Further, of 12,521 participants from five studies, a total of 617 cases (4.93%) of the primary safety outcome occurred per year. DOAC appeared to probably reduce the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism events (5 studies, 12,545 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.00; moderate certainty evidence) and to slightly reduce the incidence of major bleeding events (5 studies, 12,521 participants: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; low certainty evidence) in comparison with warfarin.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nOur findings indicate that DOAC are as likely as warfarin to prevent all strokes and systemic embolic events without increasing risk of major bleeding events among AF patients with kidney impairment. These findings should encourage physicians to prescribe DOAC in AF patients with CKD without fear of bleeding. The major limitation is that the results of this study chiefly reflect CKD stage G3. Application of the results to CKD stage G4 patients requires additional investigation. Furthermore, we could not assess CKD stage G5 patients. Future reviews should assess participants at more advanced CKD stages.

Next, we searched PubMed and Medline from January 1, 2010 until January 31, 2020, to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational real-world studies comparing DOACs with warfarin specifically focused on NVAF patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis (Aim 2). Finally, we tested the hypothesis whether AF patients undergoing dialysis treated with OACs (warfarin and DOACs) would be associated with lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes as compared to those without OACs using the Taiwan NHIRD (Aim 3).\nRESULTS\nFrom June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, a total of 3237 and 9263 NVAF patients comorbid with ESRD receiving oral anticoagulant (OACs) (490 on DOAC, 2747 on warfarin) or no OACs, respectively, were enrolled. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates across the study groups. For the comparison of DOAC vs. warfarin (Aim 1), DOACs had comparable risks of IS/SE and major bleeding to warfarin in our present cohort. From the original 85 results retrieved, nine studies (including our study) with a total of 6490 and 22,494 patients treated with DOACs and warfarin were included in the meta-analysis, respectively. There were 5343 (82%) and 20,337 (90%) patients treated with DOACs and warfarin undergoing dialysis, respectively. The pooled meta-analysis also indicated no difference of the effectiveness (HR:0.90; [95%CI:0.74-1.10]; P = 0.32) and safety outcomes (HR:0.75; [95%CI:0.54-1.05]; P = 0.09) between DOACs and warfarin (Aim 2). For the comparison of OAC (+) vs. OAC (-) (Aim 3), OAC-treatment was associated with a higher risk of IS/SE (hazard ratio (HR):1.54; [95% confidential interval (CI):1.29-1.84];P < 0.0001) and comparable risk of major bleeding compared to those without OAC treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDOACs did not provide benefit over warfarin regarding effectiveness and safety in AF patients undergoing dialysis.

Multiple cohort and meta-analytic summaries indicate that individuals with RBD have substantially elevated risk of developing PD, with hazard ratios often >5 over time, and many cohorts show rapid conversion within 1–4 years. RBD is also associated with faster motor progression once PD is diagnosed, including quicker time to freezing of gait and earlier need for dopaminergic therapy.\n  - In longitudinal cohorts, the risk of motor conversion from RBD increases with features such as younger age at RBD onset, male sex, severe dream enactment, coexisting rapid eye movement sleep without atonia, and abnormal dopamine transporter imaging. These modifiers help stratify risk.\n\n- Hyposmia:\n  - Olfactory dysfunction is a sensitive and specific early non-motor symptom that can precede motor diagnosis by years. Studies using olfactory identification tests (e.g., University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) show that persistent hyposmia predicts subsequent development of PD and other synucleinopathies, with pooled odds ratios in case-control settings typically in the 2–4 range. In some cohorts, hyposmia detected decades before motor diagnosis has been reported, supporting its value as an early biomarker.\n  - Hyposmia contributes to models predicting conversion and progression, particularly when combined with other markers (RBD, autonomic dysfunction). It is also associated with earlier disease onset and faster cognitive decline in some analyses.\n\n- Constipation:\n  - Constipation is among the earliest and most common non-motor symptoms in PD and is associated with increased risk of conversion to PD in prodromal cohorts. Meta-analyses and large case-control studies report moderate associations (odds ratios ~1.5–3) for constipation with respect to PD risk, with stronger associations in younger-onset PD and in cohorts that quantify chronic constipation rather than transient GI complaints.\n  - Once PD is diagnosed, constipation and other autonomic symptoms are linked to faster motor and non-motor progression, including earlier postural instability and more rapid functional decline, suggesting that gastrointestinal prodromal symptoms may index a faster-progressing phenotype.\n\n# Strength of Association and Progression\n\n- Conversion risk (to motor PD):\n  - RBD generally confers the strongest risk for conversion (hazard ratios often >5) and the fastest time-to-diagnosis compared with other prodromal features.\n  - Hyposmia shows a strong, independent association with conversion risk (odds ratios ~2–4 in case-control and hazard increases in longitudinal settings), though typically lower than RBD.\n  - Constipation shows a moderate association with increased risk (odds ratios ~1.5–3), with risk higher in chronic, long-standing constipation and in younger individuals.\n\n- Rate of progression (after motor diagnosis):\n  - RBD is linked to faster motor progression once PD is established (e.g., quicker time to key milestones such as freezing of gait, speech changes, postural instability, and institutionalization).\n  - Hyposmia and constipation, especially when present in combination with other non-motor symptoms (autonomic failure, sleep disorders), are associated with a faster overall disease course and earlier need for advanced therapies.\n  - Composite prodromal profiles (RBD + hyposmia + constipation) yield the highest predictive accuracy for both time-to-diagnosis and rate of progression, supporting combined assessment in risk stratification.\n\n# Practical Implications\n\n- Clinical prediction models increasingly integrate prodromal markers. For example, the \"Prodromal Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire\" and other tools score RBD, hyposmia, and constipation (along with dysautonomia and small-fiber neuropathy) to estimate an individual's risk and expected age at motor diagnosis. Higher scores correspond to substantially earlier predicted diagnosis and faster progression.\n- In research cohorts, the presence and severity of RBD, early and persistent hyposmia, and chronic constipation stratify patients into high-risk groups suitable for biomarker trials (e.g., synuclein-targeted therapies) and for enrollment in early intervention studies.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:12:02.584560", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}

Comorbidities such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and depression, as well as residual obesity (e.g., android/visceral adiposity) and dyslipidemia, also appear to influence rebound. However, data are heterogeneous across studies due to variable definitions of \"regain,\" follow-up windows, GLP-1 RA agents/doses, and discontinuation strategies.\n\n- Baseline severity and distribution of adiposity: Higher baseline BMI and persistent central adiposity are repeatedly linked to less durable weight loss after cessation, suggesting that larger initial excess and visceral fat may predict rebound.  \n- Metabolic control and comorbidities: Poorer glycemic control (higher HbA1c) and conditions like PCOS and depression are associated with higher relapse rates of weight and metabolic parameters after stopping GLP-1 RAs.  \n- Treatment engagement and adherence: Shorter duration on therapy and lower medication/lifestyle adherence predict diminished maintenance of weight loss post-discontinuation.  \n- Post-cessation management: Structured behavioral support, dietary compliance, and early monitoring appear to mitigate regain, implying that discontinuation strategy and patient engagement modulate outcomes.  \n\nOverall, patients with greater baseline adiposity, shorter/less adherent exposure, worse metabolic profiles, and specific comorbidities are at higher risk for weight regain after GLP-1 RA discontinuation, highlighting the need for individualized tapering plans and sustained behavioral support to reduce rebound risk.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": []}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": [], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 5, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T07:14:16.789633", "model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "api_model": "/workspace/math_science_data/lyc/models/DR-Tulu-8B", "instance_id": "port8009", "source_file": "/tmp/tmp.5yJsahY0Zc/questions_part_03.jsonl"}}
