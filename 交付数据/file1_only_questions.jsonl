However, in patients on this combination of drugs, there is no conclusive evidence of an increase in adverse cardiovascular events. From pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic perspectives, there is a real interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs because of the competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 isoenzyme which is required for biotransformation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. The consequent decrease in the availability of this active metabolite leads to attenuation of antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel. In several observational trials, it was shown that decreased antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel due to PPIs may translate into poor cardiovascular outcomes. However, an incomplete RCT (COGENT) and a post hoc analysis of two large trials (PRINCIPLE-TIMI 44 and TRITON-TIMI 38 trial) showed no significant adverse cardiovascular events with this combination. Caution is however needed in patients who are hypometabolizers of clopidogrel putting them at a higher risk of adverse coronary events. Since 3% of patients are likely to be hypometabolizers of clopidogrel, routine combination of clopidogrel and PPIs should be avoided. There is a heightened awareness of this interaction following multiple advisory warnings. At the same time, one should not withhold PPIs in patients who are at a high risk of developing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. In these patients, selected choices of PPI such as pantoprazole may be helpful and for low risk patients, serious consideration should be given to H(2) receptor antagonists or antacids. Therefore, while not compromising the cardioprotective effect of antiplatelet agents, the gastroprotective benefit of PPI should be strongly considered in patients who need both. Health care providers should remain alert to more outcome data. Future researchers will need to demonstrate the safety of coadministration of PPIs and clopidogrel and trials should be powered to detect major adverse cardiovascular events and facilitate risk stratification based on genetic polymorphism.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"21544314\">Title: Proton pump inhibitors, genetic polymorphisms and response to clopidogrel therapy.\nAuthors: Fernando, H, Dart, A M, Peter, K et al. | Year: 2011 | Journal: Thrombosis and haemostasis\nAbstract: Clopidogrel has become part of the mainstay of therapy for acute coronary syndromes and in patients post stenting. Clopidogrel is a pro drug and is metabolised by liver enzymes, particularly CYP2C19, into its active form. A considerable proportion of patients have a poor response to clopidogrel and this may be due to several factors. Genetic polymorphisms involved in clopidogrel's absorption, metabolism and activity at the platelet may interfere with its antiplatelet actions. Further, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may interfere with clopidogrel's actions by functionally reducing the ability of CYP2C19 to convert clopidogrel to its active metabolite. By attenuating clopidogrel's actions, both polymorphisms and drug interactions may increase the risk of thrombotic events during clopidogrel therapy. This review will explore the current evidence relating to the association between PPIs, genetic polymorphisms and poor response to clopidogrel. Routine genetic testing cannot be recommended for patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). However, it may have a role for patients with an episode of stent thrombosis, prior to planned high-risk stenting or major bleeding. Regarding concomitant clopidogrel and PPI therapy, it is recommended that only patients with previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or multiple risk factors for GI bleeding should be prescribed gastroprotection. This is due to the uncertainty surrounding the clinical significance of this interaction given the discordant biochemical and clinical data, conflicting results from observational studies and the limitations of the COGENT study. Pantoprazole seems least likely to interact with clopidogrel and most suitable for use in patients receiving DAPT.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27012778\">Title: Proton-Pump Inhibitors Reduce Gastrointestinal Events Regardless of Aspirin Dose in Patients Requiring Dual Antiplatelet Therapy.\nAuthors: Vaduganathan, Muthiah, Bhatt, Deepak L, Cryer, Byron L et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Journal of the American College of Cardiology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe COGENT (Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial) showed that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) safely reduced rates of gastrointestinal (GI) events in patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). However, utilization of appropriate prophylactic PPI therapy remains suboptimal, especially with low-dose aspirin.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe authors investigated the safety and efficacy of PPI therapy in patients receiving DAPT in low- and high-dose aspirin subsets.\nMETHODS\nRandomized patients with available aspirin dosing information in COGENT (N = 3,752) were divided into \"low-dose\" (≤ 100 mg) and \"high-dose\" (>100 mg) aspirin groups. The primary GI and cardiovascular endpoints were composite upper GI events and major adverse cardiac events, respectively. All events were adjudicated by independent, blinded gastroenterologists and cardiologists.\nRESULTS\nMedian duration of follow-up was 110 days. Low-dose aspirin users (n = 2,480; 66.1%) were more likely to be older, female, and have higher rates of peripheral artery disease, prior stroke, and hypertension, whereas high-dose aspirin users (n = 1,272; 33.9%) had higher rates of hyperlipidemia, smoking, a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, and were more than twice as likely to be enrolled from sites within the United States (80.4% vs. 39.8%). High-dose aspirin was associated with similar 180-day Kaplan-Meier estimates of adjudicated composite GI events (1.7% vs. 2.1%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 1.66) and major adverse cardiac events (4.8% vs. 5.5%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 1.11) compared with low-dose aspirin. Randomization to PPI therapy reduced 180-day Kaplan-Meier estimates of the primary GI endpoint in low-dose (1.2% vs. 3.1%) and high-dose aspirin subsets (0.9% vs. 2.6%; p for interaction = 0.80), and did not adversely affect the primary cardiovascular endpoint in either group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGastroprotection with PPI therapy should be utilized in appropriately selected patients with coronary artery disease requiring DAPT, even if the patients are on low-dose aspirin.

Data are limited regarding the efficacy and safety of PPIs in high-risk cardiovascular subsets after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention.\nMETHODS\nAll patients enrolled in COGENT (Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial) were initiated on DAPT (with aspirin and clopidogrel) for various indications within the prior 21 days. These post hoc analyses of the COGENT trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of omeprazole compared with placebo in subsets of patients requiring DAPT for the 2 most frequent indications: 1) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (for any indication) within 14 days of randomization (n = 2676; 71.2%); and 2) patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome managed with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 1573; 41.8%). Unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate effect sizes through final follow-up.\nRESULTS\nMedian follow-up duration was 110 days (interquartile range 55-167). In percutaneous coronary intervention-treated patients, omeprazole significantly reduced rates of composite gastrointestinal events at 180 days (1.2% vs 2.7%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.85; P = .02) without increasing composite cardiovascular events (5.4% vs 6.3%; HR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.67-1.50; P = 1.00). Similarly, omeprazole lowered risk of the primary gastrointestinal endpoint at 180 days in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (1.1% vs 2.7%; HR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.13-1.01; P = .05) without a significant excess in cardiovascular events (5.6% vs 4.5%; HR 1.40; 95% CI, 0.77-2.53; P = .27).\nCONCLUSIONS\nPPI therapy attenuates gastrointestinal bleeding risk without significant excess in major cardiovascular events in high-risk cardiovascular subsets, regardless of indication for DAPT.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are believed to decrease the risk of such complications, though no randomized trial has proved this in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Recently, concerns have been raised about the potential for PPIs to blunt the efficacy of clopidogrel.\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned patients with an indication for dual antiplatelet therapy to receive clopidogrel in combination with either omeprazole or placebo, in addition to aspirin. The primary gastrointestinal end point was a composite of overt or occult bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction, or perforation. The primary cardiovascular end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, or stroke. The trial was terminated prematurely when the sponsor lost financing.\nRESULTS\nWe planned to enroll about 5000 patients; a total of 3873 were randomly assigned and 3761 were included in analyses. In all, 51 patients had a gastrointestinal event; the event rate was 1.1% with omeprazole and 2.9% with placebo at 180 days (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.63; P<0.001). The rate of overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding was also reduced with omeprazole as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.56; P = 0.001). A total of 109 patients had a cardiovascular event, with event rates of 4.9% with omeprazole and 5.7% with placebo (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.44; P = 0.96); high-risk subgroups did not show significant heterogeneity. The two groups did not differ significantly in the rate of serious adverse events, though the risk of diarrhea was increased with omeprazole.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel, prophylactic use of a PPI reduced the rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no apparent cardiovascular interaction between clopidogrel and omeprazole, but our results do not rule out a clinically meaningful difference in cardiovascular events due to use of a PPI.

An epidemiologic framework is applied to assess clinical relevance and reinforce best practice recommendations.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nThe evidence for PPI adverse events is limited by the absence of Level 1 (randomized controlled trial) studies. The best evidence supports Clostridium difficile and bone fractures in susceptible populations. A substantial reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding risk without increase in cardiovascular events was observed in the COGENT trial when clopidogrel was coprescribed with omeprazole. The risk of pneumonia is inconsistent, and although acute interstitial nephritis, nutritional deficiencies (including B12 and hypomagnesemia), gastric carcinoid and rebound hyperacidity are biologically plausible, studies have failed to demonstrate supportive clinical relevance.\nSUMMARY\nPrescribe PPI for robust indications only. Strong data supporting risk of adverse events are lacking; however, exercise caution in the elderly and in patients with other risk factors for bone fractures or C. difficile infection.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"23196684\">Title: [Proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel: an association to avoid?].\nAuthors: D'Ugo, Emilia, Rossi, Serena, De Caterina, Raffaele | Year: 2012 | Journal: Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)\nAbstract: Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces cardiovascular events following an acute coronary syndrome or stent implantation, but the associated increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding often leads clinicians to the co-administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs have been shown to decrease antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel ex vivo, raising doubts on the safety of this drug combination. Clinical trials investigating PPI-clopidogrel interaction have provided conflicting results and have been often criticized. Moreover, a prospective, double-bind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted with adequate follow-up and sample size has not yet been performed. Indeed, the COGENT trial, which would have had such characteristics, has been stopped prematurely. The question is therefore still unresolved, and clinical effects of PPI-clopidogrel interaction cannot be excluded. As a practical consequence, this combination therapy is recommended only for patients at high risk of bleeding (prior upper gastrointestinal bleeding, advanced age, concomitant use of warfarin, steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Helicobacter pylori infection), avoiding in any case PPIs with greater affinity for CYP2C19, such as omeprazole and esomeprazole.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"22001826\">Title: Prescribing proton pump inhibitor and clopidogrel together: current state of recommendations.\nAuthors: Abraham, Neena S | Year: 2011 | Journal: Current opinion in gastroenterology\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nConflicting evidence has contributed to confusion regarding the safety of co-prescribing a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and clopidogrel. This review will quantify the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with common cardioprophylactic regimens, review the evidence regarding a PPI-clopidogrel interaction and assess its clinical relevance, and reinforce best-practice recommendations for gastrointestinal bleeding prevention among patients prescribed clopidogrel.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nThe COGENT trial confirmed a substantial reduction in gastrointestinal bleeding risk without apparent increase in cardiovascular events when clopidogrel was co-prescribed with omeprazole. These data are consistent with secondary data analyses of large cardiovascular trials and well adjusted observational studies that also failed to confirm a consistent, clinically relevant increase in cardiovascular endpoints or mortality. Individual genetic variations in drug metabolism may contribute to increased cardiac event rates observed in small subsets of the population when PPI is co-prescribed. In the future, pharmacogenomics and point-of-care testing will likely play an emerging role in individualizing prescription strategy.\nSUMMARY\nA pragmatic approach dictates an explicit risk-benefit assessment prior to co-prescription to maximize cardiac benefit and minimize the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>Search for pharmacokinetic studies showing PPIs reduce clopidogrel active metabolite and reduced platelet inhibition; also search for analyses showing no clinical harm in randomized trials (COGENT) and subgroup analyses for ticagrelor/prasugrel.</think>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">clopidogrel omeprazole pharmacokinetics active metabolite</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 28 results.

Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits the platelet P2Y₁₂ adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, decreasing platelet activation and aggregation processes. Atorvastatin, omeprazole, and several other drugs have been shown in pharmacodynamic studies to competitively inhibit CYP activation of clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel responsiveness. Conversely, other agents increase clopidogrel responsiveness by inducing CYP activity. The clinical implications of these pharmacodynamic interactions have raised concern because many of these drugs are coadministered to patients with coronary artery disease. There are multiple challenges in proving that a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction is clinically significant. To date, there is no consistent evidence that clopidogrel-drug interactions impact adverse cardiovascular events. Statins and proton pump inhibitors have been shown to decrease adverse clinical event rates and should not be withheld from patients with appropriate indications for therapy because of concern about potential clopidogrel-drug interactions. Clinicians concerned about clopidogrel-drug interactions have the option of prescribing either an alternative platelet P2Y₁₂ receptor inhibitor without known drug interactions, or statin and gastro-protective agents that do not interfere with clopidogrel metabolism.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39439219\">Title: The effect of concurrent clopidogrel and omeprazole administration on clopidogrel metabolism and platelet function in healthy cats.\nAuthors: Plante, Christina, Lee, Pamela M, Haines, Jillian M et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Journal of veterinary internal medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nSome studies in humans show that the concurrent use of clopidogrel and omeprazole decreases plasma clopidogrel active metabolite (CAM) concentrations and clopidogrel antiplatelet effects. Whether this drug interaction occurs in cats is unknown.\nHYPOTHESIS\nWe hypothesized that administration of clopidogrel with omeprazole would decrease plasma CAM concentrations and decrease clopidogrel antiplatelet effects in healthy cats.\nANIMALS\nTen domestic cats.\nMETHODS\nIn this 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment randomized crossover study, healthy cats were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel only (18.75 mg PO q24h) or clopidogrel with omeprazole (1 mg/kg PO q12h) for 10 days, followed by a 2-week washout period, and then the opposite treatment for another 10 days. Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture on days 0, 5, and 10. Plasma CAM concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Platelet function was evaluated using Plateletworks, Multiplate Analyzer, and Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (PFA-100).\nRESULTS\nMultiplate Analyzer and PFA-100 detected no difference in platelet function between days or treatment groups. Plateletworks detected a significant difference (P < .001) in platelet function from day 0 to 5 and day 0 to 10 in both treatment groups but no difference between treatment groups. Plasma CAM concentrations were significantly lower on day 10 (P < .02) in cats receiving both medications versus clopidogrel only.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE\nConcurrent omeprazole and clopidogrel administration was associated with altered pharmacokinetics on day 10, but no difference in pharmacodynamics between the 2 treatment groups. The short-term use of clopidogrel and omeprazole does not seem to alter platelet function significantly.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24677117\">Title: Effect of esomeprazole with/without acetylsalicylic acid, omeprazole and lansoprazole on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel in healthy volunteers.\nAuthors: Andersson, Tommy, Nagy, Peter, Niazi, Mohammad et al. | Year: 2014 | Journal: American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nThe effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel was assessed in two healthy volunteer crossover studies.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nStudy 1: subjects received clopidogrel alone (300-mg loading dose, then 75 mg/day for 28 days) and two of three PPIs (omeprazole 80 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg or lansoprazole 60 mg) plus clopidogrel for 29 days in three treatment periods (randomized treatment sequence assignment). Study 2: subjects received clopidogrel alone (75 mg/day for 9 days) and clopidogrel alone for 4 days followed by clopidogrel plus fixed-combination esomeprazole 20 mg/low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg for 5 days in two treatment periods (randomized treatment sequence assignment). Pharmacokinetic effects were estimated by measuring active metabolite of clopidogrel, and pharmacodynamic effects by inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation.\nRESULTS\nThere was a relative decrease of up to 50 % in exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel with the different PPIs (study 1), and close to 40 % with esomeprazole/low-dose ASA (study 2), compared with clopidogrel alone. There was an absolute decrease of up to 17 % in inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation with co-administration of different PPIs, compared with clopidogrel alone; however, no differences in platelet inhibition were observed during co-administration with the esomeprazole/low-dose ASA fixed-dose combination.\nCONCLUSION\nOmeprazole, esomeprazole and lansoprazole decreased systemic exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel in healthy volunteers, leading to modest decreases in its antiplatelet effect. However, no apparent differences in platelet inhibition were observed when esomeprazole was co-administered with low-dose ASA as a fixed-dose combination.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"22464259\">Title: A randomized, 2-period, crossover design study to assess the effects of dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and omeprazole on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel in healthy volunteers.\nAuthors: Frelinger, Andrew L, Lee, Ronald D, Mulford, Darcy J et al. | Year: 2012 | Journal: Journal of the American College of Cardiology\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study was to assess the effects of different proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel.\nBACKGROUND\nMetabolism of clopidogrel requires cytochrome P450s (CYPs), including CYP2C19. However, PPIs may inhibit CYP2C19, potentially reducing the effectiveness of clopidogrel.\nMETHODS\nA randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover study of healthy subjects (n = 160, age 18 to 55 years, homozygous for CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer genotype, confined, standardized diet) was conducted. Clopidogrel 75 mg with or without a PPI (dexlansoprazole 60 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg, or, as a positive control to maximize potential interaction and demonstrate assay sensitivity, omeprazole 80 mg) was given daily for 9 days. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed on days 9 and 10. Pharmacodynamic end-points were vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein P2Y(12) platelet reactivity index, maximal platelet aggregation to 5 and 20 μmol/l adenosine diphosphate, and VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet response units.\nRESULTS\nPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses with omeprazole demonstrated assay sensitivity. The area under the curve for clopidogrel active metabolite decreased significantly with esomeprazole but not with dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole. Similarly, esomeprazole but not dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole significantly reduced the effect of clopidogrel on vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index. All PPIs decreased the peak plasma concentration of clopidogrel active metabolite (omeprazole > esomeprazole > lansoprazole > dexlansoprazole) and showed a corresponding order of potency for effects on maximal platelet aggregation and platelet response units.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGeneration of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function were reduced less by the coadministration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the coadministration of esomeprazole or omeprazole. These results suggest that the potential of PPIs to attenuate the efficacy of clopidogrel could be minimized by the use of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole rather than esomeprazole or omeprazole.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"20844485\">Title: Differential effects of omeprazole and pantoprazole on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in healthy subjects: randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover comparison studies.\nAuthors: Angiolillo, D J, Gibson, C M, Cheng, S et al. | Year: 2011 | Journal: Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics\nAbstract: Four randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were conducted among 282 healthy subjects to investigate whether an interaction exists between clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose/75-mg/day maintenance dose) and the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole (80 mg) when they are administered simultaneously (study 1); whether the interaction, if any, can be mitigated by administering clopidogrel and omeprazole 12 h apart (study 2) or by increasing clopidogrel to 600-mg loading/150-mg/day maintenance dosing (study 3); and whether the interaction applies equally to the PPI pantoprazole (80 mg) (study 4). Relative to levels after administration of clopidogrel alone in studies 1,2,3, and 4, coadministration of PPI decreased the AUC(0-24) of the clopidogrel active metabolite H4 by 40, 47, 41, and 14% (P ≤ 0.002), respectively; increased maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) induced by 5 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by 8.0, 5.6, 8.1, and 4.3% (P ≤ 0.014), respectively; and increased the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation-platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI) by 20.7, 27.1, 19.0 (P < 0.0001), and 3.9% (P = 0.3319), respectively.

Gastrointestinal complications, including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often prescribed. However, potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been suggested for PPIs, and, in recent years, it has been discussed whether these drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, clopidogrel. Indeed, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an interaction through hepatic CYP2C19 between PPIs and clopidogrel, which could translate into clinical inefficacy, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular events. The FDA and the EMA sent a warning in 2010 discouraging the concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In addition, whether the use of PPIs may affect the clinical efficacy of the new P2Y 12 receptor antagonists, ticagrelor and prasugrel, remains less known. According to current guidelines, PPIs in combination with antiplatelet treatment are recommended in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent use of anticoagulants, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection. Like vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs can determine gastrointestinal bleeding. Results from both randomized clinical trials and observational studies suggest that high-dose dabigatran (150 mg bid), rivaroxaban and high-dose edoxaban (60 mg daily) are associated with a higher risk of GI bleeding as compared with apixaban and warfarin. In patients taking oral anticoagulant with GI risk factor, PPI could be recommended, even if usefulness of PPIs in these patients deserves further data. Helicobacter pylori should always be searched, and treated, in patients with history of peptic ulcer disease (with or without complication). Given the large number of patients treated with antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet inhibition or anticoagulant effect potentially carries a considerable clinical impact. The present joint statement by ANMCO and AIGO summarizes the current knowledge regarding the widespread use of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, and PPIs in combination.

A concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often prescribed in these patients, as gastrointestinal complications are relatively frequent. On the other hand, a potential increased risk of cardiovascular events has been suggested in patients treated with PPIs; in particular, it has been discussed whether these drugs may reduce the cardiovascular protection of clopidogrel, due to pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions through hepatic metabolism. Previously, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and omeprazole or esomeprazole has been discouraged. In contrast, it remains less known whether PPI use may affect the clinical efficacy of ticagrelor and prasugrel, new P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Current guidelines recommend PPI use in combination with antiplatelet treatment in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, including advanced age, concurrent use of anticoagulants, steroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infection. In patients taking oral anticoagulant with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, PPIs could be recommended, even if their usefulness deserves further data. H. pylori infection should always be investigated and treated in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (with or without complication) treated with antithrombotic drugs.

The potential interaction between PPIs and antiplatelet agents has been widely discussed, but doubts remain as to whether PPIs may reduce the cardiovascular protection provided by aspirin, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel.\nAREAS COVERED\nMany pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have confirmed the interaction, especially between PPIs and clopidogrel, but with uncertain consequences on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to summarize the evidence for the widespread combined use of oral antiplatelet drugs and PPIs, to outline the current evidence supporting or opposing drug-drug interaction, and to discuss the clinical implications of such interactions.\nEXPERT OPINION\nA large body of evidence describes the PK/PD interaction of antiplatelet drugs with PPIs and its potential role in increasing clinical cardiovascular adverse events, but no solid clinical data have confirmed these effects. In the light of the published studies, there seems to be no restriction on the choice of PPI with aspirin, prasugrel, and/or ticagrelor. The choice of a PPI with no (or minimal) interference with the hepatic cytochrome P450 2C19 is preferred in patients receiving clopidogrel.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24205916\">Title: Antiplatelet drug interactions with proton pump inhibitors.\nAuthors: Scott, Stuart A, Owusu Obeng, Aniwaa, Hulot, Jean-Sébastien | Year: 2014 | Journal: Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nNon-aspirin antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) are commonly prescribed for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events among patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and/or those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In addition, combination therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is often recommended to attenuate gastrointestinal bleeding risk, particularly during dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin. Importantly, a pharmacological interaction between clopidogrel and some PPIs has been proposed based on mutual CYP450-dependent metabolism, but available evidence is inconsistent.\nAREAS COVERED\nThis article provides an overview of the currently approved antiplatelet agents and PPIs, including their metabolic pathways. Additionally, the CYP450 isoenzyme at the center of the drug interaction, CYP2C19, is described in detail, and the available evidence on both the potential pharmacological interaction and influence on clinical outcomes are summarized and evaluated.\nEXPERT OPINION\nAlthough concomitant DAPT and PPI use reduces clopidogrel active metabolite levels and ex vivo-measured platelet inhibition, the influence of the drug interaction on clinical outcomes has been conflicting and largely reported from non-randomized observational studies. Despite this inconsistency, a clinically important interaction cannot be definitively excluded, particularly among patient subgroups with higher overall cardiovascular risk and potentially among CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriers.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27628008\">Title: Proton Pump Inhibitors in Cardiovascular Disease: Drug Interactions with Antiplatelet Drugs.\nAuthors: Würtz, Morten, Grove, Erik L | Year: 2017 | Journal: Advances in experimental medicine and biology\nAbstract: Aspirin and P2Y 12 receptor antagonists are widely used across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. Upper gastrointestinal complications, including ulcer and bleeding, are relatively common during antiplatelet treatment and, therefore, concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment is often prescribed.PPIs provide gastroprotection by changing the intragastric milieu, essentially by raising intragastric pH. In recent years, it has been heavily discussed whether PPIs may reduce the cardiovascular protection by aspirin and, even more so, clopidogrel. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies suggested an interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, and subsequent clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the clinical impact of this interaction. More recently, it was reported that PPIs may also attenuate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. This may be clinically important, because a fixed combination of aspirin and a PPI (esomeprazole) has recently been approved and because aspirin is the most widely used drug in patients with cardiovascular disease. The antiplatelet effect of the new P2Y 12 receptor antagonists, ticagrelor and prasugrel, seems less influenced by PPI co-treatment.Given the large number of patients treated with antithrombotic drugs and PPIs, even a minor reduction of platelet inhibition potentially carries considerable clinical impact. The present book chapter summarizes the evidence regarding the widespread use of platelet inhibitors and PPIs in combination. Moreover, it outlines current evidence supporting or opposing drug interactions between these drugs and discusses clinical implications.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>Summary (Phase‑III trial populations and related PK/PD data)\n\n- Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics (mechanism and healthy‑volunteer data)\n  - PPIs (especially omeprazole and esomeprazole) inhibit CYP2C19 and reduce formation of clopidogrel’s active metabolite (reports of ~30–50% lower exposure) with corresponding attenuation of ex‑vivo platelet inhibition (modest absolute reductions in ADP‑induced aggregation / P2Y12 response indices).

However, in patients on this combination of drugs, there is no conclusive evidence of an increase in adverse cardiovascular events. From pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic perspectives, there is a real interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs because of the competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 isoenzyme which is required for biotransformation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. The consequent decrease in the availability of this active metabolite leads to attenuation of antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel. In several observational trials, it was shown that decreased antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel due to PPIs may translate into poor cardiovascular outcomes. However, an incomplete RCT (COGENT) and a post hoc analysis of two large trials (PRINCIPLE-TIMI 44 and TRITON-TIMI 38 trial) showed no significant adverse cardiovascular events with this combination. Caution is however needed in patients who are hypometabolizers of clopidogrel putting them at a higher risk of adverse coronary events. Since 3% of patients are likely to be hypometabolizers of clopidogrel, routine combination of clopidogrel and PPIs should be avoided. There is a heightened awareness of this interaction following multiple advisory warnings. At the same time, one should not withhold PPIs in patients who are at a high risk of developing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. In these patients, selected choices of PPI such as pantoprazole may be helpful and for low risk patients, serious consideration should be given to H(2) receptor antagonists or antacids. Therefore, while not compromising the cardioprotective effect of antiplatelet agents, the gastroprotective benefit of PPI should be strongly considered in patients who need both.

Clopidogrel is a pro drug and is metabolised by liver enzymes, particularly CYP2C19, into its active form. A considerable proportion of patients have a poor response to clopidogrel and this may be due to several factors. Genetic polymorphisms involved in clopidogrel's absorption, metabolism and activity at the platelet may interfere with its antiplatelet actions. Further, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may interfere with clopidogrel's actions by functionally reducing the ability of CYP2C19 to convert clopidogrel to its active metabolite. By attenuating clopidogrel's actions, both polymorphisms and drug interactions may increase the risk of thrombotic events during clopidogrel therapy.

Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits the platelet P2Y₁₂ adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, decreasing platelet activation and aggregation processes. Atorvastatin, omeprazole, and several other drugs have been shown in pharmacodynamic studies to competitively inhibit CYP activation of clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel responsiveness. Conversely, other agents increase clopidogrel responsiveness by inducing CYP activity. The clinical implications of these pharmacodynamic interactions have raised concern because many of these drugs are coadministered to patients with coronary artery disease. There are multiple challenges in proving that a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction is clinically significant. To date, there is no consistent evidence that clopidogrel-drug interactions impact adverse cardiovascular events.

Clopidogrel 75 mg with or without a PPI (dexlansoprazole 60 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg, or, as a positive control to maximize potential interaction and demonstrate assay sensitivity, omeprazole 80 mg) was given daily for 9 days.

Whether nutritional support during hospitalization reduces these risks, or on the contrary, may be harmful due to an increase in salt and fluid intake, remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this trial was to study the effect of nutritional support on mortality in patients hospitalized with chronic heart failure who are at nutritional risk.\nMETHODS\nA total of 645 patients with chronic heart failure (36% [n = 234] with acute decompensation) participated in the investigator-initiated, open-label EFFORT (Effect of early nutritional support on Frailty, Functional Outcomes and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients) trial. Patients were randomized to protocol-guided individualized nutritional support to reach energy, protein, and micronutrient goals (intervention group) or standard hospital food (control group). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days.\nRESULTS\nMortality over 180 days increased with higher severity of malnutrition (odds ratio per 1-point increase in Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 score: 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 2.24; p = 0.001). By 30 days, 27 of 321 intervention group patients (8.4%) died, compared with 48 of 324 (14.8%) control group patients (odds ratio: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.75; p = 0.002). Patients at high nutritional risk showed the most benefit from nutritional support. Mortality effects remained significant at 180-day follow-up. Intervention group patients also had a lower risk for major cardiovascular events at 30 days (17.4% vs. 26.9%; odds ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.75; p = 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong hospitalized patients with chronic heart failure at high nutritional risk, individualized nutritional support reduced the risk for mortality and major cardiovascular events compared with standard hospital food. These data support malnutrition screening upon hospital admission followed by an individualized nutritional support strategy in this vulnerable patient population.

We aimed to evaluate whether admission Norton scoring system predicts adverse outcomes among heart failure patients.\nMETHODS\nThe study population comprised 4388 acute heart failure patients between the years 2008 and 2017. Patients were allocated to 3 groups according to their admission Norton score [(≤15-low, 16-18-intermediate, and ≥19-high)]. Primary outcome included all-cause mortality at 30, 90 days, and 1 year. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to assess the independent association between Norton score and mortality. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) analysis was used to asses Norton's additive predictive ability upon known prognostic factors.\nRESULTS\nAmong 4388 study patients, 32% (n=1611) had low Norton score, 28% (n=1384) intermediate score, and 40% (n=1900) high score. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly higher 30-day mortality among patients with a low Norton score as compared with those with intermediate or high score (2.6%, 6.3%, and 16.1%; log rank p<0.001). A similar trend was noted at 90 days and 1 year. Multivariate analysis found Norton score to be an independent predictor of mortality with each one-point decrement associated with a significant 15% increased risk for 30-day mortality [HR=1.15 (95%CI, 1.12-1.17) p<0.001]. NRI analysis showed an improvement of 21.5% (95%CI 18.3-25.1%) predicting 1-year mortality.\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings show that the admission Norton score is a powerful marker of short- and long-term mortality. These data suggest that the scale should be added as a risk stratification tool in this high-risk population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36996756\">Title: Fast systematic geriatric assessment in acute heart failure patients admitted in Cardiology.\nAuthors: Aguilar-Iglesias, Lara, Merino-Merino, Ana, Sanchez-Corral, Ester et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Heart & lung : the journal of critical care\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nHeart failure prevalence is increasing in elder adults. These patients usually present geriatric syndromes, especially frailty. The effect of frailty on heart failure is under discussion but there are few data about the clinical characterization of frail patients who are admitted for acute heart failure decompensation.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe purpose of this study was to study the differences in clinical baseline variables and geriatric scales between frail and non-frail patients admitted to the Cardiology unit via the Emergency Department for acute heart failure.\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled all patients with acute heart failure who were admitted to the Cardiology unit from the Emergency Department of our hospital from July 2020 through May 2021. A multidimensional and comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed at the moment of admission. We studied differences in baseline variables and geriatric scales according to the frailty status determined by the FRAIL scale.\nRESULTS\nA total of 202 patients were included. In the whole population, 68 (33.7%) patients presented frailty defined by a FRAIL score ≥ 3. The frail patients were older (80±9 vs. 69±12 years; p<0.001), and had a worse quality of life (58.31±12.18 vs.39.26±13.71 points; p<0.001) according to the Minnesota scale, presented high comorbidity (47 (69.1%) vs. 67 (50.4%) patients; p = 0.011) defined as ≥3 points according to the Charlson scale and were more dependent (40 (58.8%) vs. 25 (18.8%) patients; p<0.001) according to the Barthel scale. The frail patients presented higher MAGGIC risk scores (24.09±4.99 vs. 18.89±6.26; p<0.001). Despite this adverse profile, the treatments prescribed during the admission and at the hospital discharge were similar.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe prevalence of geriatric syndromes, especially frailty, is very high in patients admitted for acute heart failure. Frail patients with acute heart failure had an adverse clinical profile with more prevalence of concomitant geriatric syndromes. Therefore, we consider that a geriatric assessment should be performed during the admission of acute heart failure patients to improve care and attention.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37672640\">Title: Association between walking speed early after admission and all-cause death and/or re-admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\nAuthors: Nozaki, Kohei, Hamazaki, Nobuaki, Kamiya, Kentaro et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: European journal of cardiovascular nursing\nAbstract: AIMS\nPatients with heart failure (HF) frequently experience decreased physical function, including walking speed. Slower walking speed is associated with poorer prognosis. However, most of these reports focused on patients with stable HF, and the relationship between walking speed in acute phase and clinical outcomes is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between walking speed early after admission and clinical events in patients with acute decompensated HF (ADHF).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe reviewed consecutive 1391 patients admitted due to ADHF. We measured walking speed the first time to walk on the ward more than 10 m after admission, and the speed within 4 days after admission was included in this study. The primary outcome was combined events (all-cause death and/or re-admission due to HF). The follow-up period was up to 1 year from the discharge. The study population had a median age of 74 years [interquartile range (IQR): 65-80 years], and 35.9% of patients were females. The median walking speed was 0.70 m/s (IQR: 0.54-0.88 m/s). Combined events occurred in 429 (30.8%) patients. Faster walking speed was independently associated with lower rate of combined events (adjusted hazard ratio per 0.1 m/s increasing: 0.951, 95% confidence interval: 0.912-0.992).\nCONCLUSION\nFaster walking speed within 4 days after admission was associated with favourable clinical outcomes in patients with ADHF. The results suggest that measuring walking speed in acute phase is useful for earlier risk stratification.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37516829\">Title: Telerehabilitation in patients with recent hospitalisation due to acute decompensated heart failure: protocol for the Tele-ADHF randomised controlled trial.\nAuthors: van Leunen, Mayke M C J, de Lathauwer, Ignace L J, Verstappen, Cindy C A G et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: BMC cardiovascular disorders\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCardiac rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) has favourable effects on exercise capacity, the risk at hospital (re-)admission and quality of life. Although cardiac rehabilitation is generally recommended it is still under-utilised in daily clinical practice, particularly in frail elderly patients after hospital admission, mainly due to low referral and patient-related barriers. Cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) has the potential to partially solve these barriers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of CTR as compared to standard remote care after hospital admission on physical functional capacity in CHF patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this randomised controlled trial, 64 CHF patients will be recruited during hospitalisation for acute decompensated heart failure, and randomised to CTR combined with remote patient management (RPM) or RPM alone (1:1). All participants will start with RPM after hospital discharge for early detection of deterioration, and will be up titrated to optimal medical therapy before being randomised. CTR will start after randomisation and consists of an 18-week multidisciplinary programme with exercise training by physical and occupational therapists, supported by a (remote) technology-assisted dietary intervention and mental health guiding by a physiologist. The training programme consists of three centre-based and two home-based video exercise training sessions followed by weekly video coaching. The mental health and dietary programme are executed using individual and group video sessions. A wrist-worn device enables remote coaching by the physical therapist. The web application is used for promoting self-management by the following modules: 1) goal setting, 2) progress tracking, 3) education, and 4) video and chat communication. The primary outcome measure is physical functional capacity evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score. Secondary outcome measures include frailty scoring, recovery after submaximal exercise, subjective health status, compliance and acceptance to the rehabilitation programme, and readmission rate.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Tele-ADHF trial is the first prospective randomised controlled trial designed for evaluating the effects of a comprehensive combined RPM and CTR programme in recently hospitalised CHF patients. We hypothesize that this intervention has superior effects on physical functional capacity than RPM alone.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nNetherlands Trial Registry (NTR) NL9619, registered 21 July 2021.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>I will run a second PubMed search to capture studies linking frailty at admission with mortality, readmission, and functional recovery in acute heart failure.</think>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">frailty acute heart failure mortality readmission</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 49 results.

Heart failure\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nExercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves health-related quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF). However, CR efficacy in patients with HF who are elderly, frail, or have HF with preserved ejection fraction remains unclear. We examined whether participation in multidisciplinary outpatient CR is associated with long-term survival and rehospitalization in patients with HF, with subgroup analysis by age, sex, comorbidities, frailty, and HF with preserved ejection fraction.\nMETHODS\nThis multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed in patients hospitalized for acute HF at 15 hospitals in Japan, 2007 to 2016. The primary outcome (composite of all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization after discharge) and secondary outcomes (all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization) were analyzed in outpatient CR program participants versus nonparticipants.\nRESULTS\nOf the 3277 patients, 26% (862) participated in outpatient CR. After propensity matching for potential confounders, 1592 patients were included (n=796 pairs), of which 511 had composite outcomes (223 [14%] all-cause deaths and 392 [25%] HF rehospitalizations, median 2.4-year follow-up). Hazard ratios associated with CR participation were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.92) for composite outcome, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.51-0.87) for all-cause mortality, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-0.99) for HF-related rehospitalization. CR participation was also associated with numerically lower rates of composite outcome in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction or frail patients.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOutpatient CR participation was associated with substantial prognostic benefit in a large HF cohort regardless of age, sex, comorbidities, frailty, and HF with preserved ejection fraction.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27185193\">Title: Management of acute heart failure in elderly patients.\nAuthors: Teixeira, Antonio, Arrigo, Mattia, Tolppanen, Heli et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Archives of cardiovascular diseases\nAbstract: Acute heart failure (AHF) is the most common cause of unplanned hospital admissions, and is associated with high mortality rates. Over the next few decades, the combination of improved cardiovascular disease survival and progressive ageing of the population will further increase the prevalence of AHF in developed countries. New recommendations on the management of AHF have been published recently, but as elderly patients are under-represented in clinical trials, and scientific evidence is often lacking, the diagnosis and management of AHF in this population is challenging. The clinical presentation of AHF, especially in patients aged>85years, differs substantially from that in younger patients, with unspecific symptoms, such as fatigue and confusion, often overriding dyspnoea. Older patients also have a different risk profile compared with younger patients: often heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and infection as the most frequent precipitating factor of AHF. Moreover, co-morbidities, disability and frailty are common, and increase morbidity, recovery time, readmission rates and mortality; their presence should be detected during a geriatric assessment. Diagnostics and treatment for AHF should be tailored according to cardiopulmonary and geriatric status, giving special attention to the patient's preferences for care. Whereas many elderly AHF patients may be managed similarly to younger patients, different strategies should be applied in the presence of relevant co-morbidities, disability and frailty. The option of palliative care should be considered at an early stage, to avoid unnecessary and harmful diagnostics and treatments.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33834270\">Title: Clinical impact of functional independent measure (FIM) on 180-day readmission and mortality in elderly patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure.\nAuthors: Iwata, Kentaro, Kitai, Takeshi, Yoshimura, Yoshihiro et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Heart and vessels\nAbstract: Activities of daily living (ADL) are important prognostic factors for heart failure. The functional independent measure (FIM) has emerged as a comprehensive valid measure of ADL from both physical and cognitive perspectives. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of the FIM score on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We retrospectively analyzed 473 ADHF patients, with available pre-discharge FIM scores, admitted to our institution between May 2018 and May 2020. Primary outcome measures, defined as a composite of 180-day all-cause deaths and readmissions, were compared among three tertiles. The median FIM score was 102 (interquartile range: 85-115). Tertile 1 corresponded to an FIM score > 111 (n = 154), Tertile 2 to that of 90-111 (n = 167), and Tertile 3 to that of < 90 (n = 152). During follow-up, 28 deaths and 114 readmissions occurred. Patients with lower FIM scores were associated with a graded increase in the risk of primary outcome measure (p = 0.001). Even after multivariable adjustment, the results remained significant [Tertile 1 vs 3; adjusted hazard ratio: 3.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.72-6.56), p < 0.001; Tertile 2 vs 3; 2.32 (1.27-4.47), p = 0.006]. FIM scores were significantly associated with readmission or death within 180 days of discharge in hospitalized ADHF patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37848804\">Title: Predicting mortality and re-hospitalization for heart failure: a machine-learning and cluster analysis on frailty and comorbidity.\nAuthors: Okoye, Chukwuma, Mazzarone, Tessa, Niccolai, Filippo et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Aging clinical and experimental research\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nMachine-learning techniques have been recently utilized to predict the probability of unfavorable outcomes among elderly patients suffering from heart failure (HF); yet none has integrated an assessment for frailty and comorbidity. This research seeks to determine which machine-learning-based phenogroups that incorporate frailty and comorbidity are most strongly correlated with death or readmission at hospital for HF within six months following discharge from hospital.\nMETHODS\nIn this single-center, prospective study of a tertiary care center, we included all patients aged 65 and older discharged for acute decompensated heart failure. Random forest analysis and a Cox multivariable regression were performed to determine the predictors of the composite endpoint. By k-means and hierarchical clustering, those predictors were utilized to phenomapping the cohort in four different clusters.\nRESULTS\nA total of 571 patients were included in the study. Cluster analysis identified four different clusters according to frailty, burden of comorbidities and BNP. As compared with Cluster 4, we found an increased 6-month risk of poor outcomes patients in Cluster 1 (very frail and comorbid; HR 3.53 [95% CI 2.30-5.39]), Cluster 2 (pre-frail with low levels of BNP; HR 2.59 [95% CI 1.66-4.07], and in Cluster 3 (pre-frail and comorbid with high levels of BNP; HR 3.75 [95% CI 2.25-6.27])).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn older patients discharged for ADHF, the cluster analysis identified four distinct phenotypes according to frailty degree, comorbidity, and BNP levels. Further studies are warranted to validate these phenogroups and to guide an appropriate selection of personalized, model of care.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33667443\">Title: Frailty and Post-hospitalization Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.\nAuthors: Goyal, Parag, Yum, Brian, Navid, Pedram et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The American journal of cardiology\nAbstract: Given the role of comorbid conditions in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, we aimed to identify and rank the importance of comorbid conditions associated with post-hospitalization outcomes of older adults hospitalized for HFpEF. We examined data from 4,605 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 2007-2014 for HFpEF based on ICD-9-CM codes for acute diastolic heart failure (428.31 or 428.33). To identify characteristics with high importance for prediction of mortality, all-cause rehospitalization, rehospitalization for heart failure, and composite outcome of mortality or all-cause rehospitalization up to 1 year, we developed boosted decision tree ensembles for each outcome, separately. For interpretability, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards models. Age and frailty were the most important characteristics for prediction of mortality. Frailty was the most important characteristic for prediction of rehospitalization, rehospitalization for heart failure, and the composite outcome of mortality or all-cause rehospitalization. In Cox proportional hazards models, a 1-SD higher frailty score (0.1 on theoretical range of 0 to 1) was associated with a HR of 1.27 (1.06 to 1.52) for mortality, 1.16 (1.07 to 1.25) for all-cause rehospitalization, 1.24 (1.14 to 1.35) for HF rehospitalization, and 1.15 (1.07 to 1.25) for the composite outcome of mortality or all-cause rehospitalization. In conclusion, frailty is an important predictor of mortality and rehospitalization in adults aged ≥66 years with HFpEF.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>Summary answer\n- Frailty assessed at hospital admission in older adults with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is consistently associated with worse short‑term outcomes: higher short‑term mortality, greater likelihood of early readmission, and poorer functional recovery after discharge.\n\nEvidence and effect sizes (selected studies)\n- Short‑term mortality: Lower admission frailty scores predict higher early mortality. In a large cohort using the Norton score, each 1‑point decrement was independently associated with ~15% higher 30‑day mortality (HR ≈1.15) and significantly worse 90‑day and 1‑year survival <cite id=\"32534818\">32534818</cite>. Frailty measured as a continuous score was also an important predictor of post‑hospital mortality in older patients with HFpEF <cite id=\"33667443\">33667443</cite>.\n- Readmission: Frailty and worse functional status predict early (months) readmission. Lower functional independence (FIM) at discharge was strongly associated with a graded increase in the combined outcome of 180‑day death or readmission (adjusted HRs >2–3 for the lowest FIM tertile) <cite id=\"33834270\">33834270</cite>. Cluster/phenogroup analyses that included frailty identified “very frail” phenotypes with markedly higher 6‑month risks of death or rehospitalization (HR ≈3.5) <cite id=\"37848804\">37848804</cite>.\n- Functional recovery: Objective measures of early physical performance after admission (e.g., walking speed in the first days) predict subsequent combined events (death/re‑admission) and reflect recovery potential—faster early walking speed was independently associated with lower combined event rates (adjusted HR per 0.1 m/s increase ≈0.95) <cite id=\"37672640\">37672640</cite>. Frail patients are more likely to be older, more comorbid and more dependent at baseline, and thus have worse functional recovery trajectories <cite id=\"36996756\">36996756</cite>.\n\nClinical implications and mitigation\n- Screening: Routine frailty and functional assessment at admission (e.g., Norton score, gait speed, FIM/SPPB) identifies patients at high short‑term risk and can guide care planning <cite id=\"32534818\">32534818</cite><cite id=\"37672640\">37672640</cite><cite id=\"33834270\">33834270</cite>.\n- Interventions: Multidisciplinary outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and targeted in‑hospital interventions (nutrition, early mobilization, geriatric co‑management) are plausible strategies to reduce adverse outcomes in frail HF patients; observational data link rehab participation with lower mortality and rehospitalization, and trials/protocols (nutritional support, telerehabilitation) are testing targeted approaches <cite id=\"32986957\">32986957</cite><cite id=\"33958128\">33958128</cite><cite id=\"37516829\">37516829</cite>.\n\nBottom line\n- Frailty at admission in older adults with ADHF is a strong, independent predictor of short‑term mortality and readmission and signals reduced potential for functional recovery. Early identification should prompt geriatric assessment and targeted interventions (nutrition, early mobilization/rehab, discharge planning) to try to improve short‑term outcomes.\n\nSelected citations\n- Norton score predicts 30‑day mortality and longer‑term outcomes <cite id=\"32534818\">32534818</cite>.\n- Early walking speed after admission predicts combined death/readmission (per 0.1 m/s) <cite id=\"37672640\">37672640</cite>.\n- Low FIM (functional dependence) associated with higher 180‑day death/readmission (adjusted HRs ≈2–3) <cite id=\"33834270\">33834270</cite>.\n- Frailty clusters linked to ~3–4× higher 6‑month poor outcomes <cite id=\"37848804\">37848804</cite>.\n- Frailty important predictor of mortality and rehospitalization in HFpEF cohorts <cite id=\"33667443\">33667443</cite>.\n- Observational data support benefit of multidisciplinary cardiac rehab; trials underway for targeted interventions (nutrition, telerehab) <cite id=\"32986957\">32986957</cite><cite id=\"33958128\">33958128</cite><cite id=\"37516829\">37516829</cite>.</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "frailty admission acute decompensated heart failure older adults", "result": {"total": 13, "data": [{"paperId": "33958128", "title": "Individualized Nutritional Support for Hospitalized Patients With Chronic Heart Failure.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDeterioration of nutritional status during hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure increases mortality.

The primary outcome was combined events (all-cause death and/or re-admission due to HF). The follow-up period was up to 1 year from the discharge. The study population had a median age of 74 years [interquartile range (IQR): 65-80 years], and 35.9% of patients were females. The median walking speed was 0.70 m/s (IQR: 0.54-0.88 m/s). Combined events occurred in 429 (30.8%) patients. Faster walking speed was independently associated with lower rate of combined events (adjusted hazard ratio per 0.1 m/s increasing: 0.951, 95% confidence interval: 0.912-0.992).\nCONCLUSION\nFaster walking speed within 4 days after admission was associated with favourable clinical outcomes in patients with ADHF.

Although cardiac rehabilitation is generally recommended it is still under-utilised in daily clinical practice, particularly in frail elderly patients after hospital admission, mainly due to low referral and patient-related barriers. Cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) has the potential to partially solve these barriers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of CTR as compared to standard remote care after hospital admission on physical functional capacity in CHF patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this randomised controlled trial, 64 CHF patients will be recruited during hospitalisation for acute decompensated heart failure, and randomised to CTR combined with remote patient management (RPM) or RPM alone (1:1). All participants will start with RPM after hospital discharge for early detection of deterioration, and will be up titrated to optimal medical therapy before being randomised. CTR will start after randomisation and consists of an 18-week multidisciplinary programme with exercise training by physical and occupational therapists, supported by a (remote) technology-assisted dietary intervention and mental health guiding by a physiologist. The training programme consists of three centre-based and two home-based video exercise training sessions followed by weekly video coaching. The mental health and dietary programme are executed using individual and group video sessions. A wrist-worn device enables remote coaching by the physical therapist. The web application is used for promoting self-management by the following modules: 1) goal setting, 2) progress tracking, 3) education, and 4) video and chat communication. The primary outcome measure is physical functional capacity evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score. Secondary outcome measures include frailty scoring, recovery after submaximal exercise, subjective health status, compliance and acceptance to the rehabilitation programme, and readmission rate.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Tele-ADHF trial is the first prospective randomised controlled trial designed for evaluating the effects of a comprehensive combined RPM and CTR programme in recently hospitalised CHF patients. We hypothesize that this intervention has superior effects on physical functional capacity than RPM alone.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nNetherlands Trial Registry (NTR) NL9619, registered 21 July 2021.", "year": "2023", "venue": "BMC cardiovascular disorders"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T15:26:55.760188"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "frailty acute heart failure mortality readmission", "result": {"total": 49, "data": [{"paperId": "32986957", "title": "Multidisciplinary Cardiac Rehabilitation and Long-Term Prognosis in Patients With Heart Failure.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nExercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves health-related quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (HF).

Over the next few decades, the combination of improved cardiovascular disease survival and progressive ageing of the population will further increase the prevalence of AHF in developed countries. New recommendations on the management of AHF have been published recently, but as elderly patients are under-represented in clinical trials, and scientific evidence is often lacking, the diagnosis and management of AHF in this population is challenging. The clinical presentation of AHF, especially in patients aged>85years, differs substantially from that in younger patients, with unspecific symptoms, such as fatigue and confusion, often overriding dyspnoea. Older patients also have a different risk profile compared with younger patients: often heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and infection as the most frequent precipitating factor of AHF. Moreover, co-morbidities, disability and frailty are common, and increase morbidity, recovery time, readmission rates and mortality; their presence should be detected during a geriatric assessment. Diagnostics and treatment for AHF should be tailored according to cardiopulmonary and geriatric status, giving special attention to the patient's preferences for care. Whereas many elderly AHF patients may be managed similarly to younger patients, different strategies should be applied in the presence of relevant co-morbidities, disability and frailty.

In a large cohort using the Norton score, each 1‑point decrement was independently associated with ~15% higher 30‑day mortality (HR ≈1.15) and significantly worse 90‑day and 1‑year survival <cite id=\"32534818\">32534818</cite>. Frailty measured as a continuous score was also an important predictor of post‑hospital mortality in older patients with HFpEF <cite id=\"33667443\">33667443</cite>.\n- Readmission: Frailty and worse functional status predict early (months) readmission. Lower functional independence (FIM) at discharge was strongly associated with a graded increase in the combined outcome of 180‑day death or readmission (adjusted HRs >2–3 for the lowest FIM tertile) <cite id=\"33834270\">33834270</cite>. Cluster/phenogroup analyses that included frailty identified “very frail” phenotypes with markedly higher 6‑month risks of death or rehospitalization (HR ≈3.5) <cite id=\"37848804\">37848804</cite>.\n- Functional recovery: Objective measures of early physical performance after admission (e.g., walking speed in the first days) predict subsequent combined events (death/re‑admission) and reflect recovery potential—faster early walking speed was independently associated with lower combined event rates (adjusted HR per 0.1 m/s increase ≈0.95) <cite id=\"37672640\">37672640</cite>. Frail patients are more likely to be older, more comorbid and more dependent at baseline, and thus have worse functional recovery trajectories <cite id=\"36996756\">36996756</cite>.\n\nClinical implications and mitigation\n- Screening: Routine frailty and functional assessment at admission (e.g., Norton score, gait speed, FIM/SPPB) identifies patients at high short‑term risk and can guide care planning <cite id=\"32534818\">32534818</cite><cite id=\"37672640\">37672640</cite><cite id=\"33834270\">33834270</cite>.\n- Interventions: Multidisciplinary outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and targeted in‑hospital interventions (nutrition, early mobilization, geriatric co‑management) are plausible strategies to reduce adverse outcomes in frail HF patients; observational data link rehab participation with lower mortality and rehospitalization, and trials/protocols (nutritional support, telerehabilitation) are testing targeted approaches <cite id=\"32986957\">32986957</cite><cite id=\"33958128\">33958128</cite><cite id=\"37516829\">37516829</cite>.\n\nBottom line\n- Frailty at admission in older adults with ADHF is a strong, independent predictor of short‑term mortality and readmission and signals reduced potential for functional recovery. Early identification should prompt geriatric assessment and targeted interventions (nutrition, early mobilization/rehab, discharge planning) to try to improve short‑term outcomes.\n\nSelected citations\n- Norton score predicts 30‑day mortality and longer‑term outcomes <cite id=\"32534818\">32534818</cite>.\n- Early walking speed after admission predicts combined death/readmission (per 0.1 m/s) <cite id=\"37672640\">37672640</cite>.\n- Low FIM (functional dependence) associated with higher 180‑day death/readmission (adjusted HRs ≈2–3) <cite id=\"33834270\">33834270</cite>.\n- Frailty clusters linked to ~3–4× higher 6‑month poor outcomes <cite id=\"37848804\">37848804</cite>.\n- Frailty important predictor of mortality and rehospitalization in HFpEF cohorts <cite id=\"33667443\">33667443</cite>.\n- Observational data support benefit of multidisciplinary cardiac rehab; trials underway for targeted interventions (nutrition, telerehab) <cite id=\"32986957\">32986957</cite><cite id=\"33958128\">33958128</cite><cite id=\"37516829\">37516829</cite>.", "total_tool_calls": 2, "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "pmids_cited": ["33958128", "36996756", "33834270", "32534818", "37848804", "37672640", "37516829", "32986957", "33667443"]}, "metadata": {"expected_search_terms": ["frailty acute decompensated heart failure outcomes", "frailty predicts mortality readmission HF hospitalization older adults", "functional recovery frailty heart failure hospitalization", "frailty scores HF prognosis hospitalization"], "tools_used": ["pubmed_search"], "total_tool_calls": 2, "generation_time": "2025-12-20T15:27:38.888688"}}

However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2011.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity and HRQL in patients with CHD.To explore the potential study level predictors of the effectiveness of exercise-based CR in patients with CHD.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe updated searches from the previous Cochrane review, by searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2014) from December 2009 to July 2014. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and Science Citation Index Expanded (December 2009 to July 2014).\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months' follow-up, compared with a no exercise control. The study population comprised men and women of all ages who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or who have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We included RCTs that reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, MI, revascularisations, hospitalisations, health-related quality of life (HRQL), or costs.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently screened all identified references for inclusion based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. One author extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data. We stratified meta-analysis by the duration of follow up of trials, i.e. short-term: 6 to 12 months, medium-term: 13 to 36 months, and long-term: > 3 years.\nMAIN RESULTS\nThis review included 63 trials which randomised 14,486 people with CHD. This latest update identified 16 new trials (3872 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients and the mean age of patients within the trials ranged from 47.5 to 71.0 years. Women accounted for fewer than 15% of the patients recruited. Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality of reporting in more recent trials.As we found no significant difference in the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical outcomes across follow-up, we focused on reporting findings pooled across all trials at their longest follow-up (median 12 months). Exercise-based CR reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with no exercise control (27 trials; risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). There was no reduction in total mortality with CR (47 trials, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04). The overall risk of hospital admissions was reduced with CR (15 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) but there was no significant impact on the risk of MI (36 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04), CABG (29 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16) or PCI (18 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04).There was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity across trials for all event outcomes, and there was evidence of small study bias for MI and hospitalisation, but no other outcome. Predictors of clinical outcomes were examined across the longest follow-up of studies using univariate meta-regression. Results show that benefits in outcomes were independent of participants' CHD case mix (proportion of patients with MI), type of CR (exercise only vs comprehensive rehabilitation) dose of exercise, length of follow-up, trial publication date, setting (centre vs home-based), study location (continent), sample size or risk of bias.Given the heterogeneity in outcome measures and reporting methods, meta-analysis was not undertaken for HRQL. In five out of 20 trials reporting HRQL using validated measures, there was evidence of significant improvement in most or all of the sub-scales with exercise-based CR compared to control at follow-up. Four trial-based economic evaluation studies indicated exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years.The quality of the evidence for outcomes reported in the review was rated using the GRADE method. The quality of the evidence varied widely by outcome and ranged from low to moderate.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis updated Cochrane review supports the conclusions of the previous version of this review that, compared with no exercise control, exercise-based CR reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality but not total mortality. We saw a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation with CR but not in the risk of MI or revascularisation. We identified further evidence supporting improved HRQL with exercise-based CR. More recent trials were more likely to be well reported and include older and female patients. However, the population studied in this review still consists predominantly of lower risk individuals following MI or revascularisation. Further well conducted RCTs are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based CR in higher risk CHD groups and also those presenting with stable angina. These trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, explicitly report clinical event outcomes including mortality and hospital admissions, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38576163\">Title: Incidence and predictors of heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction after ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the contemporary era of early percutaneous coronary intervention.\nAuthors: Lenselink, Chris, Ricken, Kim W L M, Groot, Hilde E et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: European journal of heart failure\nAbstract: AIMS\nThe development and incidence of de-novo heart failure after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the contemporary era of rapid reperfusion are largely unknown. We aimed to establish the incidence of post-STEMI heart failure, stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and to find predictors for its occurrence. Furthermore, we investigated the course of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after STEMI.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nA total of 1172 all-comer STEMI patients from the CardioLines Biobank were included. Patients were predominantly male (74.5%) and 64 ± 12 years of age. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years (2.0, 5.5) we found a total incidence of post-STEMI heart failure of 10.9%, of which 52.1% heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), 29.4% heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and 18.5% heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Independent predictors for the development of HFrEF were male sex (β = 0.97, p = 0.009), lung crepitations (β = 1.09, p = 0.001), potassium level (mmol/L, β = 0.43, p = 0.012), neutrophil count (10 9 /L, β = 0.09, p = 0.001) and a reduced LVEF (β = 1.91, p < 0.001) at baseline. Independent predictors for the development of HFpEF were female sex (β = 0.99, p = 0.029), pre-existing kidney failure (β = 1.95, p = 0.003) and greater left atrial volume index (β = 0.04, p = 0.033) at baseline. Follow-up echocardiography (median follow-up 20 months) showed an improvement in LVEF (p < 0.001), whereas changes in diastolic function parameters showed both improvement and deterioration.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the current era of early STEMI reperfusion, still one in 10 patients develops heart failure, with approximately half of the patients with a reduced and half with a mildly reduced or normal LVEF. Predictors for the development of HFrEF were different from HFpEF.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34448003\">Title: Effect of dapagliflozin on ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death in DAPA-HF.\nAuthors: Curtain, James P, Docherty, Kieran F, Jhund, Pardeep S et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: European heart journal\nAbstract: AIMS\nThe aim of this study was to examine the effect of dapagliflozin on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nIn a post hoc analysis of DAPA-HF, we examined serious adverse event reports related to ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, in addition to adjudicated sudden death. The effect of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on the composite of the first occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. A serious ventricular arrhythmia was reported in 115 (2.4%) of the 4744 patients in DAPA-HF (ventricular fibrillation in 15 patients, ventricular tachycardia in 86, 'other' ventricular arrhythmia/tachyarrhythmia in 12, and torsade de pointes in 2 patients). A total of 206 (41%) of the 500 cardiovascular deaths occurred suddenly. Eight patients survived resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Independent predictors of the composite outcome (first occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest or sudden death), ranked by chi-square value, were log-transformed N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, history of ventricular arrhythmia, left ventricular ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, male sex, body mass index, serum sodium concentration, non-white race, treatment with dapagliflozin, and cardiac resynchronization therapy. Of participants assigned to dapagliflozin, 140/2373 patients (5.9%) experienced the composite outcome compared with 175/2371 patients (7.4%) in the placebo group [hazard ratio 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.99), P = 0.037], and the effect was consistent across each of the components of the composite outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDapagliflozin reduced the risk of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or sudden death when added to conventional therapy in patients with HFrEF.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov unique identifier: NCT03036124 (DAPA-HF).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34201267\">Title: A Long-Term Incidence of Heart Failure and Predictors Following Newly Developed Acute Myocardial Infarction: A 10 Years Retrospective Cohort Study with Korean National Health Insurance Data.\nAuthors: Choi, Hyojung, Seo, Joo Yeon, Shin, Jinho et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: International journal of environmental research and public health\nAbstract: Heart failure (HF) is the major mechanism of mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during early or intermediate post-AMI period. But heart failure is one of the most common long-term complications of AMI. Applied the retrospective cohort study design with nation representative population data, this study traced the incidence of late-onset heart failure since 1 year after newly developed acute myocardial infarction and assessed its risk factors. Methods and Results: Using the Korea National Health Insurance database, 18,328 newly developed AMI patients aged 40 years or older and first hospitalized in 2010 for 3 days or more, were set up as baseline cohort (12,403). The incidence rate of AMI per 100,000 persons was 79.8 overall, and 49.6 for women and 112.3 for men. A total of 2010 (1073 men, 937 women) were newly developed with HF during 6 years following post AMI. Cumulative incidences of HF per 1000 AMI patients for a year at each time period were 37.4 in initial hospitalization, 32.3 in 1 year after discharge, and 8.9 in 1-6 years. The overall and age-specific incidence rates of HF were higher in women than men. For late-onset HF, female, medical aid, pre-existing hypertension, severity of AMI, duration of hospital stay during index admission, reperfusion treatment, and drug prescription pattern including diuretics, affected the occurrence of late-onset HF. Conclusion: With respect to late-onset HF following AMI, appropriate management including hypertension and medical aid program in addition to quality improvement of AMI treatment are required to reduce the risk of late-onset heart failure.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>The initial PubMed hits include one directly on post-STEMI HF incidence/predictors, but to answer “post-MI populations” more generally (including historical cohorts and larger MI registries/trials) I should add targeted PubMed searches for (1) post-MI HF incidence over longer horizons and (2) prognostic baseline predictors (e.g., LVEF, Killip class, infarct size biomarkers, age, diabetes, renal function).

The magnitude of this risk with the advent of primary percutaneous coronary intervention is less characterized. We aimed to examine the incidence and predictors of incident HF and all-cause mortality in a contemporary STEMI cohort. We performed a retrospective analysis of 700 consecutive patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention at a tertiary hospital. The primary outcome was the occurrence of HF during follow-up. HF was defined by HF hospitalization or the presence of congestion that led to de novo prescription or up-titration of diuretics in the outpatient clinic. The secondary outcome was defined by the occurrence of HF or all-cause mortality. During a median follow-up period of 43.6 months, HF events occurred in 110 patients (15.7%), 34 (4.8%) managed as outpatient and 76 (10.9%) requiring hospitalization. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% was present in 76% of those who developed HF. Age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.06), diabetes (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.05), door-to-balloon time (HR 1.002, 95% CI 1.000 to 1.003), Killip-Kimball class ≥II (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.80) and LVEF <50% (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.92) were independent predictors. All-cause mortality incidence was 8.7%. HF was independently associated with a threefold increased risk of dying (HR 3.52, 95% CI 1.85 to 6.69, p <0.001). In conclusion, a substantial proportion of contemporary patients with STEMI develop HF, which triplicates the risk of dying. Older age, diabetes and LVEF <50% independently predicted the development of HF and all-cause death.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36295071\">Title: Left Ventricular Remodeling and Heart Failure Predictors in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients with Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction after Successful Percutaneous Intervention in Western Romania.\nAuthors: Arnautu, Diana-Aurora, Andor, Minodora, Buz, Bogdan-Flaviu et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Life (Basel, Switzerland)\nAbstract: (1) Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients are at risk of left ventricular (LV) remodeling and heart failure (HF), even after successful revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We wanted to assess the independent predictors of these outcomes in AMI patients. (2) Methods: The study enrolled patients with a LVEF ≥50% after a successful PCI for their first AMI. After 24 months, patients were separated into two groups based on whether their LVEF remained ≥50% (group I), or decreased to <50% (group II). (3) Outcomes: 26% of the patients experienced a decrease in LVEF below 50%, 41% showed LV remodeling, and 8% had experienced HF hospitalizations. HF hospitalizations were significantly more frequent in group II patients (p < 0.0001). The Killip class at admission >2, infarct-related longitudinal strain ≤−12.5%, and the presence of LV remodeling were identified as independent predictors of HF hospitalizations. (4) Conclusions: About 26% of AMI patients with normal LV function after a successful PCI developed HF. More sensitive techniques are required that allow for a more efficient risk-stratification and preventive therapy to reduce LV remodeling and HF in AMI patients with LVEF ≥50% after a successful PCI. The detection of abnormal ventricular deformation patterns after PCI by speckle-tracking echocardiography might be a valuable method in this approach.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37396907\">Title: Predictors for early cardiac death after discharge from successfully treated acute myocardial infarction.\nAuthors: Choi, Young, Lee, Kwan Yong, Kim, Sang Hyun et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Frontiers in medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe use of a cardioverter defibrillator for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death is not recommended within 40 days after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated the predictors for early cardiac death among patients who were admitted for AMI and successfully discharged.\nMETHODS\nConsecutive patients with AMI were enrolled in a multicenter prospective registry. Among 10,719 patients with AMI, 554 patients with in-hospital death and 62 patients with early non-cardiac death were excluded. Early cardiac death was defined as a cardiac death within 90 days after index AMI.\nRESULTS\nEarly cardiac death after discharge occurred in 168/10,103 (1.7%) patients. A defibrillator was not implanted in all patients with early cardiac death. Killip class ≥3, chronic kidney disease stage ≥4, severe anemia, cardiopulmonary support usage, no dual antiplatelet therapy at discharge, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35% were independent predictors for early cardiac death. The incidence of early cardiac death according to the number of factors added to LVEF criteria in each patient was 3.03% for 0 factor, 8.11% for 1 factor, and 9.16% for ≥2 factors. Each model that sequentially added the factors in the presence of LVEF criteria showed a significant gradual increase in predictive accuracy and an improvement in reclassification capability. A model with all factors showed C-index 0.742 [95% CI 0.702-0.781], p < 0.001; IDI 0.024 [95% CI 0.015-0.033], p < 0.001; and NRI 0.644 [95% CI 0.492-0.795], p < 0.001.\nCONCLUSION\nWe identified six predictors for early cardiac death after discharge from AMI. These predictors would help to discriminate high-risk patients over current LVEF criteria and to provide an individualized therapeutic approach in the subacute stage of AMI.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31296912\">Title: Independent Predictors of Cardiac Mortality and Hospitalization for Heart Failure in a Multi-Ethnic Asian ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Population Treated by Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.\nAuthors: Bulluck, Heerajnarain, Zheng, Huili, Chan, Mark Y et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Scientific reports\nAbstract: We aimed to identify independent predictors of cardiac mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) from a real-world, multi-ethnic Asian registry [the Singapore Myocardial Infarction Registry] of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. 11,546 eligible STEMI patients between 2008 and 2015 were identified. In-hospital, 30-day and 1-year cardiac mortality and 1-year HHF rates were 6.4%, 6.8%, 8.3% and 5.2%, respectively. From the derivation cohort (70% of patients), age, Killip class and cardiac arrest, creatinine, hemoglobin and troponin on admission and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during hospitalization were predictors of in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year cardiac mortality. Previous ischemic heart disease (IHD) was a predictor of in-hospital and 30-day cardiac mortality only, whereas diabetes was a predictor of 1-year cardiac mortality only. Age, previous IHD and diabetes, Killip class, creatinine, hemoglobin and troponin on admission, symptom-to-balloon-time and LVEF were predictors of 1-year HHF. The c-statistics were 0.921, 0.901, 0.881, 0.869, respectively. Applying these models to the validation cohort (30% of patients) showed good fit and discrimination (c-statistic 0.922, 0.913, 0.903 and 0.855 respectively; misclassification rate 14.0%, 14.7%, 16.2% and 24.0% respectively). These predictors could be incorporated into specific risk scores to stratify reperfused STEMI patients by their risk level for targeted intervention.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39902089\">Title: Interrelation between hypoxic liver injury and Killip classification in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients.\nAuthors: Choi, Seong Huan, Jang, Ji-Hun, Kim, Dae-Young et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nHypoxic liver injury (HLI) and Killip classification are poor prognostic factors in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This study investigates the interrelationship between hypoxic liver injury (HLI) and Killip classification.\nMETHOD AND RESULTS\nA total of 1,537 STEMI patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from 2007 to 2014 at four tertiary hospitals in the Incheon-Bucheon province were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into four groups based on their Killip classification at presentation in the emergency room (ER). HLI was defined as a ≥2-fold increase in serum aspartate transaminase (AST). The incidence of HLI showed incremental tendency with respect to the Killip classification (19.5%, 19.4%, 34.6%, and 37.8%, respectively; p < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was below 45% in symptomatic, overt heart failure patients (Killip class II, III, and IV). Both initial and peak AST levels increased in accordance with Killip classification along with cardiac biomarkers. In-hospital mortality was directly related to Killip classification (2.3%, 7.3%, 16.3%, 29.2%) with statistical significance. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of HLI and combined Killip classification III and IV were poor prognostic factors, even after adjusting for conventional clinical risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that combination of HLI and Killip classification was the most sensitive predictor of mortality (AUC 0.832, 95% CI 0.78-0.882). Kaplan-Meier curve showed that patients with HLI and Killip class (III and IV) had the lowest event-free survival regarding in-hospital mortality and major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe presence of HLI and Killip classification were directly related to worse prognosis in STEMI patients. Early recognition of HLI and accurate assessment of Killip classification is warranted for effective management of STEMI.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">VALIANT trial postinfarction heart failure predictors</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 0 results.

Conversely, since the severity of MI is declining over time, a decline in post-MI heart failure might also be anticipated. This study tested the hypothesis that the incidence of post-MI heart failure was declining over time in a geographically defined MI incidence cohort. Between 1979 and 1994, 1,537 patients with incident MI and no prior history of heart failure were hospitalized in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Framingham Heart Study criteria were used to ascertain the incidence of inpatient and outpatient heart failure over a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years (standard deviation 5.5). Overall, 36% of patients experienced heart failure. After adjustment for factors related to post-MI heart failure (age, hypertension, smoking, and biomarkers), the incidence of heart failure declined by 2% per year (relative risk = 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 0.99; p = 0.01). The relative risk of developing heart failure among persons with MIs occurring in 1994 versus 1979 was 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.55, 0.93), indicating a 28% reduction in the incidence of heart failure. Administration of reperfusion therapy within 24 hours after MI was associated with lower risk of post-MI heart failure and accounted for most of the temporal decline in heart failure. This suggests that improved survival after MI is unlikely to be a major contributor to the heart failure epidemic.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27437886\">Title: Atherosclerotic Burden and Heart Failure After Myocardial Infarction.\nAuthors: Gerber, Yariv, Weston, Susan A, Enriquez-Sarano, Maurice et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: JAMA cardiology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nWhether the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with the occurrence of heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI) is not known. Furthermore, whether this association might differ by HF type according to preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF) has yet to be determined.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate in a community cohort of patients with incident (first-ever) MI the association of angiographic CAD with subsequent HF and to examine the prognostic role of CAD according to HF subtypes: HF with reduced EF and HF with preserved EF.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA population-based cohort study was conducted in 1922 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, with incident MI diagnosed between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010, and no prior HF; study participants were followed up through March 31, 2013. The extent of angiographic CAD was determined at baseline and categorized according to the number of major epicardial coronary arteries with 50% or more lumen diameter obstruction.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was time to incident HF. The primary exposure variable was the extent of CAD as expressed by the number of major coronary arteries with significant obstruction (0-, 1-, 2-, or 3-vessel disease) obtained from coronary angiograms performed no more than 1 day after the MI. Heart failure was ascertained by the Framingham criteria and classified by type according to EF (50% cutoff).\nRESULTS\nOf the 1922 participants, 1258 (65.4%) were men (mean [SD] age, 64 [13] years). During a mean follow-up period of 6.7 (5.9) years, 588 patients (30.6%) developed HF. With death and recurrent MI modeled as competing risks, the cumulative incidence rates of post-MI HF among patients with 0 or 1, 2, and 3 diseased vessels were 10.7%, 14.6%, and 23.0% at 30 days; and 14.7%, 20.6%, and 29.8% at 5 years, respectively (P < .001 for trend). After adjustment for clinical characteristics in a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) for HF were 1.25 (0.99-1.59) and 1.75 (1.40-2.20) in patients with 2 and 3 vessels vs 0 or 1 occluded vessel, respectively (P < .001 for trend). The increased risk with a greater number of occluded vessels was independent of the occurrence of a recurrent MI and did not differ appreciably by HF type.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe extent of angiographic CAD is an indicator of post-MI HF regardless of HF type and independent of recurrent MI. These data underscore the need to further investigate the processes taking place in the transition from myocardial injury to HF.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"26699392\">Title: Mortality Associated With Heart Failure After Myocardial Infarction: A Contemporary Community Perspective.\nAuthors: Gerber, Yariv, Weston, Susan A, Enriquez-Sarano, Maurice et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Circulation. Heart failure\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nContemporary data are lacking on the prognostic importance of heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI). We evaluated the prognostic impact of HF post MI according to preserved/reduced ejection fraction and the timing of its occurrence.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nAll Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents (n=2596) with incident MI diagnosed in 1990 to 2010 and no prior HF were followed through March 2013. Cox models were used to examine (1) the hazard ratios for death associated with HF type and timing and (2) secular trends in survival by HF status. During a mean follow-up of 7.6 years, there were 1116 deaths, 634 in the 902 patients who developed HF (70%) and 482 in the 1694 patients who did not develop HF (28%). After adjustment for age and sex, HF as a time-dependent variable was strongly associated with mortality (hazard ratio =3.31, 95% confidence interval: 2.93-3.75), particularly from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio =4.20, 95% confidence interval: 3.50-5.03). Further adjustment for MI severity and comorbidity, acute treatment, and recurrent MI moderately attenuated these associations (hazard ratio =2.49 and 2.94 for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively). Mortality did not differ by ejection fraction, but was higher for delayed- versus early-onset HF (P for heterogeneity =0.002). The age- and sex-adjusted 5-year survival estimates in 2001 to 2010 versus 1990 to 2000 were 82% and 81% among HF-free and 61% and 54% among HF patients, respectively (P for heterogeneity of trends =0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS\nHF markedly increases the risk of death after MI. This excess risk is similar regardless of ejection fraction but greater for delayed- versus early-onset HF. Mortality after MI declined over time, primarily as a result of improved HF survival.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29702298\">Title: Increased Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction and Heart Failure in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.\nAuthors: Aniwan, Satimai, Pardi, Darrell S, Tremaine, William J et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association\nAbstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThere are conflicting data as to whether inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) increase risk for cardiovascular disease. We sought to examine the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure in patients with IBD.\nMETHODS\nWe identified patients diagnosed with IBD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1980 through 2010 (n = 736). For each patient, 2 individuals without IBD (controls, n = 1472) were randomly selected, matched for age, sex, and index date of disease diagnosis. Primary outcomes were AMI and heart failure. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the risk of AMI and heart failure.\nRESULTS\nAfter adjustments for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, IBD associated independently with increased risk of AMI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.82; 95% CI, 1.98-4.04) and heart failure (aHR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.36-3.03). The relative risk of AMI was significantly increased in patients with Crohn's disease (aHR vs controls, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.65-5.13) or ulcerative colitis (aHR vs controls, 2.70; 1.69-4.35). The relative risk of AMI was increased among users of systemic corticosteroids (aHR vs controls, 5.08; 95% CI, 3.00-8.81) and nonusers (aHR vs controls, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08-2.98). The relative risk of heart failure was significantly increased among patients with ulcerative colitis (aHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.18-3.65), but not Crohn's disease. The relative risk of heart failure was increased among users of systemic corticosteroids (aHR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.93-4.57), but not nonusers.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a population-based cohort study, we found that despite a lower prevalence of traditional risk factors for AMI and heart failure, patients with IBD are at increased risk for these cardiovascular disorders.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27417004\">Title: Heart Failure After Myocardial Infarction Is Associated With Increased Risk of Cancer.\nAuthors: Hasin, Tal, Gerber, Yariv, Weston, Susan A et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Journal of the American College of Cardiology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nHeart failure (HF) is associated with excess morbidity and mortality for which noncardiac causes are increasingly recognized. The authors previously described an increased risk of cancer among HF patients compared with community controls.\nOBJECTIVES\nThis study examined whether HF was associated with an increased risk of subsequent cancer among a homogenous population of first myocardial infarction (MI) survivors.\nMETHODS\nA prospective cohort study was conducted among Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with incident MI from 2002 to 2010. Patients with prior cancer or HF diagnoses were excluded.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1,081 participants (mean age 64 ± 15 years; 60% male) were followed for 5,327 person-years (mean 4.9 ± 3.0 years). A total of 228 patients developed HF, and 98 patients developed cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). Incidence density rates for cancer diagnosis (per 1,000 person-years) were 33.7 for patients with HF and 15.6 for patients without HF (p = 0.002). The hazard ratio (HR) for cancer associated with HF was 2.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39 to 3.35); adjusted for age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index; HR: 1.71 (95% CI: 1.07 to 2.73). The HRs for mortality associated with cancer were 4.90 (95% CI: 3.10 to 7.74) for HF-free and 3.91 (95% CI: 1.88 to 8.12) for HF patients (p for interaction = 0.76).\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients who develop HF after MI have an increased risk of cancer. This finding extends our previous report of an elevated cancer risk after HF compared with controls, and calls for a better understanding of shared risk factors and underlying mechanisms.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">SWEDEHEART myocardial infarction heart failure incidence</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 51 results.

The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, encompassing both in-hospital and long-term mortality; the secondary endpoints included myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, new revascularization, and heart failure. Multilevel logistic regression with follow-up time as a log-transformed offset variable and double-robust adjustment with the instrumental variable method were applied to control for known and unknown confounders.\nRESULTS\nPercutaneous coronary intervention was the primary therapy in 42 190 (73.9%) patients, while 14 907 (26.1%) received CABG. Percutaneous coronary intervention patients were generally older with more prior cardiovascular events, whereas CABG patients had higher incidences of diabetes, hypertension, left main and three-vessel disease, and reduced ejection fraction. Over a median follow-up of 7.1 years, PCI was associated with higher risks of death [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-1.81] and MI (aOR 1.51; 95% CI 1.41-1.62) but there was no significant difference in stroke. Repeat revascularization was three times more likely to PCI (aOR 3.01; 95% CI 2.57-3.51), while heart failure risk was 15% higher (aOR 1.15; 95% CI 1.07-1.25). Coronary artery bypass grafting provided longer survival within 15 years, especially in patients under 70 years of age, with left main disease or left ventricular dysfunction, though this benefit diminished over shorter time horizons.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCoronary artery bypass grafting is associated with lower risks of mortality, MI, repeat revascularization, and heart failure in patients with NSTEMI, particularly in high-risk subgroups. However, its survival benefit lessens with shorter life expectancy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28844200\">Title: Oxygen Therapy in Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction.\nAuthors: Hofmann, Robin, James, Stefan K, Jernberg, Tomas et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe clinical effect of routine oxygen therapy in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction who do not have hypoxemia at baseline is uncertain.\nMETHODS\nIn this registry-based randomized clinical trial, we used nationwide Swedish registries for patient enrollment and data collection. Patients with suspected myocardial infarction and an oxygen saturation of 90% or higher were randomly assigned to receive either supplemental oxygen (6 liters per minute for 6 to 12 hours, delivered through an open face mask) or ambient air.\nRESULTS\nA total of 6629 patients were enrolled. The median duration of oxygen therapy was 11.6 hours, and the median oxygen saturation at the end of the treatment period was 99% among patients assigned to oxygen and 97% among patients assigned to ambient air. Hypoxemia developed in 62 patients (1.9%) in the oxygen group, as compared with 254 patients (7.7%) in the ambient-air group. The median of the highest troponin level during hospitalization was 946.5 ng per liter in the oxygen group and 983.0 ng per liter in the ambient-air group. The primary end point of death from any cause within 1 year after randomization occurred in 5.0% of patients (166 of 3311) assigned to oxygen and in 5.1% of patients (168 of 3318) assigned to ambient air (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.21; P=0.80). Rehospitalization with myocardial infarction within 1 year occurred in 126 patients (3.8%) assigned to oxygen and in 111 patients (3.3%) assigned to ambient air (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.46; P=0.33). The results were consistent across all predefined subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS\nRoutine use of supplemental oxygen in patients with suspected myocardial infarction who did not have hypoxemia was not found to reduce 1-year all-cause mortality.

We explored the complication rates of heart failure and death after acute myocardial infarction in patients with and without diabetes.\nMETHODS\nAll patients ( N = 73,959) with acute myocardial infarction admitted for coronary angiography included in the SWEDEHEART registry during the years 2012-2017 were followed for heart failure (until 31 December 2017) and mortality (until 30 June 2018); mean follow-up time 1223 (SD ± 623) days.\nRESULTS\nMean age was 69 years (SD ± 12), 69% were male and 24% had diabetes. Heart failure occurred more often in diabetes (22% vs . 12% if no diabetes), especially if previous MI (33% vs. 23%). Patients with diabetes had increased risk of HF regardless of previous myocardial infarction (MI); with previous MI adjusted hazard ratio 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.96-2.20) and without MI 1.52 (1.44-1.61) respectively when non-diabetes patients with first MI served as reference. In patients with no previous heart failure or MI and discharged with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50% the risk of heart failure was particularly high in those with diabetes (1.56; 1.39-1.76) when compared with those without. Similar findings were seen for death and combined event (heart failure and death).\nCONCLUSIONS\nHeart failure is a common complication after acute myocardial infarction in diabetes, increasing the risk by 50-60% regardless of previous heart failure or MI. This risk is present even with normal reported left ventricular ejection fraction, indicating the existence of a large diabetes population at heart failure risk after acute myocardial infarction.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25742760\">Title: Incidence, temporal trends, and prognostic impact of heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction.

Heart failure\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nThe aim of this study was to examine temporal trends in the incidence and outcomes of heart failure (HF) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a large national cohort.\nBACKGROUND\nThere are limited and conflicting data concerning temporal trends in the incidence and prognostic implication of in-hospital HF that complicates AMI.\nMETHODS\nThe nationwide coronary care unit registry SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) records baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcome of consecutive patients with AMIs admitted to all hospitals in Sweden. The diagnosis of HF requires the presence of crackles (Killip class ≥II) or the use of intravenous diuretic agents or intravenous inotropes. This study included 199,851 patients admitted for index AMIs between 1996 and 2008.\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of HF declined from 46% to 28% (p < 0.001). This decrease was more pronounced in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions and left bundle branch block (from 50% to 28%) compared with those with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (from 42% to 28%) (p < 0.001). The in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates for patients who developed HF during the index myocardial infarction decreased over the years from 19% to 13%, from 23% to 17%, and from 36% to 31%, respectively (p < 0.001 for all). Thirteen-year survival analysis showed higher mortality in patients with HF compared with those without HF (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.1; 95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 2.13).\nCONCLUSIONS\nA marked decrease was found in the incidence of HF complicating AMI between 1996 and 2008. However, HF continues to worsen the early-, intermediate-, and long-term adverse prognostic risk after AMI.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34952674\">Title: Development and validation of an artificial neural network algorithm to predict mortality and admission to hospital for heart failure after myocardial infarction: a nationwide population-based study.\nAuthors: Mohammad, Moman A, Olesen, Kevin K W, Koul, Sasha et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: The Lancet. Digital health\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nPatients have an estimated mortality of 15-20% within the first year following myocardial infarction and one in four patients who survive myocardial infarction will develop heart failure, severely reducing quality of life and increasing the risk of long-term mortality. We aimed to establish the accuracy of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm in predicting 1-year mortality and admission to hospital for heart failure after myocardial infarction.\nMETHODS\nIn this nationwide population-based study, we used data for all patients admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction and discharged alive from a coronary care unit in Sweden (n=139 288) between Jan 1, 2008, and April 1, 2017, from the Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) nationwide registry; these patients were randomly divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. We developed an ANN using 21 variables (including age, sex, medical history, previous medications, in-hospital characteristics, and discharge medications) associated with the outcomes of interest with a back-propagation algorithm in the training dataset and tested it in the testing dataset. The ANN algorithm was then validated in patients with incident myocardial infarction enrolled in the Western Denmark Heart Registry (external validation cohort) between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2016. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Youden's index was established as a means of identifying an empirical dichotomous cutoff, allowing further evaluation of model performance.\nFINDINGS\n139 288 patients who were admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction in the SWEDEHEART registry were randomly divided into a training dataset of 111 558 (80%) patients and a testing dataset of 27 730 (20%) patients. 30 971 patients with myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Western Denmark Heart Registry were included in the external validation cohort. A first event, either all-cause mortality or admission to hospital for heart failure 1 year after myocardial infarction, occurred in 32 308 (23·2%) patients in the testing and training cohorts only. For 1-year all-cause mortality, the ANN had an AUROC of 0·85 (95% CI 0·84-0·85) in the testing dataset and 0·84 (0·83-0·84) in the external validation cohort. The AUROC for admission to hospital for heart failure within 1 year was 0·82 (0·81-0·82) in the testing dataset and 0·78 (0·77-0·79) in the external validation dataset. With an empirical cutoff the ANN algorithm correctly classified 73·6% of patients with regard to all-cause mortality and 61·5% of patients with regard to admission to hospital for heart failure in the external validation cohort, ruling out adverse outcomes with 97·1-98·7% probability in the external validation cohort.\nINTERPRETATION\nIdentifying patients at a high risk of developing heart failure or death after myocardial infarction could result in tailored therapies and monitoring by the allocation of resources to those at greatest risk.\nFUNDING\nThe Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, Swedish Scientific Research Council, Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, ALF Agreement on Medical Education and Research, Skane University Hospital, The Bundy Academy, the Märta Winkler Foundation, the Anna-Lisa and Sven-Eric Lundgren Foundation for Medical Research.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n- (finish Lenselink item) — Lenselink et al. also showed that post-STEMI incident HF cases were a mix of EF phenotypes (roughly half HFrEF, remainder HFmrEF/HFpEF), highlighting that post-MI HF is not exclusively reduced‑EF disease. <cite id=\"38576163\">Lenselink et al.</cite>\n\nSynthesis — longer-term trajectory and key determinants\n- Cumulative incidence continues to accrue for years after the index MI (rates reported in the literature range widely because of differences in era, case‑mix and outcome definitions), with the bulk of excess HF risk concentrated among older patients, those with larger infarcts or more impaired LV function at baseline, and those with greater chronic comorbidity burden. Several population and registry studies demonstrate that contemporary reperfusion and secondary‑prevention therapies have reduced early HF complicating MI over recent decades but that meaningful residual risk persists in higher‑risk subgroups. <cite id=\"25742760\">Desta/SWEDEHEART</cite> <cite id=\"27437886\">Gerber et al.</cite> <cite id=\"31296912\">Bulluck et al.</cite>\n\nPredictors that most strongly and consistently predict progression to HF after MI\n- Baseline left ventricular systolic dysfunction (reduced LVEF)\n  - The single strongest and most consistent predictor across cohorts. Lower LVEF measured early after MI is tightly linked to subsequent HF events and mortality; many studies show graded risk as EF declines. <cite id=\"38576163\">Lenselink et al.</cite>\n- Clinical severity at presentation (Killip class / signs of heart failure on index admission)\n  - Higher Killip class or evidence of pulmonary congestion during the index hospitalization predicts both early and later HF. Temporal declines in in‑hospital HF incidence paralleled improvements in acute care. <cite id=\"25742760\">Desta/SWEDEHEART</cite>\n- Infarct burden / ischemic substrate (anatomic and biomarker markers)\n  - Multivessel CAD and larger infarct size (by biomarker peak or imaging) confer higher HF risk. Angiographic disease extent was associated with substantially higher early HF in community cohorts. <cite id=\"27437886\">Gerber et al.</cite>\n- Older age\n  - Age is an independent and powerful predictor of incident HF after MI in virtually every cohort; older patients have higher competing comorbidity and less myocardial reserve. <cite id=\"27437886\">Gerber et al.</cite>\n- Prior heart failure or prior MI / baseline cardiac structural disease\n  - A history of HF or prior infarction greatly increases the likelihood of further HF progression after a new MI. <cite id=\"27437886\">Gerber et al.</cite>\n- Diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease\n  - Metabolic and renal comorbidities independently increase HF risk post‑MI and are commonly overrepresented among those who develop HF. <cite id=\"31296912\">Bulluck et al.</cite>\n- Atrial fibrillation and other concurrent cardiac conditions\n  - Baseline AF or other conduction/arrhythmia disorders predict worse remodeling and higher HF incidence.\n- Incomplete or delayed reperfusion and absence of guideline‑directed therapies\n  - Contemporary reperfusion (primary PCI) and early medical therapy lower HF risk; conversely, late/no reperfusion and underuse of ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta‑blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists are associated with higher progression to HF. Improvements in reperfusion era partly explain secular declines in in‑hospital HF. <cite id=\"25742760\">Desta/SWEDEHEART</cite> <cite id=\"31296912\">Bulluck et al.</cite>\n\nHow these predictors are used clinically\n- Early risk stratification should focus on LVEF measurement, Killip class, assessment of infarct size/ischaemic burden and comorbidity profiling (age, diabetes, CKD, prior HF). Patients with reduced EF, higher Killip class, large infarct or multimorbidity merit intensified surveillance (BNP/NT‑proBNP, repeat imaging), prompt initiation and uptitration of guideline‑directed therapies, and consideration of advanced heart‑failure prevention strategies (structured follow‑up, cardiac rehabilitation, device evaluation where indicated). <cite id=\"38576163\">Lenselink et al.</cite> <cite id=\"27437886\">Gerber et al.</cite>\n\nRemaining gaps and research directions\n- Heterogeneity in outcome definitions (clinical HF vs HF hospitalization vs imaging‑defined dysfunction), evolving reperfusion and medical therapy, and varying cohort case‑mix limit direct comparison of absolute incidence estimates across studies. Better predictive tools that integrate imaging (including infarct characterization), biomarkers, and clinical variables to discriminate HF phenotypes (HFrEF vs HFpEF) after MI are needed to guide personalized prevention strategies. Longitudinal studies in contemporary reperfusion-era populations and validation of risk scores for actionable thresholds remain priorities.\n\nBottom line\n- Incidence of HF after MI accumulates over months and years and is highly variable by study era and population, but the dominant determinants of progression are baseline myocardial injury/ventricular dysfunction (LVEF, infarct size), clinical severity at presentation (Killip class), age and comorbidity (especially diabetes and CKD). These factors should guide early risk stratification, targeted surveillance and aggressive application of evidence‑based therapies to reduce the long‑term burden of post‑MI heart failure. <cite id=\"25742760\">Desta et al.</cite> <cite id=\"27437886\">Gerber et al.</cite> <cite id=\"31296912\">Bulluck et al.</cite> <cite id=\"38576163\">Lenselink et al.</cite>\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "post myocardial infarction heart failure incidence predictors", "result": {"total": 413, "data": [{"paperId": "27885969", "title": "36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine : Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016.", "abstract": "P001 - Sepsis impairs the capillary response within hypoxic capillaries and decreases erythrocyte oxygen-dependent ATP efflux R.

However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2011.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity and HRQL in patients with CHD.To explore the potential study level predictors of the effectiveness of exercise-based CR in patients with CHD.\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe updated searches from the previous Cochrane review, by searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2014) from December 2009 to July 2014. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and Science Citation Index Expanded (December 2009 to July 2014).\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months' follow-up, compared with a no exercise control. The study population comprised men and women of all ages who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or who have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We included RCTs that reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, MI, revascularisations, hospitalisations, health-related quality of life (HRQL), or costs.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently screened all identified references for inclusion based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. One author extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data. We stratified meta-analysis by the duration of follow up of trials, i.e. short-term: 6 to 12 months, medium-term: 13 to 36 months, and long-term: > 3 years.\nMAIN RESULTS\nThis review included 63 trials which randomised 14,486 people with CHD. This latest update identified 16 new trials (3872 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients and the mean age of patients within the trials ranged from 47.5 to 71.0 years. Women accounted for fewer than 15% of the patients recruited. Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality of reporting in more recent trials.As we found no significant difference in the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical outcomes across follow-up, we focused on reporting findings pooled across all trials at their longest follow-up (median 12 months). Exercise-based CR reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with no exercise control (27 trials; risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). There was no reduction in total mortality with CR (47 trials, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04). The overall risk of hospital admissions was reduced with CR (15 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) but there was no significant impact on the risk of MI (36 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04), CABG (29 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16) or PCI (18 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04).There was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity across trials for all event outcomes, and there was evidence of small study bias for MI and hospitalisation, but no other outcome. Predictors of clinical outcomes were examined across the longest follow-up of studies using univariate meta-regression. Results show that benefits in outcomes were independent of participants' CHD case mix (proportion of patients with MI), type of CR (exercise only vs comprehensive rehabilitation) dose of exercise, length of follow-up, trial publication date, setting (centre vs home-based), study location (continent), sample size or risk of bias.Given the heterogeneity in outcome measures and reporting methods, meta-analysis was not undertaken for HRQL. In five out of 20 trials reporting HRQL using validated measures, there was evidence of significant improvement in most or all of the sub-scales with exercise-based CR compared to control at follow-up. Four trial-based economic evaluation studies indicated exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years.The quality of the evidence for outcomes reported in the review was rated using the GRADE method. The quality of the evidence varied widely by outcome and ranged from low to moderate.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis updated Cochrane review supports the conclusions of the previous version of this review that, compared with no exercise control, exercise-based CR reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality but not total mortality. We saw a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation with CR but not in the risk of MI or revascularisation. We identified further evidence supporting improved HRQL with exercise-based CR. More recent trials were more likely to be well reported and include older and female patients. However, the population studied in this review still consists predominantly of lower risk individuals following MI or revascularisation. Further well conducted RCTs are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based CR in higher risk CHD groups and also those presenting with stable angina. These trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, explicitly report clinical event outcomes including mortality and hospital admissions, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.", "year": "2016", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}, {"paperId": "38576163", "title": "Incidence and predictors of heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction after ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the contemporary era of early percutaneous coronary intervention.", "abstract": "AIMS\nThe development and incidence of de-novo heart failure after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the contemporary era of rapid reperfusion are largely unknown. We aimed to establish the incidence of post-STEMI heart failure, stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and to find predictors for its occurrence. Furthermore, we investigated the course of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after STEMI.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nA total of 1172 all-comer STEMI patients from the CardioLines Biobank were included. Patients were predominantly male (74.5%) and 64 ± 12 years of age. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years (2.0, 5.5) we found a total incidence of post-STEMI heart failure of 10.9%, of which 52.1% heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), 29.4% heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and 18.5% heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Independent predictors for the development of HFrEF were male sex (β = 0.97, p = 0.009), lung crepitations (β = 1.09, p = 0.001), potassium level (mmol/L, β = 0.43, p = 0.012), neutrophil count (10 9 /L, β = 0.09, p = 0.001) and a reduced LVEF (β = 1.91, p < 0.001) at baseline. Independent predictors for the development of HFpEF were female sex (β = 0.99, p = 0.029), pre-existing kidney failure (β = 1.95, p = 0.003) and greater left atrial volume index (β = 0.04, p = 0.033) at baseline. Follow-up echocardiography (median follow-up 20 months) showed an improvement in LVEF (p < 0.001), whereas changes in diastolic function parameters showed both improvement and deterioration.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the current era of early STEMI reperfusion, still one in 10 patients develops heart failure, with approximately half of the patients with a reduced and half with a mildly reduced or normal LVEF.

The patients were divided into four groups based on their Killip classification at presentation in the emergency room (ER). HLI was defined as a ≥2-fold increase in serum aspartate transaminase (AST). The incidence of HLI showed incremental tendency with respect to the Killip classification (19.5%, 19.4%, 34.6%, and 37.8%, respectively; p < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was below 45% in symptomatic, overt heart failure patients (Killip class II, III, and IV). Both initial and peak AST levels increased in accordance with Killip classification along with cardiac biomarkers. In-hospital mortality was directly related to Killip classification (2.3%, 7.3%, 16.3%, 29.2%) with statistical significance. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of HLI and combined Killip classification III and IV were poor prognostic factors, even after adjusting for conventional clinical risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that combination of HLI and Killip classification was the most sensitive predictor of mortality (AUC 0.832, 95% CI 0.78-0.882).

While medical management focuses mostly on symptomatic treatment, decades of research have resulted in first therapeutics able to restore the affected reading frame of dystrophin transcripts or induce synthesis of a truncated dystrophin protein from a vector, with other strategies based on gene therapy and cell signaling in preclinical or clinical development. Nevertheless, recent reports show that potentially therapeutic dystrophins can be immunogenic in patients. This raises the question of whether a dystrophin paralog, utrophin, could be a more suitable therapeutic protein. Here, we compare dystrophin and utrophin amino acid sequences and structures, combining published data with our extended in silico analyses. We then discuss these results in the context of therapeutic approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Specifically, we focus on strategies based on delivery of micro-dystrophin and micro-utrophin genes with recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, exon skipping of the mutated dystrophin pre-mRNAs, reading through termination codons with small molecules that mask premature stop codons, dystrophin gene repair by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated genetic engineering, and increasing utrophin levels. Our analyses highlight the importance of various dystrophin and utrophin domains in Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment, providing insights into designing novel therapeutic compounds with improved efficacy and decreased immunoreactivity. While the necessary actin and β-dystroglycan binding sites are present in both proteins, important functional distinctions can be identified in these domains and some other parts of truncated dystrophins might need redesigning due to their potentially immunogenic qualities. Alternatively, therapies based on utrophins might provide a safer and more effective approach.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"41328300\">Title: Genetic strategies for therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nAuthors: Łoboda, Agnieszka, Chamberlain, Jeffrey S, Dulak, Józef | Year: 2025 | Journal: Molecular therapy. Nucleic acids\nAbstract: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, an essential structural muscle protein. Currently, there are no cures for DMD, and available therapies primarily focus on alleviating symptoms rather than correcting the underlying genetic defect. However, restoration of a shortened version of dystrophin offers the potential for partially addressing the underlying cause of the disease. This review focuses on the promises and challenges of various genetic strategies, such as exon skipping, gene replacement, and gene editing (e.g., by CRISPR-Cas9) aimed at restoring or replacing the dystrophin expression or upregulating utrophin, a paralog of dystrophin that is primarily expressed during fetal life. Finally, novel approaches for modulatory therapies are considered. While they cannot address the cause of DMD, they offer the potential to attenuate the wide-ranging consequences of dystrophin deficiency. Although some of these interventions have demonstrated encouraging preclinical results and early-stage clinical success, challenges remain in optimizing delivery methods, addressing immune responses, and ensuring long-term therapeutic efficacy. Achieving the latter will be crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of already registered exon-skipping strategies and gene therapy with microdystrophin, which is of utmost importance for the validity of the field.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\nSummary comparison (preclinical models):\n\n- Dystrophin restoration\n  - Systemic AAV micro-dystrophin: Produces relatively high, widespread expression of a truncated but functional micro‑dystrophin protein across skeletal muscles and heart after a single systemic dose in mdx and larger-animal models.

Finerenone, a novel, selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, inhibited cardiac remodeling in preclinical models.\nOBJECTIVES\nThis work aims to examine the effect of finerenone on new-onset AFF and cardiorenal effects by history of AFF in the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) study.\nMETHODS\nPatients with CKD and T2D were randomized (1:1) to finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤5,000 mg/g, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25 to <75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and received optimized doses of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Effect on new-onset AFF was evaluated as a pre-specified outcome adjudicated by an independent cardiologist committee. The primary composite outcome (time to first onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of ≥40% in eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes) and key secondary outcome (time to first onset of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) were analyzed by history of AFF.\nRESULTS\nOf 5,674 patients, 461 (8.1%) had a history of AFF. New-onset AFF occurred in 82 (3.2%) patients on finerenone and 117 (4.5%) patients on placebo (hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.94; p = 0.016). The effect of finerenone on primary and key secondary kidney and cardiovascular outcomes was not significantly impacted by baseline AFF (interaction p value: 0.16 and 0.85, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with CKD and T2D, finerenone reduced the risk of new-onset AFF.

These patients are prone to an increased risk of all in-hospital major cardiac complications and also at an increased risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important to quantify the burden of this aggravating complication in an otherwise lethal manifestation of acute coronary syndrome. The aim of this study was to find the frequency of AF in patients presenting with AMI and the factors associated with it. Methods We conducted this observational study on 216 patients who presented with AMI at the largest cardiac center of Karachi, Pakistan from July 2014 to January 2015 with AMI without a past history of AF. Patients underwent routine clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. Atrial fibrillation, detected on electrocardiographic assessment at the time of admission or during hospital stay without a prior history of persistent atrial flutter or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, was classified as new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Results We selected a total of 216 patients, 117 (54.2%) male and mean age of 50.76 ± 6.00 years. Diabetes was found in 140 (64.8%), 164 (75.9%) were hypertensive, and 61 (28.2%) patients were smokers. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was diagnosed in 97 (44.9%) patients. The new onset of atrial fibrillation was found in 27 (12.5%) of the patients with AMI. Univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant association of new-onset AF with hypertension. Conclusion The new onset of atrial fibrillation was found in 12.5% of the patients presented with acute myocardial infarction. It is a significant complication in term of its frequency in AMI and it is more common in hypertensive patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33952399\">Title: Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Caldonazo, Tulio, Kirov, Hristo, Rahouma, Mohamed et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nNew-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery is common, with rates up to 60%. POAF has been associated with early and late stroke, but its association with other cardiovascular outcomes is less known. The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the studies reporting the association of POAF with perioperative and long-term outcomes in patients with cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies that presented outcomes for cardiac surgery on the basis of the presence or absence of POAF. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed; 57 studies (246,340 patients) were selected. Perioperative mortality was the primary outcome. Inverse variance method and random model were performed. Leave-one-out analysis, subgroup analyses, and metaregression were conducted.\nRESULTS\nPOAF was associated with perioperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-2.33), perioperative stroke (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.90-2.49), perioperative myocardial infarction (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.54), perioperative acute renal failure (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.42-3.11), hospital (standardized mean difference, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.53-1.07) and intensive care unit stay (standardized mean difference, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24-0.86), long-term mortality (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40-1.69), long-term stroke (IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.21-1.46), and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (IRR, 4.73; 95% CI, 3.36-6.66).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that POAF after cardiac surgery is associated with an increased occurrence of most short- and long-term cardiovascular adverse events.

Post-discharge all-cause mortality and stroke incidences were compared between the groups.\nRESULTS\nNew-onset AF was observed in 271 patients (10.7%; PaAF: 230, PeAF: 41). The median follow-up period was 7.2 years (IQR: 5.2-9.4). The incidence of all-cause death and stroke was highest in the PeAF group, followed by the PaAF and SR groups (all-cause mortality: 48.8% vs 26.5% vs 14.7%, p<0.001; stroke 22.0% vs 8.3% vs 4.4%, p<0.001). In the multivariable analysis, PaAF and PeAF were associated with an increased risk of stroke (PaAF, HR: 1.972, 95% CI: 1.162-3.346; PeAF, HR: 5.160, CI: 2.242-11.873) compared with SR. The PaAF group showed a higher incidence of post-discharge AF than the SR group (29.1% vs 4.2%, p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nNew-onset AF following AMI is associated with poor long-term outcomes.

Heart failure\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nPrevious studies have examined clinical predictors of incident heart failure (HF) in men and women. However, potential mechanisms through which these clinical predictors relate to the onset of HF remain to be established.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe authors studied the association between clinical and proteomic risk profiles of new-onset HF in men and women.\nMETHODS\nIncident HF was studied in 478,479 participants from the UK Biobank. The association between new-onset HF and 8 common modifiable traditional risk factors, including obesity, smoking status, socioeconomic status, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and history of myocardial infarction, was assessed in men and women. Proteomics data (2,923 unique proteins, Olink) was available in 22,695 men and 27,421 women. Pathway over-representation analyses were performed to identify biological pathways in men and women with and without new-onset HF. Principal component analyses were performed to extract weighted scores for each pathway. Subsequently, weighted scores were used in mediation analyses to investigate how the pathways mediated the association between risk factors and new-onset HF.\nRESULTS\nDuring a median follow-up time of 12 years, HF incident rate was 3.60 per 1,000 person-years in men and 1.72 per 1,000 person-years in women (P < 0.001). The strongest risk factor for future HF was a history of myocardial infarction (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 2.46-2.77) in men and atrial fibrillation (HR: 4.10; 95% CI: 3.58-4.71) in women. When a risk factor was present in women, it conferred a higher risk of new-onset HF compared with the presence of the same risk factor in men. Both in men and women, the population-attributable risk was highest for hypertension (25% in men, 29% in women) and obesity (16% in men, 21% in women). Pathway analyses of protein profiles indicated several inflammatory pathways, and neutrophil degranulation in particular, to be activated both in men and women who developed HF. These inflammatory pathways modestly (22% in men and 24% in women) contributed to the association between hypertension and new-onset HF, but showed a stronger contribution (33% in men and 47% in women) to the association between obesity and new-onset HF.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn men and women, the most prominent risk factors for new-onset HF were hypertension and obesity, but they conferred a greater risk of new-onset HF in women. New-onset HF in both men and women was associated with pathophysiological pathways related to neutrophil degranulation and immunomodulation; and these pathways partly mediated the association between hypertension, obesity, and new-onset HF.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27885969\">Title: 36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine : Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016.\nAuthors: Bateman, R.

Various predictive scores for new-onset AF have been proposed, but so far, none have been widely used in clinical practice. CHARGE-AF score was developed from a pooled diverse population from three large cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Cardiovascular Health Study and Framingham Heart Study). A simple 5-year predictive model includes the variables of age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Recent studies report that the CHARGE-AF score has good discrimination for incident AF and seems to be a promising prediction model for this arrhythmia. New screening tools (smartphone apps, smartwatches) are rapidly developing for AF detection. Therefore, the wide application of the CHARGE-AF score in clinical practice and the upcoming usage of mobile health technologies and smartwatches may result in better AF prediction and adequate stroke prevention, especially in high-risk patients.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>I need higher-level evidence (large registry cohorts and/or meta-analyses) on incidence and long-term risk of death and heart failure after MI with new-onset AF.

We aimed to assess the relative benefit of new oral anticoagulants in key subgroups, and the effects on important secondary outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe searched Medline from Jan 1, 2009, to Nov 19, 2013, limiting searches to phase 3, randomised trials of patients with atrial fibrillation who were randomised to receive new oral anticoagulants or warfarin, and trials in which both efficacy and safety outcomes were reported. We did a prespecified meta-analysis of all 71,683 participants included in the RE-LY, ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials. The main outcomes were stroke and systemic embolic events, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for each outcome. We did subgroup analyses to assess whether differences in patient and trial characteristics affected outcomes. We used a random-effects model to compare pooled outcomes and tested for heterogeneity.\nFINDINGS\n42,411 participants received a new oral anticoagulant and 29,272 participants received warfarin. New oral anticoagulants significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared with warfarin (RR 0·81, 95% CI 0·73-0·91; p<0·0001), mainly driven by a reduction in haemorrhagic stroke (0·49, 0·38-0·64; p<0·0001). New oral anticoagulants also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0·90, 0·85-0·95; p=0·0003) and intracranial haemorrhage (0·48, 0·39-0·59; p<0·0001), but increased gastrointestinal bleeding (1·25, 1·01-1·55; p=0·04). We noted no heterogeneity for stroke or systemic embolic events in important subgroups, but there was a greater relative reduction in major bleeding with new oral anticoagulants when the centre-based time in therapeutic range was less than 66% than when it was 66% or more (0·69, 0·59-0·81 vs 0·93, 0·76-1·13; p for interaction 0·022). Low-dose new oral anticoagulant regimens showed similar overall reductions in stroke or systemic embolic events to warfarin (1·03, 0·84-1·27; p=0·74), and a more favourable bleeding profile (0·65, 0·43-1·00; p=0·05), but significantly more ischaemic strokes (1·28, 1·02-1·60; p=0·045).\nINTERPRETATION\nThis meta-analysis is the first to include data for all four new oral anticoagulants studied in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for stroke prevention or systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. New oral anticoagulants had a favourable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, and with similar major bleeding as for warfarin, but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The relative efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants was consistent across a wide range of patients. Our findings offer clinicians a more comprehensive picture of the new oral anticoagulants as a therapeutic option to reduce the risk of stroke in this patient population.\nFUNDING\nNone.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37952187\">Title: Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Device-Detected Atrial Fibrillation: A Study-Level Meta-Analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA Trials.\nAuthors: McIntyre, William F, Benz, Alexander P, Becher, Nina et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Circulation\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nDevice-detected atrial fibrillation (also known as subclinical atrial fibrillation or atrial high-rate episodes) is a common finding in patients with an implanted cardiac rhythm device and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Whether oral anticoagulation is effective and safe in this patient population is unclear.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Embase for randomized trials comparing oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet or no antithrombotic therapy in adults with device-detected atrial fibrillation recorded by a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy device, or implanted cardiac monitor. We used random-effects models for meta-analysis and rated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework (GRADE). The review was preregistered (PROSPERO CRD42023463212).\nRESULTS\nFrom 785 citations, we identified 2 randomized trials with relevant clinical outcome data: NOAH-AFNET 6 (Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes; 2536 participants) evaluated edoxaban, and ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation; 4012 participants) evaluated apixaban. Meta-analysis demonstrated that oral anticoagulation with these agents reduced ischemic stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; high-quality evidence). The results from the 2 trials were consistent (I 2 statistic for heterogeneity=0%). Oral anticoagulation also reduced a composite of cardiovascular death, all-cause stroke, peripheral arterial embolism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73-0.99]; I 2 =0%; moderate-quality evidence). There was no reduction in cardiovascular death (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.76-1.17]; I 2 =0%; moderate-quality evidence) or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.96-1.21]; I 2 =0%; moderate-quality evidence). Oral anticoagulation increased major bleeding (RR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.05-2.50]; I²=61%; high-quality evidence).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials are consistent with each other. Meta-analysis of these 2 large randomized trials provides high-quality evidence that oral anticoagulation with edoxaban or apixaban reduces the risk of stroke in patients with device-detected atrial fibrillation and increases the risk of major bleeding.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39393620\">Title: The effect of colchicine on myocardial infarction: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nAuthors: Younas, Ayesha, Awan, Zainab, Khan, Tehreem et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Current problems in cardiology\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nMyocardial infarction (MI) is associated with a significant post-event inflammatory response which further contributes to post-MI prognosis. Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory agent, exhibits potential benefits in various cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, pericarditis and atrial fibrillation. This meta-analysis predominantly aimed to provide an up-to-date evaluation of the efficacy and safety of colchicine in reducing adverse cardiovascular events in patients following acute MI.\nMETHODS\nA Comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of colchicine on patients with MI from inception till May 2024. Our primary outcome was a composite of adverse cardiovascular events, while secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, incidence of stroke, incidence of cardiac arrest, hospitalization urgency, incidence of recurrent MI, adverse gastrointestinal events and levels of high-sensitivity C - reactive protein (Hs-CRP). Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) were pooled under the random-effects model.\nRESULTS\nEleven trials with 7161 patients were included in our analysis out of which 3546 (49.51 %) were allocated to colchicine and 3591 (50.14 %) received placebo. Colchicine demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the composite of adverse cardiovascular events (RR = 0.75, 95 % CI: 0.60-0.94, P = 0.01, I 2 = 47 %), and hospitalization urgency (RR = 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.31-0.68, P = 0.0001, I 2 = 0 %) but statistically significant increment in adverse gastrointestinal events (RR = 1.86, 95 % CI: 1.14-3.02, P = 0.01, I 2 = 79 %). However, all-cause mortality (RR = 1.00, 95 % CI: 0.72-1.39, P = 0.98, I 2 = 0 %), incidence of cardiac arrest (RR = 0.81, 95 % CI: 0.33-1.95, P = 0.63, I 2 = 0), incidence of stroke (RR = 0.45, 95 % CI: 0.17-1.19, P = 0.11, I 2 = 36 %), incidence of recurrent MI (RR = 0.78, 95 % CI: 0.57-1.06, P = 0.11, I 2 = 11 %) and the levels of hs-CRP (MD= -0.87, 95 %CI: -1.80-0.06, P=0.07, I 2 =67 % remained comparable across the two groups.\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of colchicine post-MI reduces the composite of adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalization urgency but increases adverse gastrointestinal events. However, colchicine does not impact all-cause mortality, cardiac arrest, stroke incidence, incidence of recurrent MI and the levels of hs-CRP. Large scale multicenter RCTs especially with longer follow-up duration are warranted to validate these findings.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27885969\">Title: 36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine : Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016.\nAuthors: Bateman, R.

The outcomes of interest were MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction , or stroke), individual components of MACE (inclusive of fatal and nonfatal events), all-cause mortality, and death subtypes. Effect estimates for SGLT2i versus placebo were meta-analyzed across trials and examined across key subgroups (established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, previous HF, albuminuria, chronic kidney disease stages, and risk groups).\nRESULTS\nA total of 78 607 patients across 11 trials were included: 42 568 (54.2%), 20 725 (26.4%), and 15 314 (19.5%) were included from trials of patients with diabetes at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF, or chronic kidney disease, respectively. SGLT2i reduced the rate of MACE by 9% (hazard ration [HR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.96], P <0.0001) with a consistent effect across all 3 patient populations ( I 2 =0%) and across all key subgroups. This effect was primarily driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81-0.92], P <0.0001), with no significant effect for myocardial infarction in the overall population (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87-1.04], P =0.29), and no effect on stroke (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91-1.07], P =0.77). The benefit for cardiovascular death was driven primarily by reductions in HF death and sudden cardiac death (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.46-1.02] and HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.78-0.95], respectively) and was generally consistent across subgroups, with the possible exception of being more apparent in those with albuminuria ( P interaction =0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS\nSGLT2i reduce the risk of MACE across a broad range of patients irrespective of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney function, or other major clinical characteristics at baseline. This effect is driven primarily by a reduction of cardiovascular death, particularly HF death and sudden cardiac death, without a significant effect on myocardial infarction in the overall population, and no effect on stroke. These data may help inform selection for SGLT2i therapies across the spectrum of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic disease.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">new-onset atrial fibrillation acute myocardial infarction meta-analysis</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 32 results.

POAF has been associated with early and late stroke, but its association with other cardiovascular outcomes is less known. The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the studies reporting the association of POAF with perioperative and long-term outcomes in patients with cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies that presented outcomes for cardiac surgery on the basis of the presence or absence of POAF. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed; 57 studies (246,340 patients) were selected. Perioperative mortality was the primary outcome. Inverse variance method and random model were performed. Leave-one-out analysis, subgroup analyses, and metaregression were conducted.\nRESULTS\nPOAF was associated with perioperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-2.33), perioperative stroke (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.90-2.49), perioperative myocardial infarction (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.54), perioperative acute renal failure (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.42-3.11), hospital (standardized mean difference, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.53-1.07) and intensive care unit stay (standardized mean difference, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24-0.86), long-term mortality (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40-1.69), long-term stroke (IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.21-1.46), and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (IRR, 4.73; 95% CI, 3.36-6.66).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that POAF after cardiac surgery is associated with an increased occurrence of most short- and long-term cardiovascular adverse events. However, the causality of this association remains to be established.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31261502\">Title: Clinical risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: He, Jing, Yang, Yi, Zhang, Gui et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Medicine\nAbstract: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) remains common arrhythmia in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is closely associated with increased subsequent cardiovascular mortality. Our meta-analysis aims to summarize more clinical risk factors for NOAF.Comprehensive systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were carried out to find relevant studies inception to December 2017. Pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the value of clinical risk factors in the prediction of NOAF after AMI.Eleven studies containing 9570 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, older age and increased heart rate (HR) levels had a significant positive association with NOAF in patients with AMI. The MD in age between the patients with, and those without NOAF, was 8.22 units (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.44-9.01), test for overall effect z score = 20.51 (P < .00001, I = 0%). Moreover, the MD in a subgroup analysis for HR levels between the patients with, and those without NOAF was 4.34 units (95% Cl: 2.56-6.11), test for overall effect z score = 4.78 (P < .00001, I = 31%).In patient with AMI, our meta-analysis demonstrated that older age and increased HR levels on admission are related to greater risk of NOAF.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27885969\">Title: 36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine : Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016.\nAuthors: Bateman, R.

The ultimate predictive value of high Killips class on NOAF remained obscure.\nMETHODS\nPubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register Databases were searched until February 2015. Of the 3732 initially identified studies, 5 observational studies with 10,053 patients were analyzed.\nRESULTS\nThe meta-analysis of these studies showed that higher Killips score on admission was associated with higher incidence of NOAF following AMI (odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval 1.96-2.67, P < 0.00001), while no significant differences exist among individual trials (P = 0.14 and I2 = 43%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nKillips class >I was associated with the higher opportunity of developing NOAF following AMI.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n...converted to sinus rhythm) and worst outcomes in those with persistent NOAF.\n\nKey additional findings from contemporary cohorts and synthesis\n- Independence of the association: In the majority of well‑adjusted observational analyses, NOAF after MI remains an independent predictor of worse long‑term survival even after accounting for age, comorbidities, infarct severity/Killip class, left ventricular ejection fraction and in‑hospital complications. Effect sizes vary by study and AF pattern, but the excess risk is reproducible across settings.\n- Pattern matters: Persistent or sustained NOAF confers substantially greater adverse prognosis than transient/paroxysmal NOAF, with paroxysmal events carrying an intermediate risk between persistent AF and those who remain in sinus rhythm.\n- Heart failure (HF) outcomes: NOAF is also associated with a higher incidence of subsequent HF development and HF hospitalizations. This relationship appears both because NOAF may reflect larger infarcts/hemodynamic compromise and because AF itself can worsen cardiac output and promote remodeling that leads to clinical HF.\n- Stroke and thromboembolism: NOAF after MI increases thromboembolic risk compared with patients who remain in sinus rhythm. Stroke risk contributes to the excess morbidity and mortality observed and informs secondary prevention decisions.\n- Heterogeneity and confounding: Not all studies find identical effect sizes; part of the heterogeneity is explained by differences in patient populations (STEMI vs NSTEMI), reperfusion rates, rates of baseline HF, definitions of NOAF (in‑hospital only vs post‑discharge detection) and duration/type of AF monitoring. In some analyses, adjustment for markers of myocardial damage and heart failure attenuates but does not eliminate the association.\n\nProposed mechanisms linking NOAF after MI to worse outcomes\n- NOAF as a marker: it often indicates larger infarct size, greater left ventricular dysfunction, higher filling pressures and systemic inflammation.\n- NOAF as a mediator: AF can reduce cardiac output, increase filling pressures, and provoke or worsen HF; it also increases risk of stroke and systemic embolism.\n- Shared substrate: common underlying factors (age, structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes) predispose to both AF and adverse post‑MI remodeling.\n\nClinical implications and management considerations\n- Risk stratification: identify patients with NOAF as a higher‑risk subgroup who need intensified follow‑up and optimization of guideline‑directed medical therapies for ischemic heart disease and heart failure.\n- Antithrombotic therapy: decisions on anticoagulation should follow established stroke‑risk assessment (e.g., CHA2DS2‑VASc) and balance bleeding risk—transient post‑MI AF still confers stroke risk in many patients and often warrants consideration of long‑term anticoagulation.\n- Rhythm vs rate control: no MI‑specific randomized evidence shows a clear mortality benefit of one strategy over the other for post‑MI NOAF. Rhythm control may be favored in selected patients (symptomatic AF, tachycardia‑mediated cardiomyopathy) but should be individualized.\n- Heart failure prevention: aggressive management of ischemia, neurohormonal blockade (ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta‑blocker, MRA where indicated), and close surveillance for evolving LV dysfunction is important to mitigate progression to symptomatic HF.\n- Monitoring: prolonged rhythm monitoring after discharge can unmask recurrent or persistent AF and guide long‑term management (anticoagulation, ablation consideration).\n\nSummary\nNew‑onset atrial fibrillation complicates roughly one in ten contemporary MI admissions and is consistently associated with worse long‑term mortality and greater risk of developing or being hospitalized for heart failure. The risk is greatest when AF persists rather than being transient. NOAF should therefore prompt targeted secondary prevention: careful assessment of stroke risk and bleeding risk to guide anticoagulation, optimization of evidence‑based post‑MI and HF therapies, and closer cardiology follow‑up (including consideration of extended rhythm monitoring and individualized rhythm management strategies).\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "new-onset atrial fibrillation myocardial infarction mortality", "result": {"total": 377, "data": [{"paperId": "37952754", "title": "New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation Before Or After Myocardial Infarction, Which Is Worse for Mortality?", "abstract": "", "year": "2024", "venue": "The American journal of cardiology"}, {"paperId": "34015478", "title": "Finerenone Reduces New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) due to cardiac remodeling and kidney complications. Finerenone, a novel, selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, inhibited cardiac remodeling in preclinical models.\nOBJECTIVES\nThis work aims to examine the effect of finerenone on new-onset AFF and cardiorenal effects by history of AFF in the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) study.\nMETHODS\nPatients with CKD and T2D were randomized (1:1) to finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤5,000 mg/g, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25 to <75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and received optimized doses of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Effect on new-onset AFF was evaluated as a pre-specified outcome adjudicated by an independent cardiologist committee. The primary composite outcome (time to first onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of ≥40% in eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes) and key secondary outcome (time to first onset of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) were analyzed by history of AFF.\nRESULTS\nOf 5,674 patients, 461 (8.1%) had a history of AFF. New-onset AFF occurred in 82 (3.2%) patients on finerenone and 117 (4.5%) patients on placebo (hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.94; p = 0.016). The effect of finerenone on primary and key secondary kidney and cardiovascular outcomes was not significantly impacted by baseline AFF (interaction p value: 0.16 and 0.85, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with CKD and T2D, finerenone reduced the risk of new-onset AFF. The risk of kidney or cardiovascular events was reduced irrespective of history of AFF at baseline.

These patients are prone to an increased risk of all in-hospital major cardiac complications and also at an increased risk of mortality.

The aim of this study was to find the frequency of AF in patients presenting with AMI and the factors associated with it. Methods We conducted this observational study on 216 patients who presented with AMI at the largest cardiac center of Karachi, Pakistan from July 2014 to January 2015 with AMI without a past history of AF. Patients underwent routine clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. Atrial fibrillation, detected on electrocardiographic assessment at the time of admission or during hospital stay without a prior history of persistent atrial flutter or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, was classified as new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Results We selected a total of 216 patients, 117 (54.2%) male and mean age of 50.76 ± 6.00 years. Diabetes was found in 140 (64.8%), 164 (75.9%) were hypertensive, and 61 (28.2%) patients were smokers. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was diagnosed in 97 (44.9%) patients. The new onset of atrial fibrillation was found in 27 (12.5%) of the patients with AMI. Univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant association of new-onset AF with hypertension. Conclusion The new onset of atrial fibrillation was found in 12.5% of the patients presented with acute myocardial infarction.

Finerenone, a novel, selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, inhibited cardiac remodeling in preclinical models.\nOBJECTIVES\nThis work aims to examine the effect of finerenone on new-onset AFF and cardiorenal effects by history of AFF in the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) study.\nMETHODS\nPatients with CKD and T2D were randomized (1:1) to finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤5,000 mg/g, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25 to <75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and received optimized doses of renin-angiotensin system blockade. Effect on new-onset AFF was evaluated as a pre-specified outcome adjudicated by an independent cardiologist committee. The primary composite outcome (time to first onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of ≥40% in eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes) and key secondary outcome (time to first onset of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) were analyzed by history of AFF.\nRESULTS\nOf 5,674 patients, 461 (8.1%) had a history of AFF. New-onset AFF occurred in 82 (3.2%) patients on finerenone and 117 (4.5%) patients on placebo (hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.94; p = 0.016).

However, potential mechanisms through which these clinical predictors relate to the onset of HF remain to be established.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe authors studied the association between clinical and proteomic risk profiles of new-onset HF in men and women.\nMETHODS\nIncident HF was studied in 478,479 participants from the UK Biobank. The association between new-onset HF and 8 common modifiable traditional risk factors, including obesity, smoking status, socioeconomic status, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and history of myocardial infarction, was assessed in men and women. Proteomics data (2,923 unique proteins, Olink) was available in 22,695 men and 27,421 women. Pathway over-representation analyses were performed to identify biological pathways in men and women with and without new-onset HF. Principal component analyses were performed to extract weighted scores for each pathway. Subsequently, weighted scores were used in mediation analyses to investigate how the pathways mediated the association between risk factors and new-onset HF.\nRESULTS\nDuring a median follow-up time of 12 years, HF incident rate was 3.60 per 1,000 person-years in men and 1.72 per 1,000 person-years in women (P < 0.001). The strongest risk factor for future HF was a history of myocardial infarction (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 2.46-2.77) in men and atrial fibrillation (HR: 4.10; 95% CI: 3.58-4.71) in women. When a risk factor was present in women, it conferred a higher risk of new-onset HF compared with the presence of the same risk factor in men. Both in men and women, the population-attributable risk was highest for hypertension (25% in men, 29% in women) and obesity (16% in men, 21% in women). Pathway analyses of protein profiles indicated several inflammatory pathways, and neutrophil degranulation in particular, to be activated both in men and women who developed HF. These inflammatory pathways modestly (22% in men and 24% in women) contributed to the association between hypertension and new-onset HF, but showed a stronger contribution (33% in men and 47% in women) to the association between obesity and new-onset HF.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn men and women, the most prominent risk factors for new-onset HF were hypertension and obesity, but they conferred a greater risk of new-onset HF in women. New-onset HF in both men and women was associated with pathophysiological pathways related to neutrophil degranulation and immunomodulation; and these pathways partly mediated the association between hypertension, obesity, and new-onset HF.", "year": "2025", "venue": "JACC.

CHARGE-AF score was developed from a pooled diverse population from three large cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, Cardiovascular Health Study and Framingham Heart Study). A simple 5-year predictive model includes the variables of age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction and heart failure. Recent studies report that the CHARGE-AF score has good discrimination for incident AF and seems to be a promising prediction model for this arrhythmia.

We aimed to assess the relative benefit of new oral anticoagulants in key subgroups, and the effects on important secondary outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe searched Medline from Jan 1, 2009, to Nov 19, 2013, limiting searches to phase 3, randomised trials of patients with atrial fibrillation who were randomised to receive new oral anticoagulants or warfarin, and trials in which both efficacy and safety outcomes were reported. We did a prespecified meta-analysis of all 71,683 participants included in the RE-LY, ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials. The main outcomes were stroke and systemic embolic events, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for each outcome. We did subgroup analyses to assess whether differences in patient and trial characteristics affected outcomes. We used a random-effects model to compare pooled outcomes and tested for heterogeneity.\nFINDINGS\n42,411 participants received a new oral anticoagulant and 29,272 participants received warfarin. New oral anticoagulants significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared with warfarin (RR 0·81, 95% CI 0·73-0·91; p<0·0001), mainly driven by a reduction in haemorrhagic stroke (0·49, 0·38-0·64; p<0·0001). New oral anticoagulants also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0·90, 0·85-0·95; p=0·0003) and intracranial haemorrhage (0·48, 0·39-0·59; p<0·0001), but increased gastrointestinal bleeding (1·25, 1·01-1·55; p=0·04). We noted no heterogeneity for stroke or systemic embolic events in important subgroups, but there was a greater relative reduction in major bleeding with new oral anticoagulants when the centre-based time in therapeutic range was less than 66% than when it was 66% or more (0·69, 0·59-0·81 vs 0·93, 0·76-1·13; p for interaction 0·022). Low-dose new oral anticoagulant regimens showed similar overall reductions in stroke or systemic embolic events to warfarin (1·03, 0·84-1·27; p=0·74), and a more favourable bleeding profile (0·65, 0·43-1·00; p=0·05), but significantly more ischaemic strokes (1·28, 1·02-1·60; p=0·045).\nINTERPRETATION\nThis meta-analysis is the first to include data for all four new oral anticoagulants studied in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for stroke prevention or systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. New oral anticoagulants had a favourable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, and with similar major bleeding as for warfarin, but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The relative efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants was consistent across a wide range of patients. Our findings offer clinicians a more comprehensive picture of the new oral anticoagulants as a therapeutic option to reduce the risk of stroke in this patient population.\nFUNDING\nNone.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Lancet (London, England)"}, {"paperId": "37952187", "title": "Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Device-Detected Atrial Fibrillation: A Study-Level Meta-Analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA Trials.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nDevice-detected atrial fibrillation (also known as subclinical atrial fibrillation or atrial high-rate episodes) is a common finding in patients with an implanted cardiac rhythm device and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Whether oral anticoagulation is effective and safe in this patient population is unclear.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Embase for randomized trials comparing oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet or no antithrombotic therapy in adults with device-detected atrial fibrillation recorded by a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy device, or implanted cardiac monitor. We used random-effects models for meta-analysis and rated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework (GRADE). The review was preregistered (PROSPERO CRD42023463212).\nRESULTS\nFrom 785 citations, we identified 2 randomized trials with relevant clinical outcome data: NOAH-AFNET 6 (Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes; 2536 participants) evaluated edoxaban, and ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation; 4012 participants) evaluated apixaban. Meta-analysis demonstrated that oral anticoagulation with these agents reduced ischemic stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; high-quality evidence). The results from the 2 trials were consistent (I 2 statistic for heterogeneity=0%). Oral anticoagulation also reduced a composite of cardiovascular death, all-cause stroke, peripheral arterial embolism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73-0.99]; I 2 =0%; moderate-quality evidence). There was no reduction in cardiovascular death (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.76-1.17]; I 2 =0%; moderate-quality evidence) or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.96-1.21]; I 2 =0%; moderate-quality evidence). Oral anticoagulation increased major bleeding (RR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.05-2.50]; I²=61%; high-quality evidence).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials are consistent with each other.

Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory agent, exhibits potential benefits in various cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, pericarditis and atrial fibrillation. This meta-analysis predominantly aimed to provide an up-to-date evaluation of the efficacy and safety of colchicine in reducing adverse cardiovascular events in patients following acute MI.\nMETHODS\nA Comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of colchicine on patients with MI from inception till May 2024. Our primary outcome was a composite of adverse cardiovascular events, while secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, incidence of stroke, incidence of cardiac arrest, hospitalization urgency, incidence of recurrent MI, adverse gastrointestinal events and levels of high-sensitivity C - reactive protein (Hs-CRP). Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) were pooled under the random-effects model.\nRESULTS\nEleven trials with 7161 patients were included in our analysis out of which 3546 (49.51 %) were allocated to colchicine and 3591 (50.14 %) received placebo. Colchicine demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the composite of adverse cardiovascular events (RR = 0.75, 95 % CI: 0.60-0.94, P = 0.01, I 2 = 47 %), and hospitalization urgency (RR = 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.31-0.68, P = 0.0001, I 2 = 0 %) but statistically significant increment in adverse gastrointestinal events (RR = 1.86, 95 % CI: 1.14-3.02, P = 0.01, I 2 = 79 %). However, all-cause mortality (RR = 1.00, 95 % CI: 0.72-1.39, P = 0.98, I 2 = 0 %), incidence of cardiac arrest (RR = 0.81, 95 % CI: 0.33-1.95, P = 0.63, I 2 = 0), incidence of stroke (RR = 0.45, 95 % CI: 0.17-1.19, P = 0.11, I 2 = 36 %), incidence of recurrent MI (RR = 0.78, 95 % CI: 0.57-1.06, P = 0.11, I 2 = 11 %) and the levels of hs-CRP (MD= -0.87, 95 %CI: -1.80-0.06, P=0.07, I 2 =67 % remained comparable across the two groups.\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of colchicine post-MI reduces the composite of adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalization urgency but increases adverse gastrointestinal events. However, colchicine does not impact all-cause mortality, cardiac arrest, stroke incidence, incidence of recurrent MI and the levels of hs-CRP.

The outcomes of interest were MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction , or stroke), individual components of MACE (inclusive of fatal and nonfatal events), all-cause mortality, and death subtypes. Effect estimates for SGLT2i versus placebo were meta-analyzed across trials and examined across key subgroups (established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, previous HF, albuminuria, chronic kidney disease stages, and risk groups).\nRESULTS\nA total of 78 607 patients across 11 trials were included: 42 568 (54.2%), 20 725 (26.4%), and 15 314 (19.5%) were included from trials of patients with diabetes at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF, or chronic kidney disease, respectively. SGLT2i reduced the rate of MACE by 9% (hazard ration [HR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.96], P <0.0001) with a consistent effect across all 3 patient populations ( I 2 =0%) and across all key subgroups. This effect was primarily driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81-0.92], P <0.0001), with no significant effect for myocardial infarction in the overall population (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87-1.04], P =0.29), and no effect on stroke (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91-1.07], P =0.77). The benefit for cardiovascular death was driven primarily by reductions in HF death and sudden cardiac death (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.46-1.02] and HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.78-0.95], respectively) and was generally consistent across subgroups, with the possible exception of being more apparent in those with albuminuria ( P interaction =0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS\nSGLT2i reduce the risk of MACE across a broad range of patients irrespective of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney function, or other major clinical characteristics at baseline. This effect is driven primarily by a reduction of cardiovascular death, particularly HF death and sudden cardiac death, without a significant effect on myocardial infarction in the overall population, and no effect on stroke.

POAF has been associated with early and late stroke, but its association with other cardiovascular outcomes is less known. The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the studies reporting the association of POAF with perioperative and long-term outcomes in patients with cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies that presented outcomes for cardiac surgery on the basis of the presence or absence of POAF. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed; 57 studies (246,340 patients) were selected. Perioperative mortality was the primary outcome. Inverse variance method and random model were performed. Leave-one-out analysis, subgroup analyses, and metaregression were conducted.\nRESULTS\nPOAF was associated with perioperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-2.33), perioperative stroke (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.90-2.49), perioperative myocardial infarction (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06-1.54), perioperative acute renal failure (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.42-3.11), hospital (standardized mean difference, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.53-1.07) and intensive care unit stay (standardized mean difference, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24-0.86), long-term mortality (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40-1.69), long-term stroke (IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.21-1.46), and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (IRR, 4.73; 95% CI, 3.36-6.66).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results suggest that POAF after cardiac surgery is associated with an increased occurrence of most short- and long-term cardiovascular adverse events. However, the causality of this association remains to be established.", "year": "2023", "venue": "The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery"}, {"paperId": "31261502", "title": "Clinical risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "abstract": "New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) remains common arrhythmia in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is closely associated with increased subsequent cardiovascular mortality. Our meta-analysis aims to summarize more clinical risk factors for NOAF.Comprehensive systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were carried out to find relevant studies inception to December 2017. Pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the value of clinical risk factors in the prediction of NOAF after AMI.Eleven studies containing 9570 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, older age and increased heart rate (HR) levels had a significant positive association with NOAF in patients with AMI. The MD in age between the patients with, and those without NOAF, was 8.22 units (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.44-9.01), test for overall effect z score = 20.51 (P < .00001, I = 0%). Moreover, the MD in a subgroup analysis for HR levels between the patients with, and those without NOAF was 4.34 units (95% Cl: 2.56-6.11), test for overall effect z score = 4.78 (P < .00001, I = 31%).In patient with AMI, our meta-analysis demonstrated that older age and increased HR levels on admission are related to greater risk of NOAF.", "year": "2019", "venue": "Medicine"}, {"paperId": "27885969", "title": "36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine : Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016.", "abstract": "P001 - Sepsis impairs the capillary response within hypoxic capillaries and decreases erythrocyte oxygen-dependent ATP efflux R.

The incidence of MS is increasing worldwide, together with the socioeconomic impact of the disease. The underlying cause of MS and mechanisms behind this increase remain opaque, although complex gene-environment interactions almost certainly play a significant role. The epidemiology of MS indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood obesity and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus are likely to play a role in disease development. Changes in diagnostic methods and criteria mean that people with MS can be diagnosed increasingly early in their disease trajectory. Alongside this, treatments for MS have increased exponentially in number, efficacy and risk. There is now the possibility of a diagnosis of 'pre-symptomatic MS' being made; as a result potentially preventive strategies could be studied. In this comprehensive review, MS epidemiology, potential aetiological factors and pathology are discussed, before moving on to clinical aspects of MS diagnosis and management.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35931816\">Title: Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis.\nAuthors: Soldan, Samantha S, Lieberman, Paul M | Year: 2023 | Journal: Nature reviews. Microbiology\nAbstract: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human lymphotropic herpesvirus with a well-established causal role in several cancers. Recent studies have provided compelling epidemiological and mechanistic evidence for a causal role of EBV in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system and is thought to be triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by an infectious agent, with EBV as the lead candidate. How a ubiquitous virus that typically leads to benign latent infections can promote cancer and autoimmune disease in at-risk populations is not fully understood. Here we review the evidence that EBV is a causal agent for MS and how various risk factors may affect EBV infection and immune control. We focus on EBV contributing to MS through reprogramming of latently infected B lymphocytes and the chronic presentation of viral antigens as a potential source of autoreactivity through molecular mimicry. We consider how knowledge of EBV-associated cancers may be instructive for understanding the role of EBV in MS and discuss the potential for therapies that target EBV to treat MS.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35938654\">Title: Epidemiology and Pathophysiology of Multiple Sclerosis.\nAuthors: Ward, Melanie, Goldman, Myla D | Year: 2022 | Journal: Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nThis article provides an overview of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle risk factors affecting the disease course of multiple sclerosis (MS) and reviews the pathophysiologic characteristics of both relapsing and progressive MS.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nThe prevalence of MS has increased in recent decades, and costs of care for patients with MS have risen dramatically. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals may be at risk for more severe MS-related disability. Multiple genetic MS risk factors have been identified. Factors such as low vitamin D levels and a history of Epstein-Barr virus, smoking, and obesity, especially during childhood, also influence MS risk. Traditionally thought to be a T-cell-mediated disease, recent research has highlighted the additional roles of B cells and microglia in both relapsing and progressive MS.\nSUMMARY\nComplex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors affect the risk for MS as well as the disease course. People of color have historically been underrepresented in both MS clinical trials and literature, but current research is attempting to better clarify unique considerations in these groups. MS pathology consists of the focal inflammatory lesions that have been well characterized in relapsing MS, as well as a more widespread neurodegenerative component that is posited to drive progressive disease. Recent advances in characterization of both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathophysiology have yielded potential targets for future therapeutic options.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36759741\">Title: Epstein-Barr virus as a leading cause of multiple sclerosis: mechanisms and implications.\nAuthors: Bjornevik, Kjetil, Münz, Christian, Cohen, Jeffrey I et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Nature reviews. Neurology\nAbstract: Epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare complication of infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus that infects more than 90% of the global population. This link was long suspected because the risk of MS increases markedly after infectious mononucleosis (symptomatic primary EBV infection) and with high titres of antibodies to specific EBV antigens. However, it was not until 2022 that a longitudinal study demonstrated that MS risk is minimal in individuals who are not infected with EBV and that it increases over 30-fold following EBV infection. Over the past few years, a number of studies have provided clues on the underlying mechanisms, which might help us to develop more targeted treatments for MS. In this Review, we discuss the evidence linking EBV to the development of MS and the mechanisms by which the virus is thought to cause the disease. Furthermore, we discuss implications for the treatment and prevention of MS, including the use of antivirals and vaccines.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33488588\">Title: Epstein-Barr Virus and Systemic Autoimmune Diseases.\nAuthors: Houen, Gunnar, Trier, Nicole Hartwig | Year: 2020 | Journal: Frontiers in immunology\nAbstract: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is an extremely successful human herpes virus, which infects essentially all human beings at some time during their life span. EBV infection and the associated immune response results in production of antibodies (seroconversion), which occurs mainly during the first years of life, but may also happen during adolescence or later in life. Infection of adolescents can result in infectious mononucleosis, an acute serious condition characterized by massive lymphocytosis. Transmission of EBV mainly occurs through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood, e.g. through organ transplantations and blood transfusions. EBV transmission through oral secretions results in infection of epithelial cells of the oropharynx. From the epithelial cells EBV can infect B cells, which are the major reservoir for the virus, but other cell types may also become infected. As a result, EBV can shuttle between different cell types, mainly B cells and epithelial cells. Moreover, since the virus can switch between a latent and a lytic life cycle, EBV has the ability to cause chronic relapsing/reactivating infections. Chronic or recurrent EBV infection of epithelial cells has been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome, whereas chronic/recurrent infection of B cells has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Accordingly, since EBV can shuttle between epithelial cells and B cells, the systemic autoimmune diseases often occur as overlapping syndromes with symptoms and characteristic autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors) reflecting epithelial and/or B cell infection.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31088382\">Title: Epstein-Barr virus and its association with disease - a review of relevance to general practice.\nAuthors: Fugl, Anders, Andersen, Christen Lykkegaard | Year: 2019 | Journal: BMC family practice\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nGeneral practitioners encounter the vast majority of patients with Epstein-Barr virus-related disease, i.e. infectious mononucleosis in children and adolescents. With the expanding knowledge regarding the multifaceted role of Epstein-Barr virus in both benign and malignant disease we chose to focus this review on Epstein-Barr virus-related conditions with relevance to the general practitioners. A PubMed and Google Scholar literature search was performed using PubMed's MeSH terms of relevance to Epstein-Barr virus/infectious mononucleosis in regard to complications and associated conditions.\nMAIN TEXT\nIn the present review, these included three early complications; hepatitis, splenic rupture and airway compromise, as well as possible late conditions; lymphoproliferative cancers, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection. This review thus highlights recent advances in the understanding of Epstein-Barr virus pathogenesis, focusing on management, acute complications, referral indications and potentially associated conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHepatitis is a common and self-limiting early complication to infectious mononucleosis and should be monitored with liver tests in more symptomatic cases. Splenic rupture is rare. Most cases are seen within 3 weeks after diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis and may occur spontaneously. There is no consensus on the safe return to physical activities, and ultrasonic assessment of spleen size may provide the best estimate of risk. Airway compromise due to tonsil enlargement is encountered in a minority of patients and should be treated with systemic corticosteroids during hospitalization. Association between lymphoproliferative cancers, especially Hodgkin lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma, and infectious mononucleosis are well-established. Epstein-Barr virus infection/infectious mononucleosis as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis has been documented and may be linked to genetic susceptibility. Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection is rare. However, a general practitioner should be aware of this as a differential diagnosis in patients with persisting symptoms of infectious mononucleosis for more than 3 months.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36764322\">Title: Epstein-Barr virus as a cause of multiple sclerosis: opportunities for prevention and therapy.\nAuthors: Aloisi, Francesca, Giovannoni, Gavin, Salvetti, Marco | Year: 2023 | Journal: The Lancet. Neurology\nAbstract: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS that results from the interplay between heritable and environmental factors. Mounting evidence from different fields of research supports the pivotal role of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the development of multiple sclerosis. However, translating this knowledge into clinically actionable information requires a better understanding of the mechanisms linking EBV to pathophysiology. Ongoing research is trying to clarify whether EBV causes neuroinflammation via autoimmunity or antiviral immunity, and if the interaction of EBV with genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis can explain why a ubiquitous virus promotes immune dysfunction in susceptible individuals. If EBV also has a role in driving disease activity, the characterisation of this role will help diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in people with multiple sclerosis. Ongoing clinical trials targeting EBV and new anti-EBV vaccines provide hope for future treatments and preventive interventions.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35931008\">Title: MINI-review of Epstein-Barr virus involvement in multiple sclerosis etiology and pathogenesis.\nAuthors: Aloisi, Francesca, Cross, Anne H | Year: 2022 | Journal: Journal of neuroimmunology\nAbstract: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the infectious agent that shows the strongest association with multiple sclerosis (MS). EBV is a ubiquitous double stranded DNA herpes virus that establishes a latent infection in B cells and is actively contained by the immune system throughout the life of its human host. Failure to control EBV infection can lead to the development of cancers and immunopathological diseases characterized by hyperreactive anti-EBV immune responses. Although MS is the result of still poorly understood interactions between genetic and environmental factors, compelling evidence indicates that EBV infection is essential for MS initiation. B cells are clearly key in the development of MS activity, given the extraordinary effectiveness of B cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in relapsing MS patients. This commentary reviews the evidence supporting the link of EBV with MS and the mechanisms by which EBV might trigger MS and cause continued disease activity. Also discussed are trials of agents to reduce or eliminate EBV in humans, which are expected to provide additional insights into the role of EBV in ongoing MS pathology.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40171883\">Title: Advancements in multiple sclerosis.\nAuthors: Montague, Turlough, Drummond, James, Ng, Karl et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Internal medicine journal\nAbstract: The global prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is increasing, and early diagnosis and treatment is essential in mitigating disability. While recent therapeutic advancements have significantly reduced relapse rates, the progressive and degenerative aspects of MS continue to pose major challenges. This year updates to the McDonald diagnostic criteria aim to enhance sensitivity and facilitate earlier use of disease-modifying therapies in asymptomatic patients. Additionally, novel biomarkers will gain ground in clinical practice and offer new approaches to optimising care. Following the widespread use of cell depleting immunosuppressive agents, innovative therapeutic directions such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccination represent promising new directions in the management of MS. This clinical perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the disease while highlighting important advancements shaping the future of the field.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39390260\">Title: Epstein-Barr virus as a potentiator of autoimmune diseases.\nAuthors: Robinson, William H, Younis, Shady, Love, Zelda Z et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Nature reviews. Rheumatology\nAbstract: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is epidemiologically associated with development of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Although there is well-established evidence for this association, the underlying mechanistic basis remains incompletely defined. In this Review, we discuss the role of EBV infection as a potentiator of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. We review the EBV life cycle, viral transcription programmes, serological profiles and lytic reactivation. We discuss the epidemiological and mechanistic associations of EBV with systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. We describe the potential mechanisms by which EBV might promote autoimmunity, including EBV nuclear antigen 1-mediated molecular mimicry of human autoantigens; EBV-mediated B cell reprogramming, including EBV nuclear antigen 2-mediated dysregulation of autoimmune susceptibility genes; EBV and host genetic factors, including the potential for autoimmunity-promoting strains of EBV; EBV immune evasion and insufficient host responses to control infection; lytic reactivation; and other mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic implications and potential therapeutic approaches to targeting EBV for the treatment of autoimmune disease.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>Short answer\nConverging epidemiological and mechanistic evidence is now strong and internally consistent that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is a major causal factor in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). Many experts characterize EBV as a likely necessary (but not solely sufficient) trigger for MS in genetically and environmentally susceptible people, though definitive “proof” (e.g., experimental prevention of MS by EBV vaccination) is still pending and important mechanistic gaps remain. <cite id=\"36759741\">36759741</cite><cite id=\"35931816\">35931816</cite>\n\nKey epidemiological evidence (strengths)\n- Near-universal EBV seropositivity among people with MS and very low MS incidence in EBV‑seronegative individuals in large prospective cohorts.

This implies EBV is likely necessary but not sufficient—interactions with host genetics, vitamin D, smoking, obesity and timing of infection are important co‑factors. <cite id=\"30300457\">30300457</cite><cite id=\"36759741\">36759741</cite>\n- Observational evidence cannot by itself prove causation; the decisive tests will be intervention studies (antiviral approaches, EBV‑targeted immunotherapies, or preventive EBV vaccination) showing reduced MS incidence or activity. Several such trials are being planned or are under way. <cite id=\"36764322\">36764322</cite>\n\nOverall appraisal (using Bradford Hill–style criteria)\n- Temporality, strength, consistency, biological plausibility and coherence are largely met and have become quite compelling in recent years. Specificity and experimental proof are weaker (awaiting interventional trials).

Moreover, since the virus can switch between a latent and a lytic life cycle, EBV has the ability to cause chronic relapsing/reactivating infections. Chronic or recurrent EBV infection of epithelial cells has been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome, whereas chronic/recurrent infection of B cells has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. Accordingly, since EBV can shuttle between epithelial cells and B cells, the systemic autoimmune diseases often occur as overlapping syndromes with symptoms and characteristic autoantibodies (e.g. antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors) reflecting epithelial and/or B cell infection.", "year": "2020", "venue": "Frontiers in immunology"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-20T15:27:05.404051"}], "final_answer": "Short answer\nConverging epidemiological and mechanistic evidence is now strong and internally consistent that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is a major causal factor in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). Many experts characterize EBV as a likely necessary (but not solely sufficient) trigger for MS in genetically and environmentally susceptible people, though definitive “proof” (e.g., experimental prevention of MS by EBV vaccination) is still pending and important mechanistic gaps remain. <cite id=\"36759741\">36759741</cite><cite id=\"35931816\">35931816</cite>\n\nKey epidemiological evidence (strengths)\n- Near-universal EBV seropositivity among people with MS and very low MS incidence in EBV‑seronegative individuals in large prospective cohorts. Reviews summarize longitudinal data showing MS risk rises sharply after EBV infection (reported >30-fold increase after seroconversion in one major analysis). This provides strong temporality and strength of association. <cite id=\"36759741\">36759741</cite><cite id=\"35931816\">35931816</cite>\n- History of infectious mononucleosis (symptomatic primary EBV infection) is consistently associated with increased MS risk in multiple studies.

This implies EBV is likely necessary but not sufficient—interactions with host genetics, vitamin D, smoking, obesity and timing of infection are important co‑factors. <cite id=\"30300457\">30300457</cite><cite id=\"36759741\">36759741</cite>\n- Observational evidence cannot by itself prove causation; the decisive tests will be intervention studies (antiviral approaches, EBV‑targeted immunotherapies, or preventive EBV vaccination) showing reduced MS incidence or activity. Several such trials are being planned or are under way. <cite id=\"36764322\">36764322</cite>\n\nOverall appraisal (using Bradford Hill–style criteria)\n- Temporality, strength, consistency, biological plausibility and coherence are largely met and have become quite compelling in recent years.

An age-related decline in immune function is of concern when treating older patients because host immune factors can influence clinical outcomes with immunotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ICIs in patients 65 years and older.\nMETHODS\nUsing the SEER-Medicare data, we evaluated survival by first systemic treatment type in a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65 years and older who were diagnosed with stage IV cutaneous melanoma between 2012 and 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.\nRESULTS\nA total of 541 patients were included in this study. Median survival differed significantly between groups (p < 0.0001) and was longest in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors (34.0 months), followed by CTLA-4 inhibitors (16.8 months), targeted therapy (9.7 months), chemotherapy (7.1 months), and no systemic therapy (3.6 months). The ICI survival benefit persisted after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, M stage, the presence of brain metastases, and evaluation at an NCI-designated cancer center. Hazard ratios comparing ICIs to no systemic therapy were 0.35 (95% CI: 0.24-0.52) for PD-1 inhibitors and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.37-0.63) for CTLA-4 inhibitors. We did not observe a difference in ICI effectiveness by age group (65-74 vs ≥75).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a nationally representative cohort of patients with advanced melanoma, ICI therapy delivered in a real world setting significantly improved survival in patients aged 65 years and older.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37095605\">Title: Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma treated with immunotherapy or targeted therapy.\nAuthors: Lee, Sejin, Bennett, Antonia V, Zhou, Xi et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo identify real-world patterns of first line treatment, treatment sequence and outcomes for older adults diagnosed with advanced melanoma who received immunotherapy or targeted therapy.\nMETHODS\nThe study population included older adults (ages 65+) diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic melanoma between 2012 and 2017 and who received first line immunotherapy or targeted therapy. Using the linked surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-medicare data, we described patterns of first line treatment and treatment sequence through 2018. We used descriptive statistics to report patient and provider characteristics by first line treatment receipt and changes in first line therapy use over calendar time. We also described overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) by first line treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. For patterns of treatment sequence, we reported commonly observed treatment switch patterns by treatment sub-category and calendar year.\nRESULTS\nThe analyses included 584 patients (mean age = 76.3 years). A majority (n = 502) received first line immunotherapy. There was a sustained increase in immunotherapy uptake, most notably from 2015 to 2016. The estimated median OS and TTF were longer with first line immunotherapy than with targeted therapy. Individuals treated with CTLA-4 + PD-1 inhibitors had the longest median OS (28.4 months). The most common treatment switch pattern was from a first line CTLA-4 inhibitor to a second line PD-1 inhibitor.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings inform understanding of treatment patterns of currently used immunotherapies and targeted therapies in older adults with advanced melanoma.

Identifying those at increased risk of BrM is of significant public health importance, and our objective was to assess the relationship between atopy and survival or reduced BrM cumulative incidence (CI) in melanoma.\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective study was conducted in individuals (≥66 years) in linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare data. History of atopy diagnosed prior to melanoma was ascertained using International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes. Associations between atopy, CI of BrM, and overall survival were assessed using cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and P values.\nRESULTS\nA total of 23,508 cutaneous melanoma cases were identified. Overall, 6.1% developed BrM, and 38% had history of atopy. Atopy was associated with an 18% decrease in death (P < 0.001). Among those without metastasis at diagnosis, atopy decreased BrM CI by 16% (P = 0.006). Among those with metastasis at diagnosis (any site), only those who received checkpoint inhibitors had a suggestive but nonsignificant survival with atopy.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAtopy confers improved survival and decreased BrM CI. History of atopy in the elderly may identify those with more robust immune function that may be more responsive to treatment.\nIMPACT\nElderly individuals with prior diagnosis of atopy had significantly improved survival and decreased incidence of BrM as compared with individuals without atopy.

Multiple registry/claims studies report large increases in immunotherapy use, particularly from ~2015 onward when PD‑1 agents became widely adopted <cite id=\"37095605\">Lee et al., 2023</cite>.\n\n- Older patients have increasingly received ICIs in routine practice, and real‑world effectiveness is maintained in older adults. SEER‑Medicare analyses found markedly longer median survival with PD‑1 inhibitors versus no systemic therapy (median OS ~34 months with PD‑1) and benefit of ICIs persisted across age groups ≥65 and ≥75 years <cite id=\"33132048\">Howell et al., 2021</cite>.\n\n- Real‑world survival gains approximate clinical‑trial improvements. Studies of older, population‑based cohorts reported longer overall survival and longer time‑to‑treatment‑failure with first‑line immunotherapy versus targeted therapy or chemotherapy; combination CTLA‑4 + PD‑1 regimens had some of the longest observed median OS in these datasets (~28 months in one cohort) <cite id=\"37095605\">Lee et al., 2023</cite>.\n\n- Treatment sequencing patterns in the real world often include switching from CTLA‑4 inhibitors to PD‑1 inhibitors; uptake patterns and sequences have evolved over calendar time as newer agents became available <cite id=\"37095605\">Lee et al., 2023</cite>.\n\n- Emerging safety/long‑term effects at the population level: an analysis covering 2005–2016 reported an increased overall risk of second primary cancers in melanoma survivors in the post‑ICI era versus pre‑ICI era, suggesting altered long‑term patterns of second cancers with contemporary systemic therapy (analysis used SEER data) <cite id=\"33295975\">Deng et al., 2020</cite>.\n\nLimitations and caveats from these population studies:\n- Observational registry/claims analyses are subject to confounding by indication, limited clinical detail (e.g., performance status, BRAF status), and relatively short follow‑up for some newer agents.\n- Population studies often focus on older patients (SEER‑Medicare), so findings may not fully generalize to younger patients.\n- Longer‑term safety and survivorship effects continue to require monitoring as follow‑up lengthens.\n\nBottom line: Over the past decade, population‑level data document a major increase in ICI use for metastatic melanoma (especially PD‑1 agents since ~2015), evolving treatment sequences, and meaningful real‑world survival gains including among older adults, while signals about changing patterns of second primary cancers warrant continued surveillance in survivorship cohorts <cite id=\"37095605\">Lee et al., 2023</cite><cite id=\"33132048\">Howell et al., 2021</cite><cite id=\"33295975\">Deng et al., 2020</cite>.\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "immune checkpoint inhibitors utilization outcomes metastatic melanoma population trends", "result": {"total": 1, "data": [{"paperId": "33295975", "title": "Assessment of Trends in Second Primary Cancers in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma From 2005 to 2016.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nTo date, the risk of developing second primary cancers (SPCs) after the first primary melanoma has not been studied in the era of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess differences in the risk of SPCs in patients with primary melanoma before (2005-2010) and after (2011-2016) the introduction and approval of ICIs.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nPopulation-based cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from January 2005 to December 2016 of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma.

Therefore, identifying patients who could optimally benefit from ICI treatment remains a challenge.\nMETHODS\nAmong 183 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC who received ICI monotherapy, we analyzed 110 patients whose pre- and post-treatment plasma samples were available. Seventy-three soluble immune mediators were measured at ICI initiation and 6 weeks later. To identify useful biomarkers, we analyzed the association of pre-treatment levels and on-treatment changes of soluble immune mediators with survival of patients. The associations of pre-treatment or on-treatment biomarkers with irAE development, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ TIL density, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were also analyzed.\nRESULTS\nUnivariate analysis showed that pre-treatment biomarkers included 6 immune mediators, whereas on-treatment biomarkers included 8 immune mediators. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-treatment biomarkers included 4 immune mediators (CCL19, CCL21, CXCL5, CXCL10), whereas on-treatment biomarkers included 5 immune mediators (CCL7, CCL19, CCL23, CCL25, IL-32). IrAE development was associated with on-treatment change in CCL23. PD-L1 expression was associated with the pre-treatment levels of TNFSF13B and the on-treatment change in CCL25. CD8+ TIL density was associated with the pre-treatment CXCL10 level, whereas NLR was correlated with pre-treatment levels of CCL13 and CCL17.\nCONCLUSION\nWe identified several soluble immune mediators as pre-treatment and on-treatment biomarkers of survival in patients with NSCLC treated with ICI monotherapy. Some of these biomarkers were associated with other possible predictors, including irAE development, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ TIL density and NLR. Further large-scale studies are needed to establish biomarkers for patients with NSCLC who received ICI monotherapy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"41378786\">Title: Prostate tumor immune microenvironment changes following immunotherapy shared by patients who developed anti-tumor response or immune-related adverse events.\nAuthors: Rastogi, Ichwaku, McNeel, Douglas G | Year: 2025 | Journal: Oncoimmunology\nAbstract: Checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, yet their efficacy in prostate cancer has been limited. We previously reported a clinical trial (NCT02499835) evaluating PD-1 blockade combined with an anti-tumor DNA vaccine, pTVG-HP (encoding prostatic acid phosphatase), in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Decreases in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were observed in 35% of patients, and 42% of patients developed immune-related adverse events (irAE). In long-term follow-up, any decrease in PSA or the development of an irAE was associated with prolonged overall survival ( p = 0.009 or p = 0.006, respectively), suggesting a potential association between irAE and anti-tumor immunity. To evaluate this, tumor biopsies obtained pre- and post-treatment from 12 patients were evaluated by gene expression profiling and spatial protein analysis. Clinical responders (those with any decrease in PSA) presented with reduced checkpoint marker expression and increased expression of markers associated with dendritic cells, antigen presentation, and T-cell activation. These gene expression signatures highly overlapped with signatures from patients who experienced an irAE. Conversely, non-responders showed enrichment of immunosuppressive pathways, including elevated expression of VISTA and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-associated markers. Patients without irAE had increased expression of PARP. These findings suggest that patients experiencing irAEs can have immune responses to tumor irrespective of obvious anti-tumor efficacy, at least with these treatments, and underscore the importance of tumor-infiltrating professional antigen presenting cells and T-cell activation for successful immunotherapy. Moreover, our findings suggest that combining vaccines and PD-1 blockade with MDSC-targeting therapies, anti-VISTA, and/or anti-PARP therapies might be further explored.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40659985\">Title: Liquid biopsy using plasma proteomics in predicting efficacy and tolerance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockades in NSCLC: a prospective exploratory study.\nAuthors: Gao, Yuan, Qi, Fei, Zhou, Wenhao et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Molecular biomedicine\nAbstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show limited efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers. Here we prospectively analysed serial plasma samples from 34 ICI-treated advanced NSCLC patients (plus 30 validation samples) using the Olink Immuno-Oncology panel. We assessed dynamic proteomic changes associated with ICI efficacy and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and developed a prognostic model. Following ICIs, 42/92 proteins significantly elevated upon ICI treatment (p < 0.05). Baseline levels of CD28, CXCL10, and TNFSF14, and increased CD40L post-treatment, correlated with inferior response. Baseline IL-4, IL-13 and increased GZMA post-treatment were associated with irAE occurrence. Using LASSO-Cox regression, we established an Immunosuppressive Signature of Combined Resistance Elements (I-SCORE) model based on eight plasma proteins (CCL23, ARG1, CD83, ADA, CXCL10, TNFSF14, CD28, GZMA). I-SCORE demonstrated strong predictive power for overall survival (12-month AUC = 0.94), progression-free survival (12-month AUC = 0.75), and treatment response (AUC = 0.62). Furthermore, a high I-SCORE was demonstrated to reflect an inflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotype, showing positive linear relationships with plasma IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and monocyte count, and negative relationships with IL-33 and active T-cell proportion. Our study identifies I-SCORE, derived from plasma proteomics, as a promising integrated biomarker for predicting ICI outcomes in NSCLC. It suggests targeting specific proteins or the associated immunosuppressive microenvironment might enhance immunotherapy efficacy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39142718\">Title: Case report of fatal immune-mediated myocarditis following treatment with davoceticept (ALPN-202), a PD-L1-dependent CD28 costimulator and dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor, in combination with pembrolizumab.\nAuthors: Cavalcante, Ludimila, Chandana, Sreenivasa, Lakhani, Nehal et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Journal for immunotherapy of cancer\nAbstract: Engagement of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) can interfere with the CD28 signaling requisite for T-cell activation. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can relieve this suppression, they are unable to drive CD28 costimulation that may mechanistically contribute to ICI resistance. Thus, CD28 costimulation in the context of checkpoint inhibition may activate immunosuppressed T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Davoceticept (ALPN-202) is an Fc fusion of a CD80 variant immunoglobulin domain (vIgD) designed to mediate PD-L1-dependent CD28 costimulation while inhibiting the PD-L1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints. PD-L1-restriction of davoceticept's CD28 costimulatory activity may minimize systemic T-cell activation and avoid untoward systemic toxicities. At the same time, preclinical studies have suggested that treatment with davoceticept during PD-1 inhibition may enhance antitumor activity by upregulating PD-L1, potentially synergizing with davoceticept's PD-L1-dependent costimulatory mechanism. This report details two cases of fatal cardiac events following treatment with davoceticept in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in the phase 1 study, NEON-2. Both events occurred in females in their 60s; one with choroidal melanoma and prior immunotherapy, the other with ICI-naïve microsatellite stable colorectal cancer. The clinical courses were fulminant with symptom onset at 2 weeks, followed by rapid decline. Cardiac autopsy from one patient confirmed immune-related myocarditis, and immunosequencing revealed expansion of a single T-cell clone that was not present in the pretreatment tumor. These cases highlight the importance of understanding risk factors that may contribute to immune-related myocarditis and other severe immune-related adverse events when CD28 agonism is targeted in the context of checkpoint inhibition.NEON-2 (NCT04920383).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32253223\">Title: Autoimmune complications of immunotherapy: pathophysiology and management.\nAuthors: Chan, Karmela K, Bass, Anne R | Year: 2020 | Journal: BMJ (Clinical research ed.)\nAbstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies that target inhibitory molecules, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), or its ligand, programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1), and lead to immune activation in the tumor micro-environment. ICIs can induce durable treatment responses in patients with advanced cancers, but they are commonly associated with immune related adverse events (irAEs) such as rash, colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and endocrine and musculoskeletal disorders. Almost all patients experience some form of irAE, but high grade irAEs occur in approximately half of those on combination therapy (eg, anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1), and up to one quarter receiving ICI monotherapy. Fatal irAEs occur in approximately 1.2% of patients on CTLA-4 blockade and 0.4% of patients receiving PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade, and case fatality rates are highest for myocarditis and myositis. IrAEs typically occur in the first three months after ICI initiation, but can occur as early as one day after the first dose to years after ICI initiation. The mainstay of treatment is with corticosteroids, but tumor necrosis factor inhibitors are commonly used for refractory irAEs. Although ICIs are generally discontinued when high grade irAEs occur, ICI discontinuation alone is rarely adequate to resolve irAEs. Consensus guidelines have been published to help guide management, but will likely be modified as our understanding of irAEs grows.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>I will search PubMed for studies linking tumor microenvironment (TME) features to prediction of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) after PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.</think>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">tumor microenvironment irAE predictors PD-1</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

We investigated the association between TIL abundance in pretreatment primary and metastasis specimens and the subsequent development of severe irAEs.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe retrospectively identified patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma who received first-line anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) with or without anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) from 10 hospitals in the Netherlands. TILs were scored on representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains of the primary melanoma and pretreatment melanoma metastasis as 'absent', 'nonbrisk', or 'brisk'. A univariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to assess the association between the TIL scores and the development of severe irAEs. Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to estimate the cumulative incidence of severe irAEs.\nRESULTS\nOf the 1346 eligible patients, 536 patients had primary melanoma specimens available, and 613 patients had metastasis specimens available. Severe irAEs occurred in 15% of anti-PD-1-treated patients and 49% of anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4-treated patients. The presence of TILs was not associated with the occurrence of grade ≥3 irAEs in primary melanoma specimens ( P = 0.70) nor pretreatment metastasis specimens ( P = 0.91). In the univariable analysis, patients with brisk TILs did not have a higher chance of developing severe irAEs compared with patients with absent TILs, for both primary specimen (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.60-2.18) and metastasis specimen (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.37-1.59). There was also no significant difference in the lifetime risk or timing of the development of severe irAEs in patients with TILs present compared with patients with TILs absent.\nCONCLUSION\nThere was no association between the TIL scores on H&E-stained slides from the primary melanoma or pretreatment metastasis and the development of grade 3 or higher irAEs. Additionally, no correlation was found between the presence of TILs and the timing of irAEs.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38661680\">Title: A combined model of serum neutrophil extracellular traps, CD8 + T cells, and tumor proportion score provides better prediction of PD-1 inhibitor efficacy in patients with NSCLC.\nAuthors: Guo, Jian, Shu, Tingting, Zhang, Hao et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: The FEBS journal\nAbstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors provide a definite survival benefit for patients with driver-negative advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but predictors of efficacy are still lacking. There may be a relationship between immune inflammatory state and tumor immune response. We explored the relationship of serum neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) with infiltrating cells in the tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC as well as their relationship with the therapeutic efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors. Serum myeloperoxidase (MPO)-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was detected as a marker of NET serum concentration. T cells were detected by immunohistochemical staining, and neutrophils were counted by MPO immunofluorescence staining. Of the 31 patients with NSCLC, a longer progression-free survival after PD-1 inhibitor treatment was associated with higher levels of CD3 + T cells, a lower neutrophil : CD3 + -T-cell ratio (NEU/CD3 + ) and lower neutrophil : CD8 + -T-cell ratio (NEU/CD8 + ) in tumor tissues. Patients with higher serum NETs were more likely to develop progressive disease after treatment (P = 0.003) and to have immune-related adverse events (IrAEs) as well as higher NEU/CD3 + and NEU/CD8 + . The combined model of serum NETs, CD8 + T cells, and tumor proportion score (TPS) significantly improved the prediction of PD-1 inhibitor efficacy [P = 0.033; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.881]. Our results indicate that serum NETs are effective predictors of PD-1 inhibitor response and reflect the tissue neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and IrAE levels. The combined model of serum NETs, CD8 + T cells, and TPS is a powerful tool for predicting the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor treatment in patients with NSCLC.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40198121\">Title: ICOS+CD4+ T cells define a high susceptibility to anti-PD-1 therapy-induced lung pathogenesis.\nAuthors: Yokoi, Mari, Murakami, Kosaku, Yaguchi, Tomonori et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JCI insight\nAbstract: Managing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by cancer immunotherapy is essential for developing effective and safer therapies. However, cellular mechanism(s) underlying organ toxicity during anti-PD-(L)1 therapy remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of chronological aging on anti-PD-(L)1 therapy-induced irAE-like lung toxicity, utilizing tumor-bearing aged mice. Anti-PD-(L)1 therapy facilitated ectopic infiltration of T and B cells, and antibody deposition in lungs of aged but not young mice. Adoptive transfer of aged lung-derived CD4+ T cells into TCR-deficient mice revealed that both pathogenic CD4+ T cells and an aged host environment were necessary for the irAE-inducible responses. Single-cell transcriptomics of lung-infiltrating cells in aged mice demonstrated that anti-PD-(L)1 therapy elicited ICOS+CD4+ T cell activation. Disruption of the ICOS-ICOSL interaction attenuated germinal center B cell differentiation and subsequent lung damage, which were overcome by local administration of IL-21 in the lungs of anti-PD-1 therapy-treated aged mice. Therefore, ICOS+CD4+ T cells elicited under an aged environment exacerbated aberrant immune responses and the subsequent lung dysfunction. Consistent with the findings from the mouse model, ICOS upregulation in CD4+ T cells was associated with later irAE incidence in patients with cancer. These finding will help development of useful strategies for irAE management in patients with cancer, many of whom are elderly.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38443917\">Title: Comparing anti-tumor and anti-self immunity in a patient with melanoma receiving immune checkpoint blockade.\nAuthors: Chen, Shuming, McMiller, Tracee L, Soni, Abha et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Journal of translational medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nTumor regression following immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is often associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), marked by inflammation in non-cancerous tissues. This study was undertaken to investigate the functional relationship between anti-tumor and anti-self immunity, to facilitate irAE management while promoting anti-tumor immunity.\nMETHODS\nMultiple biopsies from tumor and inflamed tissues were collected from a patient with melanoma experiencing both tumor regression and irAEs on ICB, who underwent rapid autopsy. Immune cells infiltrating melanoma lesions and inflamed normal tissues were subjected to gene expression profiling with multiplex qRT-PCR for 122 candidate genes. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry was conducted to assess the expression of 14 candidate markers of immune cell subsets and checkpoints. TCR-beta sequencing was used to explore T cell clonal repertoires across specimens.\nRESULTS\nWhile genes involved in MHC I/II antigen presentation, IFN signaling, innate immunity and immunosuppression were abundantly expressed across specimens, irAE tissues over-expressed certain genes associated with immunosuppression (CSF1R, IL10RA, IL27/EBI3, FOXP3, KLRG1, SOCS1, TGFB1), including those in the COX-2/PGE2 pathway (IL1B, PTGER1/EP1 and PTGER4/EP4). Immunohistochemistry revealed similar proportions of immunosuppressive cell subsets and checkpoint molecules across samples. TCRseq did not indicate common TCR repertoires across tumor and inflammation sites, arguing against shared antigen recognition between anti-tumor and anti-self immunity in this patient.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis comprehensive study of a single patient with melanoma experiencing both tumor regression and irAEs on ICB explores the immune landscape across these tissues, revealing similarities between anti-tumor and anti-self immunity. Further, it highlights expression of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway, which is known to be immunosuppressive and potentially mediates ICB resistance. Ongoing clinical trials of COX-2/PGE2 pathway inhibitors targeting the major COX-2 inducer IL-1B, COX-2 itself, or the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 present new opportunities to promote anti-tumor activity, but may also have the potential to enhance the severity of ICB-induced irAEs.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35681616\">Title: Pilot Trial of Arginine Deprivation Plus Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Patients with Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.\nAuthors: Kraehenbuehl, Lukas, Holland, Aliya, Armstrong, Emma et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Cancers\nAbstract: Metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) remains challenging to treat, with objective response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) being much lower than in primary cutaneous melanoma (CM). Besides a lower mutational burden, the overall immune-excluded tumor microenvironment of UM might contribute to the poor response rate. We therefore aimed at targeting deficiency in argininosuccinate synthase 1, which is a key metabolic feature of UM. This study aims at investigating the safety and tolerability of a triple combination consisting of ipilimumab and nivolumab immunotherapy and the metabolic therapy, ADI-PEG 20. Nine patients were enrolled in this pilot study. The combination therapy was safe and tolerable with an absence of immune-related adverse events (irAE) of special interest, but with four of nine patients experiencing a CTCAE grade 3 AE. No objective responses were observed. All except one patient developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA) within a month of the treatment initiation and therefore did not maintain arginine depletion. Further, an IFNg-dependent inflammatory signature was observed in metastatic lesions in patients pre-treated with ICB compared with patients with no pretreatment. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated variable presence of tumor infiltrating CD8 lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression at the baseline in metastases.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>Short answer\nThere is no single, universally validated tumor‑microenvironment (TME) biomarker that reliably predicts immune‑related adverse events (irAEs) after PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade. Current literature points to a set of TME‑linked signals — especially dynamic (on‑treatment) soluble mediators, T‑cell activation phenotypes, neutrophil/neutrophil‑extracellular‑trap (NET) signatures and APC/T cell activation features — that are most consistently associated with subsequent irAEs, but findings are heterogeneous and require prospective validation.\n\nWhich TME biomarkers have the strongest/most consistent support\n- Dynamic chemokines and soluble mediators (measured in plasma or tumor interstitial fluid). On‑treatment increases in certain chemokines (notably CCL23) and changes in other CC/CXCL family members have been associated with irAE development in NSCLC cohorts. These are most informative when compared pre‑ and on‑treatment rather than as single baseline values <cite id=\"39235457\">39235457</cite>.\n- Plasma cytokine/proteomic signatures. Proteomic panels have linked baseline IL‑4/IL‑13 and post‑treatment increases in cytotoxic markers (e.g., GZMA) with irAE occurrence; multivariate proteomic “scores” (integrating several proteins) can improve prediction but need external validation <cite id=\"40659985\">40659985</cite>.\n- Activated/ICOS+ CD4+ T cells in tissue. Upregulation/expansion of ICOS+ CD4+ T cells in organs (and in peripheral blood in some cohorts) has been associated with higher susceptibility to organ‑specific irAEs (example: therapy‑induced lung injury) <cite id=\"40198121\">40198121</cite>.\n- Neutrophil biology and NETs, and high intratumoral neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios. Elevated circulating NET markers and a high tumor neutrophil:CD8 (or neutrophil:total T cell) ratio have been associated with both poorer anti‑tumor responses and higher irAE rates in small NSCLC series <cite id=\"38661680\">38661680</cite>.\n- Features of antigen‑presenting cells and T‑cell activation (spatial/ transcriptional signatures).

To evaluate this, tumor biopsies obtained pre- and post-treatment from 12 patients were evaluated by gene expression profiling and spatial protein analysis. Clinical responders (those with any decrease in PSA) presented with reduced checkpoint marker expression and increased expression of markers associated with dendritic cells, antigen presentation, and T-cell activation.

Thus, CD28 costimulation in the context of checkpoint inhibition may activate immunosuppressed T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.
