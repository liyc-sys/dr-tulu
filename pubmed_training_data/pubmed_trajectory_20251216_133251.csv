It contains human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells edited ex vivo by CRISPR/Cas9 (a DNA double strand break-inducing nuclease system) to differentiate into erythroid cells that produce high levels of foetal hemoglobin. Developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, exagamglogene autotemcel received its first approval on 16 November 2023 in the UK for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) in patients aged ≥ 12 years for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. On the same day, it was also approved in the UK for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients aged ≥ 12 years with recurrent vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) who have the β S /β S , β S /β + or β S /β 0 genotype for whom HSC transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. Subsequently, exagamglogene autotemcel was approved in the USA on 8 December 2023 for the treatment of SCD in patients aged ≥ 12 years with recurrent VOCs and received a positive opinion in the EU on 14 December 2023 for the treatment of TDT and SCD. A regulatory assessment of exagamglogene autotemcel is currently underway for the treatment of TDT in the USA.

Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was the only curative approach. Based on the Crispr-Cas9-technology enabling targeting specific genes of interest, fetal hemoglobin which is normally shut-off after birth can be switched on and sufficient levels can alleviate symptoms in sickle cell disease and avoid transfusions in beta-thalassemia. Two first-in-human clinical studies in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia aiming to increase the level of fetal hemoglobin by using Crispr-Cas9 to modify autologous hematopoietic stem cells in patients aged 12-35 years have proved safety and efficacy and have shown promising clinical outcomes.\nAREAS COVERED\nThe paper summarizes the outcome of the results of the two recently published clinical studies and compares them with the other available curative approaches.\nEXPERT OPINION\nBased on the currently available safety and efficacy data of the two published clinical results on gene therapy with Crispr-Cas9 modified autologous stem cells (exagamglogene autotemcel), it can be anticipated that this approach will add significantly to the therapeutic options for patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia and can be considered for all patients above 12 years of age independent of a suitable allogeneic stem cell donor.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">betibeglogene autotemcel thalassemia trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 7 results.

Patients underwent myeloablation with busulfan (with doses adjusted on the basis of pharmacokinetic analysis) and received beti-cel intravenously. The primary end point was transfusion independence (i.e., a weighted average hemoglobin level of ≥9 g per deciliter without red-cell transfusions for ≥12 months).\nRESULTS\nA total of 23 patients were enrolled and received treatment, with a median follow-up of 29.5 months (range, 13.0 to 48.2). Transfusion independence occurred in 20 of 22 patients who could be evaluated (91%), including 6 of 7 patients (86%) who were younger than 12 years of age. The average hemoglobin level during transfusion independence was 11.7 g per deciliter (range, 9.5 to 12.8). Twelve months after beti-cel infusion, the median level of gene therapy-derived adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbA T87Q ) was 8.7 g per deciliter (range, 5.2 to 10.6) in patients who had transfusion independence. The safety profile of beti-cel was consistent with that of busulfan-based myeloablation. Four patients had at least one adverse event that was considered by the investigators to be related or possibly related to beti-cel; all events were nonserious except for thrombocytopenia (in 1 patient). No cases of cancer were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with beti-cel resulted in a sustained HbA T87Q level and a total hemoglobin level that was high enough to enable transfusion independence in most patients with a non-β 0 /β 0 genotype, including those younger than 12 years of age.

Betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) gene therapy uses autologous haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced with BB305 lentiviral vector to enable transfusion independence.\nMETHODS\nHGB-212 was a non-randomised, multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study of beti-cel in patients with TDT conducted at eight centres in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the UK, and the USA. Patients with β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β +IVS-I-110 , or β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 genotypes, clinically stable TDT, and a transfusion history of at least 100 mL/kg per year of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) or at least eight transfusions of pRBCs per year in the 2 years before enrolment were eligible for participation. After undergoing HSPC mobilisation and busulfan-based, pharmacokinetic-adjusted myeloablative conditioning, patients were infused with beti-cel and followed up for 24 months. The primary efficacy outcome was transfusion independence, defined as weighted average haemoglobin level of 9 g/dL or above without pRBC transfusions for 12 or more months. The primary outcome was measured in all patients who received an infusion of beti-cel (transplant population); safety was evaluated in all patients who initiated study treatment (intention-to-treat population). Patients were eligible to enrol in the ongoing 13-year long-term follow-up study (for a total of 15 years), LTF-303 (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02633943). This trial, HGB-212, was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03207009), and is complete.\nFINDINGS\nFrom June 8, 2017, to March 12, 2020, 20 patients were screened for eligibility. One patient was ineligible and one withdrew consent before HSPC mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning. Of the 18 patients who received beti-cel, ten (56%) were male and eight (44%) were female; 13 (72%) were younger than 18 years at the time of informed consent, and five (28%) were older than 18 years. 12 (67%) patients had β 0 /β 0 genotypes, three (17%) had β 0 / β +IVS-I-110 , and three (17%) had β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 . As of Jan 30, 2023, all patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study and the median follow-up was 47·9 months (range 23·8-59·0). All 18 patients were evaluable for transfusion independence, with 16 (89%) of 18 reaching and maintaining transfusion independence to last follow=up (estimated effect size 89·9% [95% CI 65·3-98·6]). All patients had at least one adverse event after beti-cel infusion. There were no serious adverse events considered to be related to beti-cel, and no deaths.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese data demonstrate that beti-cel can allow patients with genotypes that cause severe β-thalassaemia (β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β +IVS-I-110 , or β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 ) to reach transfusion independence. Beti-cel offers the potential to attain near-normal haemoglobin levels for those with severe forms of TDT, and a potentially curative option without the risks and limitations of allogeneic HSPC transplantation. Patients are being followed up for a total of 15 years to assess the durability of transfusion independence and long-term safety profile of beti-cel.\nFUNDING\nBluebird Bio, Somerville, MA, USA.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""36997768\"">Title: Therapeutic perspective for children and young adults living with thalassemia and sickle cell disease.\nAuthors: Ferraresi, Marta, Panzieri, Daniele Lello, Leoni, Simona et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: European journal of pediatrics\nAbstract: Hemoglobinopathies, including thalassemias and sickle cell disease, are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, with estimated annual births of more than 330,000 affected infants. Hemoglobin disorders account for about 3.4% of deaths in children under 5 years of age. The distribution of these diseases is historically linked to current or previously malaria-endemic regions; however, immigration has led to a worldwide distribution of these diseases, making them a global health problem. During the last decade, new treatment approaches and novel therapies have been proposed, some of which have the potential to change the natural history of these disorders. Indeed, the first erythroid maturation agent, luspatercept, and gene therapy have been approved for beta-thalassemia adult patients. For sickle cell disease, molecules targeting vaso-occlusion and hemoglobin S polymerization include crizanlizumab, which has been approved for patients ≥ 16 years, voxelotor approved for patients ≥ 12 years, and L-glutamine for patients older than 5 years.    Conclusion: We herein present the most recent advances and future perspectives in thalassemia and sickle cell disease treatment, including new drugs, gene therapy, and gene editing, and the current clinical trial status in the pediatric populations. What is Known: • Red blood cell transfusions, iron chelation therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been the mainstay of treatment of thalassemia patients for decades. • For sickle cell disease, until 2005, treatment strategies were mostly the same as those for thalassemia, with the option of simple transfusion or exchange transfusion. In 2007, hydroxyurea was approved for patients ≥ 2 years old. What is New: • In 2019, gene therapy with betibeglogene autotemcel (LentiGlobin BB305) was approved for TDT patients ≥ 12 years old non β0/β0 without matched sibling donor. • Starting from 2017 several new drugs, such as L-glutamine (approved only by FDA), crizanlizumab (approved by FDA and EMA for patients ≥ 16 years), and lastly voxelotor (approved by FDA and EMA for patients ≥ 12 years old).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38074412\"">Title: Drug product attributes predict clinical efficacy in betibeglogene autotemcel gene therapy for β-thalassemia.\nAuthors: Whitney, Dustin, Shestopalov, Ilya, Fincker, Maeva et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development\nAbstract: Ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell lentiviral-based gene therapy with betibeglogene autotemcel has been studied in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia in Phase III clinical trials (HGB-207 and HGB-212), with 90% of patients reaching transfusion independence (TI). Here, we explore manufacturing parameters, drug product quality attributes, and limited patient characteristics that had an impact on clinical efficacy in HGB-207 and HGB-212. Retrospective analysis revealed that the peripheral blood vector copy number (VCN) was related to TI, with a strong correlation between peripheral blood VCN at 6 months and gene therapy-derived therapeutic protein (HbA T87Q ) expression at 6 months (correlation coefficient, 0.8681; p < 0.0001; R 2 = 0.7536). A peripheral blood VCN threshold of ≥0.75 copies per diploid genome at 6 months post betibeglogene autotemcel infusion provided a stringent surrogate biomarker for TI and was used as the outcome variable for multivariate analysis using a random forest classifier. The top predictive feature of clinical efficacy was found to be the percentage of lentiviral vector-positive cells in the drug product. This retrospective analysis is critical to understanding the key product quality attributes that can predict clinical efficacy in lentiviral vector gene therapy within this clinical trial population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34178295\"">Title: Economic evaluation of betibeglogene autotemcel (Beti-cel) gene addition therapy in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.\nAuthors: Kansal, Anuraag R, Reifsnider, Odette S, Brand, Sarah B et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Journal of market access & health policy\nAbstract: Background : Standard of care (SoC) for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) requires lifelong, regular blood transfusions as well as chelation to reduce iron accumulation. Objective : This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of betibeglogene autotemcel ('beti-cel'; LentiGlobin for β-thalassemia) one-time, gene addition therapy compared to lifelong SoC for TDT. Study design : Microsimulation model simulated the lifetime course of TDT based on a causal sequence in which transfusion requirements determine tissue iron levels, which in turn determine risk of iron overload complications that increase mortality. Clinical trial data informed beti-cel clinical parameters; effects of SoC on iron levels came from real-world studies; iron overload complication rates and mortality were based on published literature. Setting : USA; commercial payer perspective Participants : TDT patients age 2-50 Interventions : Beti-cel is compared to SoC. Main outcome measure : Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) utilizing quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) Results : The model predicts beti-cel adds 3.8 discounted life years (LYs) or 6.9 QALYs versus SoC. Discounted lifetime costs were $2.28 M for beti-cel ($572,107 if excluding beti-cel cost) and $2.04 M for SoC, with a resulting ICER of $34,833 per QALY gained. Conclusion : Beti-cel is cost-effective for TDT patients compared to SoC. This is due to longer survival and cost offset of lifelong SoC.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">CTX001 thalassemia CRISPR trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 11 results.

Clinical presentation varies depending on the genotype, ranging from a silent or mild carrier state to severe, transfusion-dependent or lethal disease. Management of patients with α-thalassemia is primarily supportive, addressing either symptoms (eg, RBC transfusions for anemia), complications of the disease, or its transfusion-dependence (eg, chelation therapy for iron overload). Several novel therapies are also in development, including curative gene manipulation techniques and disease modifying agents that target ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolytic anemia. This review of α-thalassemia and its various manifestations provides practical information for clinicians who practice beyond those regions where it is found with high frequency.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38657265\"">Title: Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia.\nAuthors: Locatelli, Franco, Lang, Peter, Wall, Donna et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nExagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) is a nonviral cell therapy designed to reactivate fetal hemoglobin synthesis through ex vivo clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing of the erythroid-specific enhancer region of BCL11A in autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an open-label, single-group, phase 3 study of exa-cel in patients 12 to 35 years of age with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and a β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β 0 -like, or non-β 0 /β 0 -like genotype.

In this article, we discuss the importance of carrier, prenatal, and newborn screening for thalassemia. We examine the rationale for who should be screened and when, as well as the current methodology for screening. Deficiencies in the newborn screening program are highlighted as well. With the advent of inexpensive and rapid genetic testing, this may be the most practical method of screening in the future, and we review the implications of population-based implementation of this strategy.

Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023479511). Trials from seven databases' (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Registry, ISRCTN registry, ICTRP/trialsearch.who.int, ChiCTR.org.cn, Clinical Trial Registry India, and Cochrane Library/Trials) inception to 9 March 2024, were considered. Exclusion criteria were unrelated, duplicated, non-English, unavailable full texts, diagnostic studies, correlational studies, observational studies, abstract-only papers, reviews or conference papers. Included studies were appraised using the ten-item CASP tool to assess methodological quality. The review identified 82 RCTs utilizing CRISPR and revealed four main themes: Diseases targeted, Countries of Clinical trials, Type of interventions, and Trial trends over the years. Geographically, the United States and China lead in the number of CRISPR clinical trials, followed by the European Union. However, Africa, Asia, and South America have very few trials. Among disease classes, cancer is the most prevalent focus with 39 studies, followed by monogenetic blood diseases, like Thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The biological agent CTX001 and Cyclophosphamide each feature in 11 studies. The peak year for clinical trials was 2018, marked by a significant increase with 16 studies conducted. Despite conducting a comprehensive search, the majority of trials were concentrated in the United States and China. Additionally, potential oversights due to vague titles, English-only studies, and indexing issues may have occurred. Nonetheless, by incorporating data from seven distinct databases, this review significantly contributes to understanding CRISPR's utilization in therapeutic clinical trials, paving the way for future research directions. The review underscores the burgeoning interest in CRISPR-based interventions. Current trials barely tap CRISPR's potential for treating genetic diseases.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34889443\"">Title: β-Thalassemia: evolving treatment options beyond transfusion and iron chelation.\nAuthors: Langer, Arielle L, Esrick, Erica B | Year: 2021 | Journal: Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program\nAbstract: After years of reliance on transfusion alone to address anemia and suppress ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia, many new therapies are now in development. Luspatercept, a transforming growth factor-β inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing ineffective erythropoiesis, improving anemia, and possibly reducing iron loading. However, many patients do not respond to luspatercept, so additional therapeutics are needed. Several medications in development aim to induce hemoglobin F (HbF): sirolimus, benserazide, and IMR-687 (a phosphodiesterase 9 inhibitor). Another group of agents seeks to ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis and improve anemia by targeting abnormal iron metabolism in thalassemia: apotransferrin, VIT-2763 (a ferroportin inhibitor), PTG-300 (a hepcidin mimetic), and an erythroferrone antibody in early development. Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator, represents a unique mechanism to mitigate ineffective erythropoiesis. Genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers the potential for lifelong transfusion independence. Through a gene addition approach, lentiviral vectors have been used to introduce a β-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. One such product, betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel), has reached phase 3 trials with promising results. In addition, 2 gene editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9 and zinc-finger nucleases) are under investigation as a means to silence BCL11A to induce HbF with agents designated CTX001 and ST-400, respectively.

CD34+ HSPCs were edited by means of CRISPR-Cas9 with a guide mRNA. Before the exa-cel infusion, patients underwent myeloablative conditioning with pharmacokinetically dose-adjusted busulfan. The primary end point was transfusion independence, defined as a weighted average hemoglobin level of 9 g per deciliter or higher without red-cell transfusion for at least 12 consecutive months. Total and fetal hemoglobin concentrations and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS\nA total of 52 patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia received exa-cel and were included in this prespecified interim analysis; the median follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 2.1 to 48.1). Neutrophils and platelets engrafted in each patient. Among the 35 patients with sufficient follow-up data for evaluation, transfusion independence occurred in 32 (91%; 95% confidence interval, 77 to 98; P<0.001 against the null hypothesis of a 50% response). During transfusion independence, the mean total hemoglobin level was 13.1 g per deciliter and the mean fetal hemoglobin level was 11.9 g per deciliter, and fetal hemoglobin had a pancellular distribution (≥94% of red cells). The safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with that of myeloablative busulfan conditioning and autologous HSPC transplantation. No deaths or cancers occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with exa-cel, preceded by myeloablation, resulted in transfusion independence in 91% of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.

It contains human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells edited ex vivo by CRISPR/Cas9 (a DNA double strand break-inducing nuclease system) to differentiate into erythroid cells that produce high levels of foetal hemoglobin. Developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, exagamglogene autotemcel received its first approval on 16 November 2023 in the UK for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) in patients aged ≥ 12 years for whom haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. On the same day, it was also approved in the UK for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in patients aged ≥ 12 years with recurrent vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) who have the β S /β S , β S /β + or β S /β 0 genotype for whom HSC transplantation is appropriate and a human leukocyte antigen matched related HSC donor is not available. Subsequently, exagamglogene autotemcel was approved in the USA on 8 December 2023 for the treatment of SCD in patients aged ≥ 12 years with recurrent VOCs and received a positive opinion in the EU on 14 December 2023 for the treatment of TDT and SCD. A regulatory assessment of exagamglogene autotemcel is currently underway for the treatment of TDT in the USA.

Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was the only curative approach. Based on the Crispr-Cas9-technology enabling targeting specific genes of interest, fetal hemoglobin which is normally shut-off after birth can be switched on and sufficient levels can alleviate symptoms in sickle cell disease and avoid transfusions in beta-thalassemia. Two first-in-human clinical studies in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia aiming to increase the level of fetal hemoglobin by using Crispr-Cas9 to modify autologous hematopoietic stem cells in patients aged 12-35 years have proved safety and efficacy and have shown promising clinical outcomes.\nAREAS COVERED\nThe paper summarizes the outcome of the results of the two recently published clinical studies and compares them with the other available curative approaches.\nEXPERT OPINION\nBased on the currently available safety and efficacy data of the two published clinical results on gene therapy with Crispr-Cas9 modified autologous stem cells (exagamglogene autotemcel), it can be anticipated that this approach will add significantly to the therapeutic options for patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia and can be considered for all patients above 12 years of age independent of a suitable allogeneic stem cell donor.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">betibeglogene autotemcel thalassemia trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 7 results.

Patients underwent myeloablation with busulfan (with doses adjusted on the basis of pharmacokinetic analysis) and received beti-cel intravenously. The primary end point was transfusion independence (i.e., a weighted average hemoglobin level of ≥9 g per deciliter without red-cell transfusions for ≥12 months).\nRESULTS\nA total of 23 patients were enrolled and received treatment, with a median follow-up of 29.5 months (range, 13.0 to 48.2). Transfusion independence occurred in 20 of 22 patients who could be evaluated (91%), including 6 of 7 patients (86%) who were younger than 12 years of age. The average hemoglobin level during transfusion independence was 11.7 g per deciliter (range, 9.5 to 12.8). Twelve months after beti-cel infusion, the median level of gene therapy-derived adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbA T87Q ) was 8.7 g per deciliter (range, 5.2 to 10.6) in patients who had transfusion independence. The safety profile of beti-cel was consistent with that of busulfan-based myeloablation. Four patients had at least one adverse event that was considered by the investigators to be related or possibly related to beti-cel; all events were nonserious except for thrombocytopenia (in 1 patient). No cases of cancer were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with beti-cel resulted in a sustained HbA T87Q level and a total hemoglobin level that was high enough to enable transfusion independence in most patients with a non-β 0 /β 0 genotype, including those younger than 12 years of age.

Betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) gene therapy uses autologous haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced with BB305 lentiviral vector to enable transfusion independence.\nMETHODS\nHGB-212 was a non-randomised, multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study of beti-cel in patients with TDT conducted at eight centres in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the UK, and the USA. Patients with β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β +IVS-I-110 , or β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 genotypes, clinically stable TDT, and a transfusion history of at least 100 mL/kg per year of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) or at least eight transfusions of pRBCs per year in the 2 years before enrolment were eligible for participation. After undergoing HSPC mobilisation and busulfan-based, pharmacokinetic-adjusted myeloablative conditioning, patients were infused with beti-cel and followed up for 24 months. The primary efficacy outcome was transfusion independence, defined as weighted average haemoglobin level of 9 g/dL or above without pRBC transfusions for 12 or more months. The primary outcome was measured in all patients who received an infusion of beti-cel (transplant population); safety was evaluated in all patients who initiated study treatment (intention-to-treat population). Patients were eligible to enrol in the ongoing 13-year long-term follow-up study (for a total of 15 years), LTF-303 (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02633943). This trial, HGB-212, was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03207009), and is complete.\nFINDINGS\nFrom June 8, 2017, to March 12, 2020, 20 patients were screened for eligibility. One patient was ineligible and one withdrew consent before HSPC mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning. Of the 18 patients who received beti-cel, ten (56%) were male and eight (44%) were female; 13 (72%) were younger than 18 years at the time of informed consent, and five (28%) were older than 18 years. 12 (67%) patients had β 0 /β 0 genotypes, three (17%) had β 0 / β +IVS-I-110 , and three (17%) had β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 . As of Jan 30, 2023, all patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study and the median follow-up was 47·9 months (range 23·8-59·0). All 18 patients were evaluable for transfusion independence, with 16 (89%) of 18 reaching and maintaining transfusion independence to last follow=up (estimated effect size 89·9% [95% CI 65·3-98·6]). All patients had at least one adverse event after beti-cel infusion. There were no serious adverse events considered to be related to beti-cel, and no deaths.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese data demonstrate that beti-cel can allow patients with genotypes that cause severe β-thalassaemia (β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β +IVS-I-110 , or β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 ) to reach transfusion independence. Beti-cel offers the potential to attain near-normal haemoglobin levels for those with severe forms of TDT, and a potentially curative option without the risks and limitations of allogeneic HSPC transplantation. Patients are being followed up for a total of 15 years to assess the durability of transfusion independence and long-term safety profile of beti-cel.\nFUNDING\nBluebird Bio, Somerville, MA, USA.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""36997768\"">Title: Therapeutic perspective for children and young adults living with thalassemia and sickle cell disease.\nAuthors: Ferraresi, Marta, Panzieri, Daniele Lello, Leoni, Simona et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: European journal of pediatrics\nAbstract: Hemoglobinopathies, including thalassemias and sickle cell disease, are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, with estimated annual births of more than 330,000 affected infants. Hemoglobin disorders account for about 3.4% of deaths in children under 5 years of age. The distribution of these diseases is historically linked to current or previously malaria-endemic regions; however, immigration has led to a worldwide distribution of these diseases, making them a global health problem. During the last decade, new treatment approaches and novel therapies have been proposed, some of which have the potential to change the natural history of these disorders. Indeed, the first erythroid maturation agent, luspatercept, and gene therapy have been approved for beta-thalassemia adult patients. For sickle cell disease, molecules targeting vaso-occlusion and hemoglobin S polymerization include crizanlizumab, which has been approved for patients ≥ 16 years, voxelotor approved for patients ≥ 12 years, and L-glutamine for patients older than 5 years.    Conclusion: We herein present the most recent advances and future perspectives in thalassemia and sickle cell disease treatment, including new drugs, gene therapy, and gene editing, and the current clinical trial status in the pediatric populations. What is Known: • Red blood cell transfusions, iron chelation therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been the mainstay of treatment of thalassemia patients for decades. • For sickle cell disease, until 2005, treatment strategies were mostly the same as those for thalassemia, with the option of simple transfusion or exchange transfusion. In 2007, hydroxyurea was approved for patients ≥ 2 years old. What is New: • In 2019, gene therapy with betibeglogene autotemcel (LentiGlobin BB305) was approved for TDT patients ≥ 12 years old non β0/β0 without matched sibling donor. • Starting from 2017 several new drugs, such as L-glutamine (approved only by FDA), crizanlizumab (approved by FDA and EMA for patients ≥ 16 years), and lastly voxelotor (approved by FDA and EMA for patients ≥ 12 years old).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38074412\"">Title: Drug product attributes predict clinical efficacy in betibeglogene autotemcel gene therapy for β-thalassemia.\nAuthors: Whitney, Dustin, Shestopalov, Ilya, Fincker, Maeva et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Molecular therapy.

Here, we explore manufacturing parameters, drug product quality attributes, and limited patient characteristics that had an impact on clinical efficacy in HGB-207 and HGB-212. Retrospective analysis revealed that the peripheral blood vector copy number (VCN) was related to TI, with a strong correlation between peripheral blood VCN at 6 months and gene therapy-derived therapeutic protein (HbA T87Q ) expression at 6 months (correlation coefficient, 0.8681; p < 0.0001; R 2 = 0.7536). A peripheral blood VCN threshold of ≥0.75 copies per diploid genome at 6 months post betibeglogene autotemcel infusion provided a stringent surrogate biomarker for TI and was used as the outcome variable for multivariate analysis using a random forest classifier. The top predictive feature of clinical efficacy was found to be the percentage of lentiviral vector-positive cells in the drug product. This retrospective analysis is critical to understanding the key product quality attributes that can predict clinical efficacy in lentiviral vector gene therapy within this clinical trial population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34178295\"">Title: Economic evaluation of betibeglogene autotemcel (Beti-cel) gene addition therapy in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.\nAuthors: Kansal, Anuraag R, Reifsnider, Odette S, Brand, Sarah B et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Journal of market access & health policy\nAbstract: Background : Standard of care (SoC) for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) requires lifelong, regular blood transfusions as well as chelation to reduce iron accumulation. Objective : This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of betibeglogene autotemcel ('beti-cel'; LentiGlobin for β-thalassemia) one-time, gene addition therapy compared to lifelong SoC for TDT. Study design : Microsimulation model simulated the lifetime course of TDT based on a causal sequence in which transfusion requirements determine tissue iron levels, which in turn determine risk of iron overload complications that increase mortality. Clinical trial data informed beti-cel clinical parameters; effects of SoC on iron levels came from real-world studies; iron overload complication rates and mortality were based on published literature. Setting : USA; commercial payer perspective Participants : TDT patients age 2-50 Interventions : Beti-cel is compared to SoC. Main outcome measure : Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) utilizing quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) Results : The model predicts beti-cel adds 3.8 discounted life years (LYs) or 6.9 QALYs versus SoC. Discounted lifetime costs were $2.28 M for beti-cel ($572,107 if excluding beti-cel cost) and $2.04 M for SoC, with a resulting ICER of $34,833 per QALY gained. Conclusion : Beti-cel is cost-effective for TDT patients compared to SoC. This is due to longer survival and cost offset of lifelong SoC.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">CTX001 thalassemia CRISPR trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 11 results.

Clinical presentation varies depending on the genotype, ranging from a silent or mild carrier state to severe, transfusion-dependent or lethal disease. Management of patients with α-thalassemia is primarily supportive, addressing either symptoms (eg, RBC transfusions for anemia), complications of the disease, or its transfusion-dependence (eg, chelation therapy for iron overload). Several novel therapies are also in development, including curative gene manipulation techniques and disease modifying agents that target ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolytic anemia. This review of α-thalassemia and its various manifestations provides practical information for clinicians who practice beyond those regions where it is found with high frequency.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38657265\"">Title: Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia.\nAuthors: Locatelli, Franco, Lang, Peter, Wall, Donna et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nExagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) is a nonviral cell therapy designed to reactivate fetal hemoglobin synthesis through ex vivo clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 gene editing of the erythroid-specific enhancer region of BCL11A in autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an open-label, single-group, phase 3 study of exa-cel in patients 12 to 35 years of age with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and a β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β 0 -like, or non-β 0 /β 0 -like genotype. CD34+ HSPCs were edited by means of CRISPR-Cas9 with a guide mRNA. Before the exa-cel infusion, patients underwent myeloablative conditioning with pharmacokinetically dose-adjusted busulfan. The primary end point was transfusion independence, defined as a weighted average hemoglobin level of 9 g per deciliter or higher without red-cell transfusion for at least 12 consecutive months. Total and fetal hemoglobin concentrations and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS\nA total of 52 patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia received exa-cel and were included in this prespecified interim analysis; the median follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 2.1 to 48.1). Neutrophils and platelets engrafted in each patient. Among the 35 patients with sufficient follow-up data for evaluation, transfusion independence occurred in 32 (91%; 95% confidence interval, 77 to 98; P<0.001 against the null hypothesis of a 50% response). During transfusion independence, the mean total hemoglobin level was 13.1 g per deciliter and the mean fetal hemoglobin level was 11.9 g per deciliter, and fetal hemoglobin had a pancellular distribution (≥94% of red cells). The safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with that of myeloablative busulfan conditioning and autologous HSPC transplantation. No deaths or cancers occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with exa-cel, preceded by myeloablation, resulted in transfusion independence in 91% of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.

American Society of Hematology. Education Program\nAbstract: The thalassemias are inherited quantitative disorders of hemoglobin synthesis with a significant worldwide burden, which result in a wide spectrum of disease from the most severe transfusion-dependent form to the mildest asymptomatic carrier state. In this article, we discuss the importance of carrier, prenatal, and newborn screening for thalassemia. We examine the rationale for who should be screened and when, as well as the current methodology for screening. Deficiencies in the newborn screening program are highlighted as well. With the advent of inexpensive and rapid genetic testing, this may be the most practical method of screening in the future, and we review the implications of population-based implementation of this strategy. Finally, a case-based overview of the approach for individuals with the trait as well as prospective parents who have a potential fetal risk of the disease is outlined.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""39659430\"">Title: CRISPR CLIP: comprehensive reviews on interventional studies using precision recombinant technologies: clinical landmarks, implications, and prospects.\nAuthors: Chodnekar, Swarali Yatin, Tsetskhladze, Zurab | Year: 2024 | Journal: Oxford open immunology\nAbstract: To consolidate clinical trials that utilized the CRISPR technology to synthesise cures for various genetic diseases as a means to provide a window into the progress made so far while paving the way forward for future research and practices. Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023479511). Trials from seven databases' (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Registry, ISRCTN registry, ICTRP/trialsearch.who.int, ChiCTR.org.cn, Clinical Trial Registry India, and Cochrane Library/Trials) inception to 9 March 2024, were considered. Exclusion criteria were unrelated, duplicated, non-English, unavailable full texts, diagnostic studies, correlational studies, observational studies, abstract-only papers, reviews or conference papers. Included studies were appraised using the ten-item CASP tool to assess methodological quality. The review identified 82 RCTs utilizing CRISPR and revealed four main themes: Diseases targeted, Countries of Clinical trials, Type of interventions, and Trial trends over the years. Geographically, the United States and China lead in the number of CRISPR clinical trials, followed by the European Union. However, Africa, Asia, and South America have very few trials. Among disease classes, cancer is the most prevalent focus with 39 studies, followed by monogenetic blood diseases, like Thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The biological agent CTX001 and Cyclophosphamide each feature in 11 studies. The peak year for clinical trials was 2018, marked by a significant increase with 16 studies conducted. Despite conducting a comprehensive search, the majority of trials were concentrated in the United States and China. Additionally, potential oversights due to vague titles, English-only studies, and indexing issues may have occurred. Nonetheless, by incorporating data from seven distinct databases, this review significantly contributes to understanding CRISPR's utilization in therapeutic clinical trials, paving the way for future research directions. The review underscores the burgeoning interest in CRISPR-based interventions. Current trials barely tap CRISPR's potential for treating genetic diseases.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34889443\"">Title: β-Thalassemia: evolving treatment options beyond transfusion and iron chelation.\nAuthors: Langer, Arielle L, Esrick, Erica B | Year: 2021 | Journal: Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program\nAbstract: After years of reliance on transfusion alone to address anemia and suppress ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia, many new therapies are now in development. Luspatercept, a transforming growth factor-β inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing ineffective erythropoiesis, improving anemia, and possibly reducing iron loading. However, many patients do not respond to luspatercept, so additional therapeutics are needed. Several medications in development aim to induce hemoglobin F (HbF): sirolimus, benserazide, and IMR-687 (a phosphodiesterase 9 inhibitor). Another group of agents seeks to ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis and improve anemia by targeting abnormal iron metabolism in thalassemia: apotransferrin, VIT-2763 (a ferroportin inhibitor), PTG-300 (a hepcidin mimetic), and an erythroferrone antibody in early development. Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator, represents a unique mechanism to mitigate ineffective erythropoiesis. Genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers the potential for lifelong transfusion independence. Through a gene addition approach, lentiviral vectors have been used to introduce a β-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. One such product, betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel), has reached phase 3 trials with promising results. In addition, 2 gene editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9 and zinc-finger nucleases) are under investigation as a means to silence BCL11A to induce HbF with agents designated CTX001 and ST-400, respectively. Results from the many clinical trials for these agents will yield results in the next few years, which may end the era of relying on transfusion alone as the mainstay of thalassemia therapy.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""browse_webpage\"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38657265/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""google_search\"">38657265 exagamglogene autotemcel grade 3 adverse events</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\n<snippet id=\""G1\"">Title: Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Transfusion-Dependent β- ...\nby F Locatelli · 2024 · Cited by 153 — Treatment with exa-cel, preceded by myeloablation, resulted in transfusion independence in 91% of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.Read more\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38657265/</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""G2\"">Title: Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events after Exa-Cel Infusion.\nA total of 42 patients (95%) also had adverse events of grade 3 or 4, the most common of which were stomatitis (in 55% of the patients), febrile neutropenia (in ...Read more\nURL: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Grade-3-or-4-Adverse-Events-after-Exa-Cel-Infusion_tbl3_380089373</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""G3\"">Title: Exagamglogene Autotemcel for Transfusion-Dependent β- ...\nMost common AEs were febrile neutropenia (61.5%), headache (53.8%), and stomatitis (50.0%).

Patients underwent myeloablation with busulfan (with doses adjusted on the basis of pharmacokinetic analysis) and received beti-cel intravenously. The primary end point was transfusion independence (i.e., a weighted average hemoglobin level of ≥9 g per deciliter without red-cell transfusions for ≥12 months).\nRESULTS\nA total of 23 patients were enrolled and received treatment, with a median follow-up of 29.5 months (range, 13.0 to 48.2). Transfusion independence occurred in 20 of 22 patients who could be evaluated (91%), including 6 of 7 patients (86%) who were younger than 12 years of age. The average hemoglobin level during transfusion independence was 11.7 g per deciliter (range, 9.5 to 12.8). Twelve months after beti-cel infusion, the median level of gene therapy-derived adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution (HbA T87Q ) was 8.7 g per deciliter (range, 5.2 to 10.6) in patients who had transfusion independence. The safety profile of beti-cel was consistent with that of busulfan-based myeloablation. Four patients had at least one adverse event that was considered by the investigators to be related or possibly related to beti-cel; all events were nonserious except for thrombocytopenia (in 1 patient). No cases of cancer were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with beti-cel resulted in a sustained HbA T87Q level and a total hemoglobin level that was high enough to enable transfusion independence in most patients with a non-β 0 /β 0 genotype, including those younger than 12 years of age.

After undergoing HSPC mobilisation and busulfan-based, pharmacokinetic-adjusted myeloablative conditioning, patients were infused with beti-cel and followed up for 24 months. The primary efficacy outcome was transfusion independence, defined as weighted average haemoglobin level of 9 g/dL or above without pRBC transfusions for 12 or more months. The primary outcome was measured in all patients who received an infusion of beti-cel (transplant population); safety was evaluated in all patients who initiated study treatment (intention-to-treat population). Patients were eligible to enrol in the ongoing 13-year long-term follow-up study (for a total of 15 years), LTF-303 (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02633943). This trial, HGB-212, was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03207009), and is complete.\nFINDINGS\nFrom June 8, 2017, to March 12, 2020, 20 patients were screened for eligibility. One patient was ineligible and one withdrew consent before HSPC mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning. Of the 18 patients who received beti-cel, ten (56%) were male and eight (44%) were female; 13 (72%) were younger than 18 years at the time of informed consent, and five (28%) were older than 18 years. 12 (67%) patients had β 0 /β 0 genotypes, three (17%) had β 0 / β +IVS-I-110 , and three (17%) had β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 . As of Jan 30, 2023, all patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study and the median follow-up was 47·9 months (range 23·8-59·0). All 18 patients were evaluable for transfusion independence, with 16 (89%) of 18 reaching and maintaining transfusion independence to last follow=up (estimated effect size 89·9% [95% CI 65·3-98·6]). All patients had at least one adverse event after beti-cel infusion. There were no serious adverse events considered to be related to beti-cel, and no deaths.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese data demonstrate that beti-cel can allow patients with genotypes that cause severe β-thalassaemia (β 0 /β 0 , β 0 /β +IVS-I-110 , or β +IVS-I-110 /β +IVS-I-110 ) to reach transfusion independence. Beti-cel offers the potential to attain near-normal haemoglobin levels for those with severe forms of TDT, and a potentially curative option without the risks and limitations of allogeneic HSPC transplantation. Patients are being followed up for a total of 15 years to assess the durability of transfusion independence and long-term safety profile of beti-cel.\nFUNDING\nBluebird Bio, Somerville, MA, USA."", ""year"": ""2024"", ""venue"": ""Lancet (London, England)""}, {""paperId"": ""36997768"", ""title"": ""Therapeutic perspective for children and young adults living with thalassemia and sickle cell disease."", ""abstract"": ""Hemoglobinopathies, including thalassemias and sickle cell disease, are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, with estimated annual births of more than 330,000 affected infants. Hemoglobin disorders account for about 3.4% of deaths in children under 5 years of age. The distribution of these diseases is historically linked to current or previously malaria-endemic regions; however, immigration has led to a worldwide distribution of these diseases, making them a global health problem. During the last decade, new treatment approaches and novel therapies have been proposed, some of which have the potential to change the natural history of these disorders. Indeed, the first erythroid maturation agent, luspatercept, and gene therapy have been approved for beta-thalassemia adult patients. For sickle cell disease, molecules targeting vaso-occlusion and hemoglobin S polymerization include crizanlizumab, which has been approved for patients ≥ 16 years, voxelotor approved for patients ≥ 12 years, and L-glutamine for patients older than 5 years.    Conclusion: We herein present the most recent advances and future perspectives in thalassemia and sickle cell disease treatment, including new drugs, gene therapy, and gene editing, and the current clinical trial status in the pediatric populations. What is Known: • Red blood cell transfusions, iron chelation therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been the mainstay of treatment of thalassemia patients for decades. • For sickle cell disease, until 2005, treatment strategies were mostly the same as those for thalassemia, with the option of simple transfusion or exchange transfusion. In 2007, hydroxyurea was approved for patients ≥ 2 years old. What is New: • In 2019, gene therapy with betibeglogene autotemcel (LentiGlobin BB305) was approved for TDT patients ≥ 12 years old non β0/β0 without matched sibling donor. • Starting from 2017 several new drugs, such as L-glutamine (approved only by FDA), crizanlizumab (approved by FDA and EMA for patients ≥ 16 years), and lastly voxelotor (approved by FDA and EMA for patients ≥ 12 years old)."", ""year"": ""2023"", ""venue"": ""European journal of pediatrics""}, {""paperId"": ""38074412"", ""title"": ""Drug product attributes predict clinical efficacy in betibeglogene autotemcel gene therapy for β-thalassemia."", ""abstract"": ""Ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell lentiviral-based gene therapy with betibeglogene autotemcel has been studied in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia in Phase III clinical trials (HGB-207 and HGB-212), with 90% of patients reaching transfusion independence (TI).

CD34+ HSPCs were edited by means of CRISPR-Cas9 with a guide mRNA. Before the exa-cel infusion, patients underwent myeloablative conditioning with pharmacokinetically dose-adjusted busulfan. The primary end point was transfusion independence, defined as a weighted average hemoglobin level of 9 g per deciliter or higher without red-cell transfusion for at least 12 consecutive months. Total and fetal hemoglobin concentrations and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS\nA total of 52 patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia received exa-cel and were included in this prespecified interim analysis; the median follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 2.1 to 48.1). Neutrophils and platelets engrafted in each patient. Among the 35 patients with sufficient follow-up data for evaluation, transfusion independence occurred in 32 (91%; 95% confidence interval, 77 to 98; P<0.001 against the null hypothesis of a 50% response). During transfusion independence, the mean total hemoglobin level was 13.1 g per deciliter and the mean fetal hemoglobin level was 11.9 g per deciliter, and fetal hemoglobin had a pancellular distribution (≥94% of red cells). The safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with that of myeloablative busulfan conditioning and autologous HSPC transplantation. No deaths or cancers occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment with exa-cel, preceded by myeloablation, resulted in transfusion independence in 91% of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.

Luspatercept, a transforming growth factor-β inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing ineffective erythropoiesis, improving anemia, and possibly reducing iron loading. However, many patients do not respond to luspatercept, so additional therapeutics are needed. Several medications in development aim to induce hemoglobin F (HbF): sirolimus, benserazide, and IMR-687 (a phosphodiesterase 9 inhibitor). Another group of agents seeks to ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis and improve anemia by targeting abnormal iron metabolism in thalassemia: apotransferrin, VIT-2763 (a ferroportin inhibitor), PTG-300 (a hepcidin mimetic), and an erythroferrone antibody in early development. Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator, represents a unique mechanism to mitigate ineffective erythropoiesis. Genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers the potential for lifelong transfusion independence. Through a gene addition approach, lentiviral vectors have been used to introduce a β-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. One such product, betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel), has reached phase 3 trials with promising results. In addition, 2 gene editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9 and zinc-finger nucleases) are under investigation as a means to silence BCL11A to induce HbF with agents designated CTX001 and ST-400, respectively.
