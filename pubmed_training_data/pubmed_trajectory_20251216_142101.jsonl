Apixaban use was associated with lower risk for GIB than use of dabigatran (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.94]), edoxaban (HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.91]), or rivaroxaban (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.66 to 0.79]). No substantial differences were observed for other outcomes or DOAC-DOAC comparisons. The results were consistent for patients aged 80 years or older. Consistent associations between lower GIB risk and apixaban versus rivaroxaban were observed among patients receiving the standard dose (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.64 to 0.82]), those receiving a reduced dose (HR, 0.68 [CI, 0.61 to 0.77]), and those with chronic kidney disease (HR, 0.68 [CI, 0.59 to 0.77]).\nLIMITATION\nResidual confounding is possible.\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients with AF, apixaban use was associated with lower risk for GIB and similar rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, ICH, and all-cause mortality compared with dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. This finding was consistent for patients aged 80 years or older and those with chronic kidney disease, who are often underrepresented in clinical trials.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nNone.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36244055\">Title: Risk and Management of Bleeding Complications with Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Venous Thromboembolism: a Narrative Review.\nAuthors: Ballestri, Stefano, Romagnoli, Elisa, Arioli, Dimitriy et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Advances in therapy\nAbstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are highly prevalent conditions with a significant healthcare burden, and represent the main indications for anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first choice treatment of AF/VTE, and have become the most prescribed class of anticoagulants globally, overtaking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Compared to VKAs, DOACs have a similar or better efficacy/safety profile, with reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), while the risk of major bleeding and other bleeding harms may vary depending on the type of DOAC. We have critically reviewed available evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies regarding the risk of bleeding complications of DOACs compared to VKAs in patients with AF and VTE. Special patient populations (e.g., elderly, extreme body weights, chronic kidney disease) have specifically been addressed. Management of bleeding complications and possible resumption of anticoagulation, in particular after ICH and gastrointestinal bleeding, are also discussed. Finally, some suggestions are provided to choose the optimal DOAC to minimize adverse events according to individual patient characteristics and bleeding risk.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29183961\">Title: Oral anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost effectiveness analysis.\nAuthors: López-López, José A, Sterne, Jonathan A C, Thom, Howard H Z et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: BMJ (Clinical research ed.)\nAbstract: Objective To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for patients with atrial fibrillation. Design Systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost effectiveness analysis. Data sources Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Published randomised trials evaluating the use of a DOAC, vitamin K antagonist, or antiplatelet drug for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Results 23 randomised trials involving 94 656 patients were analysed: 13 compared a DOAC with warfarin dosed to achieve a target INR of 2.0-3.0. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin. The risk of stroke or systemic embolism was higher with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 to 1.75) and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 to 1.78) than with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The risk of all-cause mortality was lower with all DOACs than with warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.71, 0.61 to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (0.80, 0.69 to 0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 0.54), and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 0.90) reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin. The risk of major bleeding was higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 1.62), rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.45, 1.19 to 1.78), and rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). The risk of intracranial bleeding was substantially lower for most DOACs compared with warfarin, whereas the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with some DOACs than warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was ranked the highest for most outcomes, and was cost effective compared with warfarin. Conclusions The network meta-analysis informs the choice of DOACs for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Several DOACs are of net benefit compared with warfarin. A trial directly comparing DOACs would overcome the need for indirect comparisons to be made through network meta-analysis.

Rivaroxaban was also recently approved for the treatment of patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Their use demonstrated to have a favorable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality compared to warfarin, but with increased gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, their safety profile is compromised in multimorbidity patients requiring contemporary administration of several drugs. Comorbidity and polypharmacy have a high prevalence in elderly patients, who are also more susceptible to bleeding events. The combination of multiple treatments can cause relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by affecting the exposure or the pharmacological activities of DOACs. Although important differences of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties can be observed between DOACs, all of them are substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and thus may interact with strong inducers or inhibitors of this drug transporter. On the contrary, rivaroxaban and, to a lower extent, apixaban, are also susceptible to drugs altering the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) activities. In the present review, we summarize the potential DDI of DOACs with several classes of drugs that have been reported or have characteristics that may predict clinically significant DDIs when administered together with DOACs. Possible strategies, including dosage reduction, avoiding concomitant administration, or different time of treatment, will be also discussed to reduce the incidence of DDI with DOACs. Considering the available data from specific clinical trials or registries analysis, the use of DOACs is associated with fewer clinically relevant DDIs than warfarin, and their use represents an acceptable clinical choice. Nevertheless, DDIs can be significant in certain patient conditions so a careful evaluation should be made before prescribing a specific DOAC.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37939578\">Title: Gastrointestinal bleeding with direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and anaemia.\nAuthors: Al-Hussainy, Nour, Kragholm, Kristian Hay, Lundbye-Christensen, Søren et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Thrombosis research\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nA high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported with the use of some direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). This risk may be of particular concern in individuals with associated anaemia. The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in the risks of gastrointestinal bleeding and stroke among the four available DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and moderate or severe anaemia.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAll Danish patients diagnosed with incident AF who had a baseline haemoglobin measurement and subsequently initiated DOAC therapy between 2012 and 2021 were identified through administrative registries. Only patients with moderate or severe anaemia (N = 7269) were included and evaluated regarding the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding and stroke. Standardized absolute 1-year risks of stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding were calculated from multivariable Cox regression analyses. DOACs were compared pairwise RESULTS: Compared with apixaban, both dabigatran and rivaroxaban were associated with a significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with standardized 1-year risk ratios of 1.73 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.35) and 1.56 (95 % CI, 1.18-1.93), respectively, while no significant difference was seen in the comparison of apixaban with edoxaban 1.32 (95 % CI, 0.41-2.32). No significant differences in gastrointestinal bleeding were observed with pairwise comparisons of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Finally, no significant difference in stroke risk among the four DOACs was observed.\nCONCLUSION\nIn AF patients with moderate or severe anaemia, apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding than dabigatran and rivaroxaban. No significant difference in stroke risk was observed across all four available DOACs.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\nI'll search for more specific information about gastrointestinal bleeding risks in Phase III trials comparing DOACs.

We aimed to assess the relative benefit of new oral anticoagulants in key subgroups, and the effects on important secondary outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe searched Medline from Jan 1, 2009, to Nov 19, 2013, limiting searches to phase 3, randomised trials of patients with atrial fibrillation who were randomised to receive new oral anticoagulants or warfarin, and trials in which both efficacy and safety outcomes were reported. We did a prespecified meta-analysis of all 71,683 participants included in the RE-LY, ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials. The main outcomes were stroke and systemic embolic events, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for each outcome. We did subgroup analyses to assess whether differences in patient and trial characteristics affected outcomes. We used a random-effects model to compare pooled outcomes and tested for heterogeneity.\nFINDINGS\n42,411 participants received a new oral anticoagulant and 29,272 participants received warfarin. New oral anticoagulants significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared with warfarin (RR 0·81, 95% CI 0·73-0·91; p<0·0001), mainly driven by a reduction in haemorrhagic stroke (0·49, 0·38-0·64; p<0·0001). New oral anticoagulants also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0·90, 0·85-0·95; p=0·0003) and intracranial haemorrhage (0·48, 0·39-0·59; p<0·0001), but increased gastrointestinal bleeding (1·25, 1·01-1·55; p=0·04). We noted no heterogeneity for stroke or systemic embolic events in important subgroups, but there was a greater relative reduction in major bleeding with new oral anticoagulants when the centre-based time in therapeutic range was less than 66% than when it was 66% or more (0·69, 0·59-0·81 vs 0·93, 0·76-1·13; p for interaction 0·022). Low-dose new oral anticoagulant regimens showed similar overall reductions in stroke or systemic embolic events to warfarin (1·03, 0·84-1·27; p=0·74), and a more favourable bleeding profile (0·65, 0·43-1·00; p=0·05), but significantly more ischaemic strokes (1·28, 1·02-1·60; p=0·045).\nINTERPRETATION\nThis meta-analysis is the first to include data for all four new oral anticoagulants studied in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for stroke prevention or systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. New oral anticoagulants had a favourable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, and with similar major bleeding as for warfarin, but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The relative efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants was consistent across a wide range of patients. Our findings offer clinicians a more comprehensive picture of the new oral anticoagulants as a therapeutic option to reduce the risk of stroke in this patient population.\nFUNDING\nNone.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25891842\">Title: Safety of the direct-acting anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Rong, Fen, Jia, Bin, Huang, Pinxian et al. | Year: 2015 | Journal: Thrombosis research\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is known as one of the independent risk factors for stroke and might significantly increase its risk. Nowadays, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed and demonstrated a more promising option to warfarin, the conclusion for safety is heterogeneous in different studies. It indicates the importance of comprehensive comparison of safety between DOACs and warfarin.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nFour studies including ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, RE-LY and ROCKET-AF were included in the meta-analysis to perform separate meta-analyses for high-dose regimen, low-dose regimen and their combination. The events included major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, non-major clinically relevant and minor bleeding.\nRESULTS\nRegardless of high dose or low dose regimen, DOACs were associated with lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage but due to no significant association for gastrointestinal bleeding, the overall effect measured by the major bleeding was also insignificant (High dose: RR=0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; Low dose: RR=0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04). However, the combined result of high-dose and low-dose regimens showed DOACs were associated with lower risk of major bleeding events (RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95).\nCONCLUSIONS\nMeta-analyses have showed the comparative safety of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants than warfarin in most endpoints and even better in intracranial haemorrhage. Therefore, without the need of INR monitoring, DOACs demonstrated promising alternatives to warfarin in prevention of stroke in patients with AF.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24869601\">Title: Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of the new anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.\nAuthors: Jia, Bin, Lynn, Henry S, Rong, Fen et al. | Year: 2014 | Journal: Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation by the meta-analyses performed for 5 studies ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and J-ROCKET.\nMETHODS\nThe events including primary efficacy endpoint (stroke and systemic embolism), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, and myocardial infarction were used for efficacy analysis and those including major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding were used for safety analysis. Instead of combining both doses to 1 meta-analysis, the high-dose groups of RE-LY (150 mg twice daily) and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (60 mg twice daily) were combined with the single dose studies ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, and J-ROCKET. A separate meta-analysis was done for the low-dose groups of RE-LY (110 mg twice daily) and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (30 mg twice daily).\nRESULTS\nThe high-dose regimen had better performance than low dose in efficacy. In addition, low-dose regimen demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, and intracranial hemorrhage.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe new oral anticoagulants demonstrated promising alternatives to warfarin in prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\nI'll search for more specific information about patient characteristics and gastrointestinal bleeding correlations.

We describe and compare real-world safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in subgroups of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at high risk for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, utilizing data from a national quasi-exhaustive French database.\nMETHODS\nAnticoagulant-naïve adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with ≥1 gastrointestinal bleeding risk factor, initiating anticoagulant treatment January 2016-December 2019, and covered by the French national health data system were eligible. The following subgroups were evaluated: patients age ≥75 years, receiving concomitant medications, HAS-BLED score ≥3, and chronic kidney disease stage 3-4. Outcomes included major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism. Patient characteristics were balanced using propensity score matching.\nRESULTS\nA total of 314,184 patients were identified; characteristics were similar for propensity score-matched subgroups in VKA/DOAC and DOAC/DOAC comparisons. DOACs showed lower risk of major bleeding versus VKAs in all subgroups evaluated (p<0.0001 for all). Apixaban showed lower risk of major bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding versus rivaroxaban in all subgroups (p≤0.05 for all) and versus dabigatran in elderly patients, patients with HAS-BLED score ≥3, and those receiving concomitant medications (p<0.05 for all).

Gastrointestinal bleeding is frequent, but its drug-specific characteristics remain unclear. This study examined the frequency and characteristics of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation for different DOACs. Methods : The present study included 978 patients receiving treatment with DOACs for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation between 2011 and 2018 and examined the frequencies of clinically significant events including major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, hemorrhagic events, or death during the first 5 years of prescription. Gastrointestinal bleeding was evaluated for the frequency, source and severity of gastrointestinal bleeding by DOAC type. Results : The median age of subjects was 73 years (interquartile range, 65-80 years), and 622 (64%) were male. The overall observation period was 2499 person-years. During this period, 102 (4.1/100 person-years) major cardiovascular events and 107 (4.3/100 person-years) clinically significant bleeding were reported, including 60 cases (2.4/100 person-years) of gastrointestinal bleeding and 37 cases (1.5/100 person-years) of all-cause mortality. Gastrointestinal bleeding accounted for more than half of all bleeding events among DOAC users, and bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract was more common than that from the upper gastrointestinal tract, particularly with dabigatran. No significant difference was seen in the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding by drug type. Peptic ulcer accounted for half of the events of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, all of which were severe. Conclusions : Gastrointestinal bleeding is frequent among patients taking DOACs, especially from the lower alimentary tract. The tendency was more pronounced with dabigatran. In the upper gastrointestinal tract, severe peptic ulcer bleeding is common and requires caution.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40761167\">Title: Comparative analysis of all-cause health care resource utilization and costs among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in France: a nationwide cohort analysis.\nAuthors: Pesce, Giancarlo, Gusto, Gaelle, Quignot, Nadia et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Journal of medical economics\nAbstract: AIMS\nThis population-based cohort study compared healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and direct HCRU costs (medical and non-medical) in French patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and at high-risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after initiating an anticoagulant treatment with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) or with direct-oral anticoagulants (DOACs).\nMETHODS\nNVAF patients at high risk of GIB who initiated apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or VKAs between 2016 and 2019 were identified from the French National Healthcare Data System (SNDS) database. The first anticoagulant reimbursement set the index date and patients were followed-up until drug discontinuation/switch, death, or study end, whichever came first. Differences in patient characteristics were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matched (PSM) cohorts. Direct (medical and non-medical) HCRU and costs per patient per month (PPPM) were compared using two-part generalized linear models.\nRESULTS\nA total of 314,184 patients were identified (mean age 79.0 years; 51.0% female). In PSM cohorts, patients treated with DOACs had less outpatient visits, laboratory tests, and hospitalizations as compared to patients treated with VKAs. Each DOAC was associated with lower direct HCRU costs PPPM than VKAs (apixaban/VKAs: €1,868/€2,082; rivaroxaban/VKA: €1,788/€1,982; dabigatran/VKA: €1,461/€1,665; all p < .001). In DOAC-DOAC comparisons, apixaban was associated with lower direct HCRU costs than rivaroxaban and dabigatran (apixaban/rivaroxaban: €1,424/€1,460; apixaban/dabigatran: €1,444/€1,460), while rivaroxaban was associated with lower direct HCRU costs than dabigatran (rivaroxaban/dabigatran: €1,447/€1,459; all p < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients at high-risk of GIB, DOACs were associated with reduced direct HCRU costs compared to VKAs. Among DOACs, apixaban was associated with reduced direct HCRU costs.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\nI'll browse the first paper (PMID 36315950) for more detailed comparative risk data.

Apixaban use was associated with lower risk for GIB than use of dabigatran (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.94]), edoxaban (HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.66 to 0.91]), or rivaroxaban (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.66 to 0.79]). No substantial differences were observed for other outcomes or DOAC-DOAC comparisons. The results were consistent for patients aged 80 years or older. Consistent associations between lower GIB risk and apixaban versus rivaroxaban were observed among patients receiving the standard dose (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.64 to 0.82]), those receiving a reduced dose (HR, 0.68 [CI, 0.61 to 0.77]), and those with chronic kidney disease (HR, 0.68 [CI, 0.59 to 0.77]).\nLIMITATION\nResidual confounding is possible.\nCONCLUSION\nAmong patients with AF, apixaban use was associated with lower risk for GIB and similar rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, ICH, and all-cause mortality compared with dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. This finding was consistent for patients aged 80 years or older and those with chronic kidney disease, who are often underrepresented in clinical trials.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nNone.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34143317\">Title: Review Article: Gastrointestinal Bleeding Risk with Direct Oral Anticoagulants.\nAuthors: Benamouzig, Robert, Guenoun, Maxime, Deutsch, David et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Cardiovascular drugs and therapy\nAbstract: PURPOSE\nAlthough direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are associated with an overall favourable safety profile, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with DOACs compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) remains controversial. Accordingly, we aimed to provide a focused overview of the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban and its management.\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed published studies reporting on DOACs with gastrointestinal bleeding as an outcome, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective database studies and large-scale prospective cohort studies.\nRESULTS\nCumulative evidence confirms no notable difference in major gastrointestinal bleeding risk between DOACs and VKAs. Moreover, gastrointestinal bleeding in DOAC-treated patients seems less severe and requires less intensive management. The main cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in DOAC-treated patients appears to be gastroduodenal ulcers, whereas lower gastrointestinal bleedings are mainly due to diverticula followed by angiodysplasia and haemorrhoids. The lack of head-to-head RCTs with DOACs precludes drawing conclusions on the DOAC with the lowest gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Prescribing physicians should be aware of risk factors for DOAC-related gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g. age > 65, heavy alcohol use, uncontrolled hypertension, hepatic or renal dysfunction, active cancer, anaemia) and adopt preventive measures accordingly. Management of DOAC-associated major gastrointestinal bleeding involves temporary discontinuation of the DOAC, investigation of the bleeding source and treatment of bleeding with fluid resuscitation combined with transfusion and endoscopic haemostasis.\nCONCLUSION\nDOACs as a class do not increase the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding compared to VKAs, which supports their continued use for different anticoagulant indications.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36244055\">Title: Risk and Management of Bleeding Complications with Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Venous Thromboembolism: a Narrative Review.\nAuthors: Ballestri, Stefano, Romagnoli, Elisa, Arioli, Dimitriy et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Advances in therapy\nAbstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are highly prevalent conditions with a significant healthcare burden, and represent the main indications for anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first choice treatment of AF/VTE, and have become the most prescribed class of anticoagulants globally, overtaking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Compared to VKAs, DOACs have a similar or better efficacy/safety profile, with reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), while the risk of major bleeding and other bleeding harms may vary depending on the type of DOAC. We have critically reviewed available evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies regarding the risk of bleeding complications of DOACs compared to VKAs in patients with AF and VTE. Special patient populations (e.g., elderly, extreme body weights, chronic kidney disease) have specifically been addressed. Management of bleeding complications and possible resumption of anticoagulation, in particular after ICH and gastrointestinal bleeding, are also discussed. Finally, some suggestions are provided to choose the optimal DOAC to minimize adverse events according to individual patient characteristics and bleeding risk.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31155730\">Title: Deep vein thrombosis: update on diagnosis and management.\nAuthors: Kruger, Paul C, Eikelboom, John W, Douketis, James D et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: The Medical journal of Australia\nAbstract: Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires a multifaceted approach that includes clinical assessment, evaluation of pre-test probability, and objective diagnostic testing. Common symptoms and signs of DVT are pain, swelling, erythema and dilated veins in the affected limb. The pre-test probability of DVT can be assessed using a clinical decision rule that stratifies DVT into \"unlikely\" or \"likely\". If DVT is \"unlikely\", refer for D-dimer test. If the D-dimer level is normal, DVT can be excluded; if the D-dimer level is increased, refer for compression ultrasound. If DVT is \"likely\", refer for compression ultrasound. When DVT is confirmed, anticoagulation is indicated to control symptoms, prevent progression and reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation may consist of a parenteral anticoagulant overlapped by warfarin or followed by a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (dabigatran or edoxaban), or of a DOAC (apixaban or rivaroxaban) without initial parenteral therapy. DOACs are the preferred treatment for DVT because they are at least as effective, safer and more convenient than warfarin. DOACs may require dose reduction or avoidance in patients with renal dysfunction, and should be avoided in pregnancy. Recent evidence shows that DVT in patients with cancer may be treated with edoxaban (after discontinuation of 5 days of initial heparin or low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) or rivaroxaban if patients prefer not to have daily injections of LMWH, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is higher with DOACs than with LMWH in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29183961\">Title: Oral anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation: systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost effectiveness analysis.\nAuthors: López-López, José A, Sterne, Jonathan A C, Thom, Howard H Z et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: BMJ (Clinical research ed.)\nAbstract: Objective To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for patients with atrial fibrillation. Design Systematic review, network meta-analysis, and cost effectiveness analysis. Data sources Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Published randomised trials evaluating the use of a DOAC, vitamin K antagonist, or antiplatelet drug for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Results 23 randomised trials involving 94 656 patients were analysed: 13 compared a DOAC with warfarin dosed to achieve a target INR of 2.0-3.0. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.94), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (0.65, 0.52 to 0.81), edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01), and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (0.88, 0.74 to 1.03) reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin. The risk of stroke or systemic embolism was higher with edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.33, 1.02 to 1.75) and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (1.35, 1.03 to 1.78) than with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The risk of all-cause mortality was lower with all DOACs than with warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (0.71, 0.61 to 0.81), dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (0.80, 0.69 to 0.93), edoxaban 30 mg once daily (0.46, 0.40 to 0.54), and edoxaban 60 mg once daily (0.78, 0.69 to 0.90) reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin. The risk of major bleeding was higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.33, 1.09 to 1.62), rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than apixaban 5 mg twice daily (1.45, 1.19 to 1.78), and rivaroxaban 20 mg twice daily than edoxaban 60 mg once daily (1.31, 1.07 to 1.59). The risk of intracranial bleeding was substantially lower for most DOACs compared with warfarin, whereas the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with some DOACs than warfarin. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily was ranked the highest for most outcomes, and was cost effective compared with warfarin. Conclusions The network meta-analysis informs the choice of DOACs for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Several DOACs are of net benefit compared with warfarin. A trial directly comparing DOACs would overcome the need for indirect comparisons to be made through network meta-analysis.

Rivaroxaban was also recently approved for the treatment of patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Their use demonstrated to have a favorable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality compared to warfarin, but with increased gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, their safety profile is compromised in multimorbidity patients requiring contemporary administration of several drugs. Comorbidity and polypharmacy have a high prevalence in elderly patients, who are also more susceptible to bleeding events. The combination of multiple treatments can cause relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by affecting the exposure or the pharmacological activities of DOACs. Although important differences of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties can be observed between DOACs, all of them are substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and thus may interact with strong inducers or inhibitors of this drug transporter. On the contrary, rivaroxaban and, to a lower extent, apixaban, are also susceptible to drugs altering the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) activities.

Possible strategies, including dosage reduction, avoiding concomitant administration, or different time of treatment, will be also discussed to reduce the incidence of DDI with DOACs. Considering the available data from specific clinical trials or registries analysis, the use of DOACs is associated with fewer clinically relevant DDIs than warfarin, and their use represents an acceptable clinical choice.

We did a prespecified meta-analysis of all 71,683 participants included in the RE-LY, ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials. The main outcomes were stroke and systemic embolic events, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for each outcome. We did subgroup analyses to assess whether differences in patient and trial characteristics affected outcomes. We used a random-effects model to compare pooled outcomes and tested for heterogeneity.\nFINDINGS\n42,411 participants received a new oral anticoagulant and 29,272 participants received warfarin. New oral anticoagulants significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared with warfarin (RR 0·81, 95% CI 0·73-0·91; p<0·0001), mainly driven by a reduction in haemorrhagic stroke (0·49, 0·38-0·64; p<0·0001). New oral anticoagulants also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0·90, 0·85-0·95; p=0·0003) and intracranial haemorrhage (0·48, 0·39-0·59; p<0·0001), but increased gastrointestinal bleeding (1·25, 1·01-1·55; p=0·04). We noted no heterogeneity for stroke or systemic embolic events in important subgroups, but there was a greater relative reduction in major bleeding with new oral anticoagulants when the centre-based time in therapeutic range was less than 66% than when it was 66% or more (0·69, 0·59-0·81 vs 0·93, 0·76-1·13; p for interaction 0·022). Low-dose new oral anticoagulant regimens showed similar overall reductions in stroke or systemic embolic events to warfarin (1·03, 0·84-1·27; p=0·74), and a more favourable bleeding profile (0·65, 0·43-1·00; p=0·05), but significantly more ischaemic strokes (1·28, 1·02-1·60; p=0·045).\nINTERPRETATION\nThis meta-analysis is the first to include data for all four new oral anticoagulants studied in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for stroke prevention or systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. New oral anticoagulants had a favourable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, and with similar major bleeding as for warfarin, but increased gastrointestinal bleeding.

It indicates the importance of comprehensive comparison of safety between DOACs and warfarin.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nFour studies including ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, RE-LY and ROCKET-AF were included in the meta-analysis to perform separate meta-analyses for high-dose regimen, low-dose regimen and their combination. The events included major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, non-major clinically relevant and minor bleeding.\nRESULTS\nRegardless of high dose or low dose regimen, DOACs were associated with lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage but due to no significant association for gastrointestinal bleeding, the overall effect measured by the major bleeding was also insignificant (High dose: RR=0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; Low dose: RR=0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04).

Rivaroxaban was also recently approved for the treatment of patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Their use demonstrated to have a favorable risk-benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality compared to warfarin, but with increased gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, their safety profile is compromised in multimorbidity patients requiring contemporary administration of several drugs. Comorbidity and polypharmacy have a high prevalence in elderly patients, who are also more susceptible to bleeding events. The combination of multiple treatments can cause relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by affecting the exposure or the pharmacological activities of DOACs. Although important differences of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties can be observed between DOACs, all of them are substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and thus may interact with strong inducers or inhibitors of this drug transporter. On the contrary, rivaroxaban and, to a lower extent, apixaban, are also susceptible to drugs altering the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) activities. In the present review, we summarize the potential DDI of DOACs with several classes of drugs that have been reported or have characteristics that may predict clinically significant DDIs when administered together with DOACs. Possible strategies, including dosage reduction, avoiding concomitant administration, or different time of treatment, will be also discussed to reduce the incidence of DDI with DOACs. Considering the available data from specific clinical trials or registries analysis, the use of DOACs is associated with fewer clinically relevant DDIs than warfarin, and their use represents an acceptable clinical choice.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is frequent, but its drug-specific characteristics remain unclear. This study examined the frequency and characteristics of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation for different DOACs. Methods : The present study included 978 patients receiving treatment with DOACs for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation between 2011 and 2018 and examined the frequencies of clinically significant events including major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, hemorrhagic events, or death during the first 5 years of prescription. Gastrointestinal bleeding was evaluated for the frequency, source and severity of gastrointestinal bleeding by DOAC type. Results : The median age of subjects was 73 years (interquartile range, 65-80 years), and 622 (64%) were male. The overall observation period was 2499 person-years. During this period, 102 (4.1/100 person-years) major cardiovascular events and 107 (4.3/100 person-years) clinically significant bleeding were reported, including 60 cases (2.4/100 person-years) of gastrointestinal bleeding and 37 cases (1.5/100 person-years) of all-cause mortality. Gastrointestinal bleeding accounted for more than half of all bleeding events among DOAC users, and bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract was more common than that from the upper gastrointestinal tract, particularly with dabigatran. No significant difference was seen in the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding by drug type. Peptic ulcer accounted for half of the events of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, all of which were severe.

Moreover, gastrointestinal bleeding in DOAC-treated patients seems less severe and requires less intensive management. The main cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in DOAC-treated patients appears to be gastroduodenal ulcers, whereas lower gastrointestinal bleedings are mainly due to diverticula followed by angiodysplasia and haemorrhoids. The lack of head-to-head RCTs with DOACs precludes drawing conclusions on the DOAC with the lowest gastrointestinal bleeding risk.

increases bleeding risk, particularly with drugs affecting P-glycoprotein (all DOACs) or CYP enzymes (rivaroxaban and apixaban) <cite id=\"35745692\">Ferri et al., 2022</cite>.\n\n**Key Risk Factors for DOAC-related Gastrointestinal Bleeding:**\n- Age >65 years\n- Heavy alcohol use\n- Uncontrolled hypertension\n- Hepatic or renal dysfunction\n- Active cancer\n- Anemia\n- Concomitant antiplatelet or NSAID use <cite id=\"34143317\">Benamouzig et al., 2022</cite>\n\nIn summary, apixaban consistently demonstrates the lowest gastrointestinal bleeding risk among DOACs, with this advantage being particularly pronounced in elderly patients, those with chronic kidney disease, anemia, and high bleeding risk scores.", "total_tool_calls": 5, "tools_used": ["browse_webpage", "pubmed_search"],
