Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.

In phase 3 development, lecanemab has been shown to reduce markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and reduce decline on clinical endpoints of cognition and function at 18 months.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) results from Clarity AD which were exploratory outcomes in this trial.\nDESIGN\nClarity AD was an 18-month, multi-center, double-blind, phase 3 trial.\nSETTING\nEarly Alzheimer's disease.\nPARTICIPANTS\nIndividuals 50-90 years of age with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid evidence of cerebral amyloid accumulation.\nINTERVENTION\nPlacebo or lecanemab 10-mg/kg IV biweekly.\nMEASUREMENTS\nHRQoL was measured at baseline and every 6 months using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L; by subject) and Quality of Life in AD (QOL-AD; by subject and proxy). Study partner burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled (lecanemab:898; placebo:897). At month 18, adjusted mean change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L and QOL-AD by subject showed 49% and 56% less decline, respectively. QOL-AD rated by study partner as proxy resulted in 23% less decline. ZBI adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months resulted in 38% less increase of care partner burden. Individual HRQoL test items and dimensions also showed lecanemab benefit.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was associated with a relative preservation of HRQoL and less increase in caregiver burden, with consistent benefits seen across different quality of life scales and within scale subdomains. These benefits provide valuable patient reported outcomes which, together with previously reported benefits of lecanemab across multiple measures of cognition, function, disease progression, and biomarkers, demonstrate that lecanemab treatment may offer meaningful benefits to patients, care partners, and society.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40189473\"">Title: Clarity AD: Asian regional analysis of a phase III trial of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Chen, Christopher, Katayama, Sadao, Lee, Jae-Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAcross Asia, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to rise dramatically due to, among other factors, rapidly aging populations. Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38730496\"">Title: Updated safety results from phase 3 lecanemab study in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Honig, Lawrence S, Sabbagh, Marwan N, van Dyck, Christopher H et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is a major health problem of aging, with tremendous burden on healthcare systems, patients, and families globally. Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3-6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov numbers: Clarity AD NCT03887455).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""33865446\"">Title: A randomized, double-blind, phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial in early Alzheimer's disease with lecanemab, an anti-Aβ protofibril antibody.\nAuthors: Swanson, Chad J, Zhang, Yong, Dhadda, Shobha et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nLecanemab (BAN2401), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, preferentially targets soluble aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ), with activity across oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils. BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia.\nMETHODS\nBAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging.\nRESULTS\nA total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints.

Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes.\nRESULTS\nAmong 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.02 (95% CI, -7.01 to -5.03) in the donanemab group and -9.27 (95% CI, -10.23 to -8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and -10.2 (95% CI, -11.22 to -9.16) with donanemab and -13.1 (95% CI, -14.10 to -12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P < .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45]; P < .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40063015\"">Title: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities With Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.\nAuthors: Zimmer, Jennifer A, Ardayfio, Paul, Wang, Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThese prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""36094645\"">Title: Association of Amyloid Reduction After Donanemab Treatment With Tau Pathology and Clinical Outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Shcherbinin, Sergey, Evans, Cynthia D, Lu, Ming et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nβ-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits biologically define Alzheimer disease.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo perform post hoc analyses of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment and assess its association with tau pathology and clinical measures.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ) was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, with a double-blind period of up to 76 weeks and a 48-week follow-up period. The study was conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada. Enrolled were participants from 60 to 85 years of age with gradual and progressive change in memory function for 6 months or more, early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nDonanemab (an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate β-amyloid epitope) dosing was every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations occurred at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in amyloid, tau, and clinical decline after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nThe primary study randomized 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 female participants [53.3%]). The trial excluded 1683 of 1955 individuals screened. The rate of donanemab-induced amyloid reduction at 24 weeks was moderately correlated with the amount of baseline amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.39; P &lt; .001). Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResults of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence. Data from other trials will be important to confirm aforementioned observations, particularly treatment response by APOE ε4 status.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""33720637\"">Title: Donanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease.\nAuthors: Mintun, Mark A, Lo, Albert C, Duggan Evans, Cynthia et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nA hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Donanemab, an antibody that targets a modified form of deposited Aβ, is being investigated for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 2 trial of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease who had tau and amyloid deposition on positron-emission tomography (PET). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS; range, 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment) at 76 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 13 ), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the change in the amyloid and tau burden on PET.\nRESULTS\nA total of 257 patients were enrolled; 131 were assigned to receive donanemab and 126 to receive placebo. The baseline iADRS score was 106 in both groups. The change from baseline in the iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.86 with donanemab and -10.06 with placebo (difference, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 6.27; P = 0.04). The results for most secondary outcomes showed no substantial difference. At 76 weeks, the reductions in the amyloid plaque level and the global tau load were 85.06 centiloids and 0.01 greater, respectively, with donanemab than with placebo. Amyloid-related cerebral edema or effusions (mostly asymptomatic) occurred with donanemab.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with early Alzheimer's disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. Longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer's disease.

Least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in iADRS score at week 76 was smaller with donanemab than with placebo in the combined (low-medium tau and high tau) and low-medium tau (N = 76) subpopulations (LSM change difference: 4.43 and 3.99, representing 38.8% and 40.2% slowing of disease progression, respectively). Slowing of AD progression with donanemab was also observed for other clinical outcomes. Marked decreases in amyloid plaque and plasma phosphorylated tau 217 were observed; amyloid clearance (< 24.1 Centiloids) was observed in 83.3% of the combined donanemab and 0% of the combined placebo groups. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema/effusions occurred in ten (22.2%) donanemab-treated participants (one [2.2%] symptomatic) and one (2.3%) placebo-treated participant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe overall efficacy and safety of donanemab in Japanese participants were similar to the global TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""google_search\"">36449413 ARIA-E placebo percentage</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\n<snippet id=\""G1\"">Title: Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease\nby CH van Dyck · 2023 · Cited by 5105 — PMID: 36449413 ...

Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3-6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov numbers: Clarity AD NCT03887455).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40189473\"">Title: Clarity AD: Asian regional analysis of a phase III trial of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Chen, Christopher, Katayama, Sadao, Lee, Jae-Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAcross Asia, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to rise dramatically due to, among other factors, rapidly aging populations. Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">lecanemab placebo ARIA-E 1.7</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 0 results.

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.

In phase 3 development, lecanemab has been shown to reduce markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and reduce decline on clinical endpoints of cognition and function at 18 months.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) results from Clarity AD which were exploratory outcomes in this trial.\nDESIGN\nClarity AD was an 18-month, multi-center, double-blind, phase 3 trial.\nSETTING\nEarly Alzheimer's disease.\nPARTICIPANTS\nIndividuals 50-90 years of age with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid evidence of cerebral amyloid accumulation.\nINTERVENTION\nPlacebo or lecanemab 10-mg/kg IV biweekly.\nMEASUREMENTS\nHRQoL was measured at baseline and every 6 months using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L; by subject) and Quality of Life in AD (QOL-AD; by subject and proxy). Study partner burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled (lecanemab:898; placebo:897). At month 18, adjusted mean change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L and QOL-AD by subject showed 49% and 56% less decline, respectively. QOL-AD rated by study partner as proxy resulted in 23% less decline. ZBI adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months resulted in 38% less increase of care partner burden. Individual HRQoL test items and dimensions also showed lecanemab benefit.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was associated with a relative preservation of HRQoL and less increase in caregiver burden, with consistent benefits seen across different quality of life scales and within scale subdomains. These benefits provide valuable patient reported outcomes which, together with previously reported benefits of lecanemab across multiple measures of cognition, function, disease progression, and biomarkers, demonstrate that lecanemab treatment may offer meaningful benefits to patients, care partners, and society.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40189473\"">Title: Clarity AD: Asian regional analysis of a phase III trial of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Chen, Christopher, Katayama, Sadao, Lee, Jae-Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAcross Asia, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to rise dramatically due to, among other factors, rapidly aging populations.

For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38730496\"">Title: Updated safety results from phase 3 lecanemab study in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Honig, Lawrence S, Sabbagh, Marwan N, van Dyck, Christopher H et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is a major health problem of aging, with tremendous burden on healthcare systems, patients, and families globally. Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3-6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov numbers: Clarity AD NCT03887455).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""33865446\"">Title: A randomized, double-blind, phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial in early Alzheimer's disease with lecanemab, an anti-Aβ protofibril antibody.\nAuthors: Swanson, Chad J, Zhang, Yong, Dhadda, Shobha et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nLecanemab (BAN2401), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, preferentially targets soluble aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ), with activity across oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils. BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia.\nMETHODS\nBAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging.\nRESULTS\nA total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints.

Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes.\nRESULTS\nAmong 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.02 (95% CI, -7.01 to -5.03) in the donanemab group and -9.27 (95% CI, -10.23 to -8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and -10.2 (95% CI, -11.22 to -9.16) with donanemab and -13.1 (95% CI, -14.10 to -12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P < .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45]; P < .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40063015\"">Title: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities With Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.\nAuthors: Zimmer, Jennifer A, Ardayfio, Paul, Wang, Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThese prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""36094645\"">Title: Association of Amyloid Reduction After Donanemab Treatment With Tau Pathology and Clinical Outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Shcherbinin, Sergey, Evans, Cynthia D, Lu, Ming et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nβ-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits biologically define Alzheimer disease.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo perform post hoc analyses of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment and assess its association with tau pathology and clinical measures.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ) was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, with a double-blind period of up to 76 weeks and a 48-week follow-up period. The study was conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada. Enrolled were participants from 60 to 85 years of age with gradual and progressive change in memory function for 6 months or more, early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nDonanemab (an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate β-amyloid epitope) dosing was every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations occurred at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in amyloid, tau, and clinical decline after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nThe primary study randomized 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 female participants [53.3%]). The trial excluded 1683 of 1955 individuals screened. The rate of donanemab-induced amyloid reduction at 24 weeks was moderately correlated with the amount of baseline amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.39; P &lt; .001). Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResults of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence. Data from other trials will be important to confirm aforementioned observations, particularly treatment response by APOE ε4 status.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""33720637\"">Title: Donanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease.\nAuthors: Mintun, Mark A, Lo, Albert C, Duggan Evans, Cynthia et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nA hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Donanemab, an antibody that targets a modified form of deposited Aβ, is being investigated for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 2 trial of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease who had tau and amyloid deposition on positron-emission tomography (PET). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS; range, 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment) at 76 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 13 ), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the change in the amyloid and tau burden on PET.\nRESULTS\nA total of 257 patients were enrolled; 131 were assigned to receive donanemab and 126 to receive placebo. The baseline iADRS score was 106 in both groups. The change from baseline in the iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.86 with donanemab and -10.06 with placebo (difference, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 6.27; P = 0.04). The results for most secondary outcomes showed no substantial difference. At 76 weeks, the reductions in the amyloid plaque level and the global tau load were 85.06 centiloids and 0.01 greater, respectively, with donanemab than with placebo. Amyloid-related cerebral edema or effusions (mostly asymptomatic) occurred with donanemab.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with early Alzheimer's disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. Longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer's disease.

Here, we report clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and safety results for the Japanese subpopulation.\nMETHODS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (N = 1736) was conducted in eight countries, including Japan (enrollment June 2020-November 2021; database lock April 2023). Participants (60-85 years) with early, symptomatic AD (mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia), Mini-Mental State Examination score 20-28, and confirmed amyloid and tau pathology were randomized 1:1 (stratified by tau status) to intravenous donanemab (700 mg for three doses, then 1400 mg/dose) or placebo every 4 weeks for 72 weeks. Primary outcome was change from baseline to week 76 in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score. Other outcomes included clinical measures of cognitive and functional impairment, biomarkers, and safety.\nRESULTS\nOf 88 Japanese participants (43 placebo, 45 donanemab), 7 in each group discontinued. Least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in iADRS score at week 76 was smaller with donanemab than with placebo in the combined (low-medium tau and high tau) and low-medium tau (N = 76) subpopulations (LSM change difference: 4.43 and 3.99, representing 38.8% and 40.2% slowing of disease progression, respectively). Slowing of AD progression with donanemab was also observed for other clinical outcomes. Marked decreases in amyloid plaque and plasma phosphorylated tau 217 were observed; amyloid clearance (< 24.1 Centiloids) was observed in 83.3% of the combined donanemab and 0% of the combined placebo groups. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema/effusions occurred in ten (22.2%) donanemab-treated participants (one [2.2%] symptomatic) and one (2.3%) placebo-treated participant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe overall efficacy and safety of donanemab in Japanese participants were similar to the global TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""google_search\"">36449413 ARIA-E placebo percentage</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\n<snippet id=\""G1\"">Title: Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease\nby CH van Dyck · 2023 · Cited by 5105 — PMID: 36449413 ...

Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%).

Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">lecanemab placebo ARIA-E 1.7</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 0 results.

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events.

Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%).

Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring.

Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResults of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence. Data from other trials will be important to confirm aforementioned observations, particularly treatment response by APOE ε4 status.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403."", ""year"": ""2022"", ""venue"": ""JAMA neurology""}, {""paperId"": ""33720637"", ""title"": ""Donanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease."", ""abstract"": ""BACKGROUND\nA hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Donanemab, an antibody that targets a modified form of deposited Aβ, is being investigated for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 2 trial of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease who had tau and amyloid deposition on positron-emission tomography (PET). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS; range, 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment) at 76 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 13 ), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the change in the amyloid and tau burden on PET.\nRESULTS\nA total of 257 patients were enrolled; 131 were assigned to receive donanemab and 126 to receive placebo. The baseline iADRS score was 106 in both groups. The change from baseline in the iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.86 with donanemab and -10.06 with placebo (difference, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 6.27; P = 0.04). The results for most secondary outcomes showed no substantial difference. At 76 weeks, the reductions in the amyloid plaque level and the global tau load were 85.06 centiloids and 0.01 greater, respectively, with donanemab than with placebo. Amyloid-related cerebral edema or effusions (mostly asymptomatic) occurred with donanemab.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with early Alzheimer's disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. Longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer's disease.

Here, we report clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and safety results for the Japanese subpopulation.\nMETHODS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (N = 1736) was conducted in eight countries, including Japan (enrollment June 2020-November 2021; database lock April 2023). Participants (60-85 years) with early, symptomatic AD (mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia), Mini-Mental State Examination score 20-28, and confirmed amyloid and tau pathology were randomized 1:1 (stratified by tau status) to intravenous donanemab (700 mg for three doses, then 1400 mg/dose) or placebo every 4 weeks for 72 weeks. Primary outcome was change from baseline to week 76 in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score. Other outcomes included clinical measures of cognitive and functional impairment, biomarkers, and safety.\nRESULTS\nOf 88 Japanese participants (43 placebo, 45 donanemab), 7 in each group discontinued. Least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in iADRS score at week 76 was smaller with donanemab than with placebo in the combined (low-medium tau and high tau) and low-medium tau (N = 76) subpopulations (LSM change difference: 4.43 and 3.99, representing 38.8% and 40.2% slowing of disease progression, respectively). Slowing of AD progression with donanemab was also observed for other clinical outcomes. Marked decreases in amyloid plaque and plasma phosphorylated tau 217 were observed; amyloid clearance (< 24.1 Centiloids) was observed in 83.3% of the combined donanemab and 0% of the combined placebo groups. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema/effusions occurred in ten (22.2%) donanemab-treated participants (one [2.2%] symptomatic) and one (2.3%) placebo-treated participant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe overall efficacy and safety of donanemab in Japanese participants were similar to the global TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04437511."", ""year"": ""2024"", ""venue"": ""Neurology and therapy""}]}, ""timestamp"": ""2025-12-16T12:34:15.589849""}, {""tool_name"": ""google_search"", ""parameters"": {}, ""query"": ""36449413 ARIA-E placebo percentage"", ""result"": {""truncated"": true, ""preview"": ""{\""searchParameters\"": {\""q\"": \""36449413 ARIA-E placebo percentage\"", \""gl\"": \""us\"", \""hl\"": \""en\"", \""type\"": \""search\"", \""num\"": 10, \""engine\"": \""google\""}, \""organic\"": [{\""title\"": \""Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease\"", \""link\"": \""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36449413/\"", \""snippet\"": \""by CH van Dyck · 2023 · Cited by 5105 — PMID: 36449413 ...

Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3-6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E.

Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks.
