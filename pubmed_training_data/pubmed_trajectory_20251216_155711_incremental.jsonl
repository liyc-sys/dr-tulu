The rate and outcome of HPD in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are unknown.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo investigate whether HPD is observed in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with single-agent chemotherapy and whether there is an association between treatment and HPD.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nIn this multicenter retrospective study that included patients treated between August 4, 2011, and April 5, 2017, the setting was pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (8 institutions) or single-agent chemotherapy (4 institutions) in France. Measurable disease defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) on at least 2 computed tomographic scans before treatment and 1 computed tomographic scan during treatment was required.\nINTERVENTIONS\nThe tumor growth rate (TGR) before and during treatment and variation per month (ΔTGR) were calculated. Hyperprogressive disease was defined as disease progression at the first evaluation with ΔTGR exceeding 50%.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was assessment of the HPD rate in patients treated with IO or chemotherapy.\nRESULTS\nAmong 406 eligible patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (63.8% male), 46.3% (n = 188) were 65 years or older, 72.4% (n = 294) had nonsquamous histology, and 92.9% (n = 377) received a PD-1 inhibitor as monotherapy in second-line therapy or later. The median follow-up was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.1-13.8 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.0 months). Fifty-six patients (13.8%) were classified as having HPD. Pseudoprogression was observed in 4.7% (n = 19) of the population. Hyperprogressive disease was significantly associated with more than 2 metastatic sites before PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with non-HPD (62.5% [35 of 56] vs 42.6% [149 of 350]; P = .006). Patients experiencing HPD within the first 6 weeks of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment had significantly lower OS compared with patients with progressive disease (median OS, 3.4 months [95% CI, 2.8-7.5 months] vs 6.2 months [95% CI, 5.3-7.9 months]; hazard ratio, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.29-3.69]; P = .003). Among 59 eligible patients treated with chemotherapy, 3 (5.1%) were classified as having HPD.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nOur study suggests that HPD is more common with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with chemotherapy in pretreated patients with NSCLC and is also associated with high metastatic burden and poor prognosis in patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Additional studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in HPD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30657859\">Title: Novel patterns of response under immunotherapy.\nAuthors: Borcoman, E, Kanjanapan, Y, Champiat, S et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nAbstract: Novel patterns of response and progression to immunotherapy have been reported that are not observed with conventional cytotoxic or targeted anticancer treatments. A major breakthrough with immunotherapy is its potential to achieve durable responses in a subset of patients with advanced cancer that can be maintained several years even after stopping the treatment. No standardized definition of durable response exists in the literature, and the optimal duration of treatment in case of durable response is not clearly established. However, the majority of patients do not respond to immunotherapy. Initially reported in advanced melanoma patients, pseudoprogression occurs when tumor index lesions regress after initial progression, supporting the concept of treating some patients beyond progression. Overall, reported rates of pseudoprogression never exceeded 10%, meaning that the large majority of patients who have a disease progression will not eventually respond to treatment. The decision to pursue treatment beyond progression must therefore only be taken in carefully selected patients with clinical benefit, who did not experience severe toxicities with immunotherapy. Conversely, rapid progressions, called hyperprogressions, were reported by several teams with rates ranging from 4% to 29%. These observations need to be confirmed from randomized trials. It is essential to interrupt the treatment in patients with hyperprogression, in order to switch to another potentially active treatment. Finally, some patients experience dissociated responses, with some lesions shrinking and others growing. Local treatment with surgery or radiotherapy for growing lesions may be considered. Several immune-specific-related response criteria were developed to better capture benefits of immunotherapy. These criteria only address the pseudoprogression pattern of response, and do not capture the other patterns of response such as hyperprogression and dissociated response. The classic RECIST remains a reasonable and meaningful method to assess response to immunotherapy in the clinic.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">28706993 hyperprogressive disease</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 438 results.

Herein, our study reveals that pericancerous macrophages cross-present antigens to CD103 + CTLs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation machinery-mediated cytosolic pathway. This process leads to the retention of CD103 + CTLs in the pericancerous area, whereby they activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, promoting hepatoma progression and resistance to immunotherapy. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics analysis of HCC patients shows that despite their tissue-resident effector phenotype, the aggregation of CD103 + CTLs predicts unfavorable clinical outcomes for HCC patients receiving multiple types of treatment. Correspondingly, therapeutic strategies that redistribute CD103 + CTLs can disrupt this pathogenic interplay with macrophages, enhancing the efficacy of ICB treatment against HCC.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36601120\">Title: PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma immunotherapy.\nAuthors: Li, Qian, Han, Jingjing, Yang, Yonglin et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Frontiers in immunology\nAbstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high prevalence and mortality rate worldwide. Sorafenib monotherapy has been the standard of first-line treatment for advanced HCC for a long time, but there are still many shortcomings. In recent years, with the deepening of research on tumor immune microenvironment, researchers have begun to explore new approaches in immunotherapy, and the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has brought fundamental changes to the treatment of HCC. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint molecule that plays an important role in down-regulating immune system function and promoting tolerance. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1) is involved in tumor immune evasion by binding to PD-1, resulting in failure of treatment. Currently, immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has achieved unprecedented success in HCC, but it also faces great challenges, with its low remission rate still to be solved. For most patients with HCC, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the only rate limiting factor of antitumor immunity, and blocking only the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is not enough to stimulate an effective antitumor immune response; thus, combination therapy may be a better option. In this study, changes in the immune microenvironment of HCC patients were reviewed to clarify the feasibility of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, and a series of monotherapy and combination therapy clinical trials were summarized to verify the safety and efficacy of this newly developed treatment in patients with advanced HCC. Furthermore, we focused on hyperprogressive disease and drug resistance to gain a better understanding of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as a promising treatment.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31632773\">Title: Hyperprogressive disease with immunotherapy: new directions.\nAuthors: Lau, Sally C M, Leighl, Natasha B | Year: 2019 | Journal: Journal of thoracic disease\nAbstract: </snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33916696\">Title: Hyperprogressive Disease: Main Features and Key Controversies.\nAuthors: Arasanz, Hugo, Zuazo, Miren, Bocanegra, Ana et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: International journal of molecular sciences\nAbstract: Along with the positioning of immunotherapy as a preferential treatment for a wide variety of neoplasms, a new pattern of response consisting in a sudden acceleration of tumor growth has been described. This phenomenon has received the name of \"hyperprogressive disease\", and several definitions have been proposed for its identification, most of them relying on radiological criteria. However, due to the fact that the cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated yet, there is still some debate regarding whether this fast progression is induced by immunotherapy or only reflects the natural course of some highly aggressive neoplasms. Moreover, contradictory results of trials including patients with different cancer types suggest that both the incidence, the associated factors and the implications regarding prognosis might differ depending on tumor histology. This article intends to review the main publications regarding this matter and critically approach the most controversial aspects.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30361681\">Title: Hyperprogressive disease: recognizing a novel pattern to improve patient management.\nAuthors: Champiat, Stéphane, Ferrara, Roberto, Massard, Christophe et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Nature reviews. Clinical oncology\nAbstract: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies have substantially improved the overall survival of a subset of patients across multiple solid tumour types, but other patients can have a deterioration of their disease as a result of such therapies. This paradoxical phenomenon is defined as hyperprogression. In this Review, we present the available evidence of hyperprogressive disease following immune-checkpoint inhibition, the pathophysiological hypotheses that might explain hyperprogressive disease and the current challenges for patient management in routine clinical settings. Finally, we also discuss how the risk of hyperprogressive disease should be taken into account in clinical decisions involving immune-checkpoint inhibition.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">Champiat 2017 tumor growth rate</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 2 results.

The prevalence, the natural history, and the predictive factors of HPD in patients with cancer treated by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 remain unknown. Experimental Design: Medical records from all patients ( N = 218) prospectively treated in Gustave Roussy by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 within phase I clinical trials were analyzed. The tumor growth rate (TGR) prior (\"REFERENCE\"; REF) and upon (\"EXPERIMENTAL\"; EXP) anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was compared to identify patients with accelerated tumor growth. Associations between TGR, clinicopathologic characteristics, and overall survival (OS) were computed. Results: HPD was defined as a RECIST progression at the first evaluation and as a ≥2-fold increase of the TGR between the REF and the EXP periods. Of 131 evaluable patients, 12 patients (9%) were considered as having HPD. HPD was not associated with higher tumor burden at baseline, nor with any specific tumor type. At progression, patients with HPD had a lower rate of new lesions than patients with disease progression without HPD ( P < 0.05). HPD is associated with a higher age ( P < 0.05) and a worse outcome (overall survival). Interestingly, REF TGR (before treatment) was inversely correlated with response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ( P < 0.05) therapy. Conclusions: A novel aggressive pattern of hyperprogression exists in a fraction of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1. This observation raises some concerns about treating elderly patients (>65 years old) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and suggests further study of this phenomenon.

Oncology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nBecause responses of patients with cancer to immunotherapy can vary in success, innovative predictors of response to treatment are urgently needed to improve treatment outcomes. We aimed to develop and independently validate a radiomics-based biomarker of tumour-infiltrating CD8 cells in patients included in phase 1 trials of anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy. We also aimed to evaluate the association between the biomarker, and tumour immune phenotype and clinical outcomes of these patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this retrospective multicohort study, we used four independent cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours to develop and validate a radiomic signature predictive of immunotherapy response by combining contrast-enhanced CT images and RNA-seq genomic data from tumour biopsies to assess CD8 cell tumour infiltration. To develop the radiomic signature of CD8 cells, we used the CT images and RNA sequencing data of 135 patients with advanced solid malignant tumours who had been enrolled into the MOSCATO trial between May 1, 2012, and March 31, 2016, in France (training set). The genomic data, which are based on the CD8B gene, were used to estimate the abundance of CD8 cells in the samples and data were then aligned with the images to generate the radiomic signatures. The concordance of the radiomic signature (primary endpoint) was validated in a Cancer Genome Atlas [TGCA] database dataset including 119 patients who had available baseline preoperative imaging data and corresponding transcriptomic data on June 30, 2017. From 84 input variables used for the machine-learning method (78 radiomic features, five location variables, and one technical variable), a radiomics-based predictor of the CD8 cell expression signature was built by use of machine learning (elastic-net regularised regression method). Two other independent cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours were used to evaluate this predictor. The immune phenotype internal cohort (n=100), were randomly selected from the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus database of patient medical records based on previously described, extreme tumour-immune phenotypes: immune-inflamed (with dense CD8 cell infiltration) or immune-desert (with low CD8 cell infiltration), irrespective of treatment delivered; these data were used to analyse the correlation of the immune phenotype with this biomarker. Finally, the immunotherapy-treated dataset (n=137) of patients recruited from Dec 1, 2011, to Jan 31, 2014, at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, who had been treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in phase 1 trials, was used to assess the predictive value of this biomarker in terms of clinical outcome.\nFINDINGS\nWe developed a radiomic signature for CD8 cells that included eight variables, which was validated with the gene expression signature of CD8 cells in the TCGA dataset (area under the curve [AUC]=0·67; 95% CI 0·57-0·77; p=0·0019). In the cohort with assumed immune phenotypes, the signature was also able to discriminate inflamed tumours from immune-desert tumours (0·76; 0·66-0·86; p<0·0001). In patients treated with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1, a high baseline radiomic score (relative to the median) was associated with a higher proportion of patients who achieved an objective response at 3 months (vs those with progressive disease or stable disease; p=0·049) and a higher proportion of patients who had an objective response (vs those with progressive disease or stable disease; p=0·025) or stable disease (vs those with progressive disease; p=0·013) at 6 months. A high baseline radiomic score was also associated with improved overall survival in univariate (median overall survival 24·3 months in the high radiomic score group, 95% CI 18·63-42·1; vs 11·5 months in the low radiomic score group, 7·98-15·6; hazard ratio 0·58, 95% CI 0·39-0·87; p=0·0081) and multivariate analyses (0·52, 0·35-0·79; p=0·0022).\nINTERPRETATION\nThe radiomic signature of CD8 cells was validated in three independent cohorts. This imaging predictor provided a promising way to predict the immune phenotype of tumours and to infer clinical outcomes for patients with cancer who had been treated with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1. Our imaging biomarker could be useful in estimating CD8 cell count and predicting clinical outcomes of patients treated with immunotherapy, when validated by further prospective randomised trials.\nFUNDING\nFondation pour la Recherche Médicale, and SIRIC-SOCRATE 2.0, French Society of Radiation Oncology.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37752094\">Title: Development and validation of a risk-prediction model for immune-related adverse events in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.\nAuthors: Qiu, Qing, Wu, Chenghao, Tang, Wenxiao et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B\nAbstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is the most common cancer in males. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have achieved impressive efficacy in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Pardoll, 2012; Champiat et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2022). Although ICIs are usually well tolerated, they are often accompanied by immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (Doroshow et al., 2019). Non-specific activation of the immune system produces off-target immune and inflammatory responses that can affect virtually any organ or system (O'Kane et al., 2017; Puzanov et al., 2017). Compared with adverse events caused by chemotherapy, irAEs are often characterized by delayed onset and prolonged duration and can occur in any organ at any stage of treatment, including after cessation of treatment (Puzanov et al., 2017; von Itzstein et al., 2020). They range from rash, pneumonitis, hypothyroidism, enterocolitis, and autoimmune hepatitis to cardiovascular, hematological, renal, neurological, and ophthalmic irAEs (Nishino et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2017; Song et al., 2020). Hence, we conducted a retrospective study to identify validated factors that could predict the magnitude of the risk of irAEs in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; our approach was to analyze the correlation between the clinical characteristics of patients at the start of treatment and relevant indicators such as hematological indices and the risk of developing irAEs. Then, we developed an economical, practical, rapid, and simple model to assess the risk of irAEs in patients receiving ICI treatment, as early as possible.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29254505\">Title: Anti-PD-1 Vasculitis of the central nervous system or radionecrosis?\nAuthors: Sun, Roger, Danlos, Francois-Xavier, Ammari, Samy et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: Journal for immunotherapy of cancer\nAbstract: Commentary on « Cerebral vasculitis mimicking intracranial metastatic progression of lung cancer during PD-1 blockade » by Läubli H et al., J Immunother Cancer. 2017;5:46.The authors diagnosed a cerebral tumor-like lymphocytic vasculitis associated with anti-endothelial cell auto-antibodies secondary to anti-PD-1 therapy, treated by surgical resection and corticosteroids.

Conversely, rapid progressions, called hyperprogressions, were reported by several teams with rates ranging from 4% to 29%. These observations need to be confirmed from randomized trials. It is essential to interrupt the treatment in patients with hyperprogression, in order to switch to another potentially active treatment. Finally, some patients experience dissociated responses, with some lesions shrinking and others growing. Local treatment with surgery or radiotherapy for growing lesions may be considered. Several immune-specific-related response criteria were developed to better capture benefits of immunotherapy. These criteria only address the pseudoprogression pattern of response, and do not capture the other patterns of response such as hyperprogression and dissociated response.

Sorafenib monotherapy has been the standard of first-line treatment for advanced HCC for a long time, but there are still many shortcomings. In recent years, with the deepening of research on tumor immune microenvironment, researchers have begun to explore new approaches in immunotherapy, and the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has brought fundamental changes to the treatment of HCC. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint molecule that plays an important role in down-regulating immune system function and promoting tolerance. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1) is involved in tumor immune evasion by binding to PD-1, resulting in failure of treatment. Currently, immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has achieved unprecedented success in HCC, but it also faces great challenges, with its low remission rate still to be solved. For most patients with HCC, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is not the only rate limiting factor of antitumor immunity, and blocking only the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is not enough to stimulate an effective antitumor immune response; thus, combination therapy may be a better option. In this study, changes in the immune microenvironment of HCC patients were reviewed to clarify the feasibility of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, and a series of monotherapy and combination therapy clinical trials were summarized to verify the safety and efficacy of this newly developed treatment in patients with advanced HCC.

The prevalence, the natural history, and the predictive factors of HPD in patients with cancer treated by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 remain unknown. Experimental Design: Medical records from all patients ( N = 218) prospectively treated in Gustave Roussy by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 within phase I clinical trials were analyzed. The tumor growth rate (TGR) prior (\"REFERENCE\"; REF) and upon (\"EXPERIMENTAL\"; EXP) anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was compared to identify patients with accelerated tumor growth. Associations between TGR, clinicopathologic characteristics, and overall survival (OS) were computed. Results: HPD was defined as a RECIST progression at the first evaluation and as a ≥2-fold increase of the TGR between the REF and the EXP periods. Of 131 evaluable patients, 12 patients (9%) were considered as having HPD. HPD was not associated with higher tumor burden at baseline, nor with any specific tumor type. At progression, patients with HPD had a lower rate of new lesions than patients with disease progression without HPD ( P < 0.05). HPD is associated with a higher age ( P < 0.05) and a worse outcome (overall survival). Interestingly, REF TGR (before treatment) was inversely correlated with response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 ( P < 0.05) therapy. Conclusions: A novel aggressive pattern of hyperprogression exists in a fraction of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1. This observation raises some concerns about treating elderly patients (>65 years old) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and suggests further study of this phenomenon.

Measurable disease defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) on at least 2 computed tomographic scans before treatment and 1 computed tomographic scan during treatment was required.\nINTERVENTIONS\nThe tumor growth rate (TGR) before and during treatment and variation per month (ΔTGR) were calculated. Hyperprogressive disease was defined as disease progression at the first evaluation with ΔTGR exceeding 50%.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was assessment of the HPD rate in patients treated with IO or chemotherapy.\nRESULTS\nAmong 406 eligible patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (63.8% male), 46.3% (n = 188) were 65 years or older, 72.4% (n = 294) had nonsquamous histology, and 92.9% (n = 377) received a PD-1 inhibitor as monotherapy in second-line therapy or later. The median follow-up was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.1-13.8 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.0 months). Fifty-six patients (13.8%) were classified as having HPD. Pseudoprogression was observed in 4.7% (n = 19) of the population. Hyperprogressive disease was significantly associated with more than 2 metastatic sites before PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with non-HPD (62.5% [35 of 56] vs 42.6% [149 of 350]; P = .006). Patients experiencing HPD within the first 6 weeks of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment had significantly lower OS compared with patients with progressive disease (median OS, 3.4 months [95% CI, 2.8-7.5 months] vs 6.2 months [95% CI, 5.3-7.9 months]; hazard ratio, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.29-3.69]; P = .003). Among 59 eligible patients treated with chemotherapy, 3 (5.1%) were classified as having HPD.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nOur study suggests that HPD is more common with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with chemotherapy in pretreated patients with NSCLC and is also associated with high metastatic burden and poor prognosis in patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

We found that increased frequency of TH17 cells correlates with high disease activity and with specific alterations of the gut mucosa-associated microbiota in MS patients. By using 16 _S_ ribosomal RNA sequencing, we analyzed the microbiota isolated from small intestinal tissues and found that MS patients with high disease activity and increased intestinal TH17 cell frequency showed a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, increased relative abundance of _Streptococcus_ , and decreased _Prevotella_ strains compared to healthy controls and MS patients with no disease activity. We demonstrated that the intestinal TH17 cell frequency is inversely related to the relative abundance of _Prevotella_ strains in the human small intestine. Our data demonstrate that brain autoimmunity is associated with specific microbiota modifications and excessive TH17 cell expansion in the human intestine. \\n##  Publication types \\n  * Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't \\n\\n\\n##  MeSH terms \\n  * Adult \\n  * Biomarkers \\n  * Biopsy \\n  * Female \\n  * Gastrointestinal Microbiome* \\n  * Humans \\n  * Immunity, Mucosal \\n  * Lymphocyte Count* \\n  * Magnetic Resonance Imaging \\n  * Male \\n  * Middle Aged \\n  * Multiple Sclerosis / diagnosis* \\n  * Multiple Sclerosis / etiology* \\n  * Peyer's Patches* \\n  * Severity of Illness Index \\n  * T-Lymphocyte Subsets / i"}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:31:10.217415"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "28706993 Champiat 2017", "result": {"total": 34, "data": [{"paperId": "28258060", "title": "Can an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (Sometimes) Make Things Worse?", "abstract": "Champiat and colleagues suggest that a small subset of patients at their center treated with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors appear to exhibit hyperprogression of disease.

We aimed to develop and independently validate a radiomics-based biomarker of tumour-infiltrating CD8 cells in patients included in phase 1 trials of anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy. We also aimed to evaluate the association between the biomarker, and tumour immune phenotype and clinical outcomes of these patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this retrospective multicohort study, we used four independent cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours to develop and validate a radiomic signature predictive of immunotherapy response by combining contrast-enhanced CT images and RNA-seq genomic data from tumour biopsies to assess CD8 cell tumour infiltration. To develop the radiomic signature of CD8 cells, we used the CT images and RNA sequencing data of 135 patients with advanced solid malignant tumours who had been enrolled into the MOSCATO trial between May 1, 2012, and March 31, 2016, in France (training set). The genomic data, which are based on the CD8B gene, were used to estimate the abundance of CD8 cells in the samples and data were then aligned with the images to generate the radiomic signatures. The concordance of the radiomic signature (primary endpoint) was validated in a Cancer Genome Atlas [TGCA] database dataset including 119 patients who had available baseline preoperative imaging data and corresponding transcriptomic data on June 30, 2017. From 84 input variables used for the machine-learning method (78 radiomic features, five location variables, and one technical variable), a radiomics-based predictor of the CD8 cell expression signature was built by use of machine learning (elastic-net regularised regression method). Two other independent cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours were used to evaluate this predictor. The immune phenotype internal cohort (n=100), were randomly selected from the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus database of patient medical records based on previously described, extreme tumour-immune phenotypes: immune-inflamed (with dense CD8 cell infiltration) or immune-desert (with low CD8 cell infiltration), irrespective of treatment delivered; these data were used to analyse the correlation of the immune phenotype with this biomarker. Finally, the immunotherapy-treated dataset (n=137) of patients recruited from Dec 1, 2011, to Jan 31, 2014, at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, who had been treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in phase 1 trials, was used to assess the predictive value of this biomarker in terms of clinical outcome.\nFINDINGS\nWe developed a radiomic signature for CD8 cells that included eight variables, which was validated with the gene expression signature of CD8 cells in the TCGA dataset (area under the curve [AUC]=0·67; 95% CI 0·57-0·77; p=0·0019). In the cohort with assumed immune phenotypes, the signature was also able to discriminate inflamed tumours from immune-desert tumours (0·76; 0·66-0·86; p<0·0001). In patients treated with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1, a high baseline radiomic score (relative to the median) was associated with a higher proportion of patients who achieved an objective response at 3 months (vs those with progressive disease or stable disease; p=0·049) and a higher proportion of patients who had an objective response (vs those with progressive disease or stable disease; p=0·025) or stable disease (vs those with progressive disease; p=0·013) at 6 months. A high baseline radiomic score was also associated with improved overall survival in univariate (median overall survival 24·3 months in the high radiomic score group, 95% CI 18·63-42·1; vs 11·5 months in the low radiomic score group, 7·98-15·6; hazard ratio 0·58, 95% CI 0·39-0·87; p=0·0081) and multivariate analyses (0·52, 0·35-0·79; p=0·0022).\nINTERPRETATION\nThe radiomic signature of CD8 cells was validated in three independent cohorts. This imaging predictor provided a promising way to predict the immune phenotype of tumours and to infer clinical outcomes for patients with cancer who had been treated with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1. Our imaging biomarker could be useful in estimating CD8 cell count and predicting clinical outcomes of patients treated with immunotherapy, when validated by further prospective randomised trials.\nFUNDING\nFondation pour la Recherche Médicale, and SIRIC-SOCRATE 2.0, French Society of Radiation Oncology.", "year": "2018", "venue": "The Lancet.

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have achieved impressive efficacy in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Pardoll, 2012; Champiat et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2022). Although ICIs are usually well tolerated, they are often accompanied by immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (Doroshow et al., 2019). Non-specific activation of the immune system produces off-target immune and inflammatory responses that can affect virtually any organ or system (O'Kane et al., 2017; Puzanov et al., 2017). Compared with adverse events caused by chemotherapy, irAEs are often characterized by delayed onset and prolonged duration and can occur in any organ at any stage of treatment, including after cessation of treatment (Puzanov et al., 2017; von Itzstein et al., 2020). They range from rash, pneumonitis, hypothyroidism, enterocolitis, and autoimmune hepatitis to cardiovascular, hematological, renal, neurological, and ophthalmic irAEs (Nishino et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2017; Song et al., 2020). Hence, we conducted a retrospective study to identify validated factors that could predict the magnitude of the risk of irAEs in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; our approach was to analyze the correlation between the clinical characteristics of patients at the start of treatment and relevant indicators such as hematological indices and the risk of developing irAEs.

The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure) or cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS\nOver a median of 18.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 386 of 2373 patients (16.3%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 of 2371 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). A first worsening heart failure event occurred in 237 patients (10.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 326 patients (13.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.83). Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 227 patients (9.6%) in the dapagliflozin group and in 273 patients (11.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.98); 276 patients (11.6%) and 329 patients (13.9%), respectively, died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97). Findings in patients with diabetes were similar to those in patients without diabetes. The frequency of adverse events related to volume depletion, renal dysfunction, and hypoglycemia did not differ between treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, the risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes was lower among those who received dapagliflozin than among those who received placebo, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

The effect of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on the composite of the first occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. A serious ventricular arrhythmia was reported in 115 (2.4%) of the 4744 patients in DAPA-HF (ventricular fibrillation in 15 patients, ventricular tachycardia in 86, 'other' ventricular arrhythmia/tachyarrhythmia in 12, and torsade de pointes in 2 patients). A total of 206 (41%) of the 500 cardiovascular deaths occurred suddenly. Eight patients survived resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Independent predictors of the composite outcome (first occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest or sudden death), ranked by chi-square value, were log-transformed N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, history of ventricular arrhythmia, left ventricular ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, male sex, body mass index, serum sodium concentration, non-white race, treatment with dapagliflozin, and cardiac resynchronization therapy. Of participants assigned to dapagliflozin, 140/2373 patients (5.9%) experienced the composite outcome compared with 175/2371 patients (7.4%) in the placebo group [hazard ratio 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.99), P = 0.037], and the effect was consistent across each of the components of the composite outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDapagliflozin reduced the risk of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or sudden death when added to conventional therapy in patients with HFrEF.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov unique identifier: NCT03036124 (DAPA-HF).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32877652\">Title: SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a meta-analysis of the EMPEROR-Reduced and DAPA-HF trials.\nAuthors: Zannad, Faiez, Ferreira, João Pedro, Pocock, Stuart J et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Lancet (London, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nBoth DAPA-HF (assessing dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-Reduced (assessing empagliflozin) trials showed that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with or without diabetes. However, neither trial was powered to assess effects on cardiovascular death or all-cause death or to characterise effects in clinically important subgroups. Using study-level published data from DAPA-HF and patient-level data from EMPEROR-Reduced, we aimed to estimate the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on fatal and non-fatal heart failure events and renal outcomes in all randomly assigned patients with HFrEF and in relevant subgroups from DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials.\nMETHODS\nWe did a prespecified meta-analysis of the two single large-scale trials assessing the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes: DAPA-HF (assessing dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-Reduced (assessing empagliflozin). The primary endpoint was time to all-cause death. Additionally, we assessed the effects of treatment in prespecified subgroups on the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. These subgroups were based on type 2 diabetes status, age, sex, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) treatment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, race, history of hospitalisation for heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body-mass index, and region (post-hoc). We used hazard ratios (HRs) derived from Cox proportional hazard models for time-to-first event endpoints and Cochran's Q test for treatment interactions; the analysis of recurrent events was based on rate ratios derived from the Lin-Wei-Yang-Ying model.\nFINDINGS\nAmong 8474 patients combined from both trials, the estimated treatment effect was a 13% reduction in all-cause death (pooled HR 0·87, 95% CI 0·77-0·98; p=0·018) and 14% reduction in cardiovascular death (0·86, 0·76-0·98; p=0·027). SGLT2 inhibition was accompanied by a 26% relative reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death or first hospitalisation for heart failure (0·74, 0·68-0·82; p<0·0001), and by a 25% decrease in the composite of recurrent hospitalisations for heart failure or cardiovascular death (0·75, 0·68-0·84; p<0·0001). The risk of the composite renal endpoint was also reduced (0·62, 0·43-0·90; p=0·013). All tests for heterogeneity of effect size between trials were not significant. The pooled treatment effects showed consistent benefits for subgroups based on age, sex, diabetes, treatment with an ARNI and baseline eGFR, but suggested treatment-by-subgroup interactions for subgroups based on NYHA functional class and race.\nINTERPRETATION\nThe effects of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on hospitalisations for heart failure were consistent in the two independent trials and suggest that these agents also improve renal outcomes and reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with HFrEF.\nFUNDING\nBoehringer Ingelheim.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32219386\">Title: Effect of Dapagliflozin on Worsening Heart Failure and Cardiovascular Death in Patients With Heart Failure With and Without Diabetes.\nAuthors: Petrie, Mark C, Verma, Subodh, Docherty, Kieran F et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAdditional treatments are needed for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

In patients with a glycated hemoglobin of at least 5.7%, the primary outcome occurred in 118 of 860 patients (13.7%) in the dapagliflozin group and 160 of 888 (18.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59-0.94]) (P value for interaction = .72). Volume depletion was reported as an adverse event in 7.3% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6.1% in the placebo group among patients without diabetes and in 7.8% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 7.8% in the placebo group among patients with diabetes.

A patient-level pooled meta-analysis of two trials testing dapagliflozin in participants with heart failure and different ranges of left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40% and >40%) was pre-specified to examine the effect of treatment on endpoints that neither trial, individually, was powered for and to test the consistency of the effect of dapagliflozin across the range of ejection fractions. The pre-specified endpoints were: death from cardiovascular causes; death from any cause; total hospital admissions for heart failure; and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs)). A total of 11,007 participants with a mean ejection fraction of 44% (s.d. 14%) were included. Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.97; P = 0.01), death from any cause (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99; P = 0.03), total hospital admissions for heart failure (rate ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.65-0.78; P < 0.001) and MACEs (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-1.00; P = 0.045). There was no evidence that the effect of dapagliflozin differed by ejection fraction.

More evidence is needed regarding the effects of these drugs in patients across the broad spectrum of heart failure, including those with a markedly reduced ejection fraction.\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 3730 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure.\nRESULTS\nDuring a median of 16 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 361 of 1863 patients (19.4%) in the empagliflozin group and in 462 of 1867 patients (24.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.86; P<0.001). The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85; P<0.001). The annual rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was slower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (-0.55 vs. -2.28 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area per year, P<0.001), and empagliflozin-treated patients had a lower risk of serious renal outcomes. Uncomplicated genital tract infection was reported more frequently with empagliflozin.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients receiving recommended therapy for heart failure, those in the empagliflozin group had a lower risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure than those in the placebo group, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

We prospectively collected information on inpatient and outpatient events reflecting worsening heart failure and prespecified their analysis in individual and composite end points.\nRESULTS\nEmpagliflozin reduced the combined risk of death, hospitalization for heart failure or an emergent/urgent heart failure visit requiring intravenous treatment (415 versus 519 patients; empagliflozin versus placebo, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.87; P <0.0001). This benefit reached statistical significance at 12 days after randomization. Empagliflozin reduced the total number of heart failure hospitalizations that required intensive care (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.90; P =0.008) and that required a vasopressor or positive inotropic drug or mechanical or surgical intervention (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-0.87; P =0.005). As compared with placebo, fewer patients in the empagliflozin group reported intensification of diuretics (297 versus 414 [HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.78; P <0.0001]). Additionally, patients assigned to empagliflozin were 20% to 40% more likely to experience an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class and were 20% to 40% less likely to experience worsening of New York Heart Association functional class, with statistically significant effects that were apparent 28 days after randomization and maintained during long-term follow-up. The risk of any inpatient or outpatient worsening heart failure event in the placebo group was high (48.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up), and it was reduced by empagliflozin (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63-0.78; P <0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, empagliflozin reduced the risk and total number of inpatient and outpatient worsening heart failure events, with benefits seen early after initiation of treatment and sustained for the duration of double-blind therapy.

We prespecified a comparison of the effect of empagliflozin in patients with and without diabetes.\nRESULTS\nOf the 3730 patients enrolled, 1856 (50%) had diabetes, 1268 (34%) had prediabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 5.7-6.4%), and 606 (16%) had normoglycemia (HbA1c <5.7%). The risks of the primary outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure), total hospitalizations for heart failure, and adverse renal outcomes were higher in patients with diabetes, but were similar between patients with prediabetes and normoglycemia. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome in patients with and without diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.87] and 0.78 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97], respectively, P -interaction=0.57). Patients with and without diabetes also did not differ with respect to the effect of empagliflozin on total hospitalizations for heart failure, on the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate over time, and on the risk of serious adverse renal outcomes. Among these end points, the effects of the drug did not differ in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia. When analyzed as a continuous variable, baseline HbA1c did not significantly modify the benefits of empagliflozin on the primary outcome ( P -interaction=0.40). Empagliflozin did not lower HbA1c in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia and was not associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin significantly improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, independent of baseline diabetes status and across the continuum of HbA1c.

At the end of the trials, 6799 patients (placebo 3381, empagliflozin 3418) were prospectively withdrawn from treatment in a blinded manner, and, of these, 3981 patients (placebo 2020, empagliflozin 1961) underwent prespecified in-person assessments after ≈30 days off treatment.\nRESULTS\nFrom 90 days from the start of closeout to the end of double-blind treatment, the annualized risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was lower in empagliflozin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.7 [95% CI, 9.0-12.6] versus 13.5 [95% CI, 11.5-15.6] events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60-0.96]). When the study drugs were withdrawn for ≈30 days, the annualized risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure increased in patients withdrawn from empagliflozin but not in those withdrawn from placebo (17.0 [95% CI, 12.6-22.1] versus 14.1 [95% CI, 10.1-18.8] events per 100 patient-years for empagliflozin and placebo, respectively). The hazard ratio for the change in risk in the patients withdrawn from empagliflozin was 1.75 (95% CI, 1.20-2.54), P =0.0034, whereas the change in the risk in patients withdrawn from placebo was not significant (hazard ratio 1.12 [95% CI, 0.76-1.66]); time period-by-treatment interaction, P =0.068. After withdrawal, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score declined by 1.6±0.4 in patients withdrawn from empagliflozin versus placebo ( P <0.0001).

When analyzed as a continuous variable, baseline HbA1c did not significantly modify the benefits of empagliflozin on the primary outcome ( P -interaction=0.40). Empagliflozin did not lower HbA1c in patients with prediabetes or normoglycemia and was not associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin significantly improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, independent of baseline diabetes status and across the continuum of HbA1c.

The ability to efficiently convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C could therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with previous base editors, ABEs enable the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31332326\">Title: Continuous evolution of base editors with expanded target compatibility and improved activity.\nAuthors: Thuronyi, B W, Koblan, Luke W, Levy, Jonathan M et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Nature biotechnology\nAbstract: Base editors use DNA-modifying enzymes targeted with a catalytically impaired CRISPR protein to precisely install point mutations. Here, we develop phage-assisted continuous evolution of base editors (BE-PACE) to improve their editing efficiency and target sequence compatibility. We used BE-PACE to evolve cytosine base editors (CBEs) that overcome target sequence context constraints of canonical CBEs. One evolved CBE, evoAPOBEC1-BE4max, is up to 26-fold more efficient at editing cytosine in the GC context, a disfavored context for wild-type APOBEC1 deaminase, while maintaining efficient editing in all other sequence contexts tested. Another evolved deaminase, evoFERNY, is 29% smaller than APOBEC1 and edits efficiently in all tested sequence contexts. We also evolved a CBE based on CDA1 deaminase with much higher editing efficiency at difficult target sites. Finally, we used data from evolved CBEs to illuminate the relationship between deaminase activity, base editing efficiency, editing window width and byproduct formation. These findings establish a system for rapid evolution of base editors and inform their use and improvement.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36357717\">Title: Re-engineering the adenine deaminase TadA-8e for efficient and specific CRISPR-based cytosine base editing.\nAuthors: Chen, Liang, Zhu, Biyun, Ru, Gaomeng et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Nature biotechnology\nAbstract: Cytosine base editors (CBEs) efficiently generate precise C·G-to-T·A base conversions, but the activation-induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (AID/APOBEC) protein family deaminase component induces considerable off-target effects and indels. To explore unnatural cytosine deaminases, we repurpose the adenine deaminase TadA-8e for cytosine conversion. The introduction of an N46L variant in TadA-8e eliminates its adenine deaminase activity and results in a TadA-8e-derived C-to-G base editor (Td-CGBE) capable of highly efficient and precise C·G-to-G·C editing. Through fusion with uracil glycosylase inhibitors and further introduction of additional variants, a series of Td-CBEs was obtained either with a high activity similar to that of BE4max or with higher precision compared to other reported accurate CBEs. Td-CGBE/Td-CBEs show very low indel effects and a background level of Cas9-dependent or Cas9-independent DNA/RNA off-target editing. Moreover, Td-CGBE/Td-CBEs are more efficient in generating accurate edits in homopolymeric cytosine sites in cells or mouse embryos, suggesting their accuracy and safety for gene therapy and other applications.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32284612\">Title: Therapeutic base editing of human hematopoietic stem cells.\nAuthors: Zeng, Jing, Wu, Yuxuan, Ren, Chunyan et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Nature medicine\nAbstract: Base editing by nucleotide deaminases linked to programmable DNA-binding proteins represents a promising approach to permanently remedy blood disorders, although its application in engrafting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains unexplored. In this study, we purified A3A (N57Q)-BE3 base editor for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) electroporation of human-peripheral-blood-mobilized CD34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We observed frequent on-target cytosine base edits at the BCL11A erythroid enhancer at +58 with few indels. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in erythroid progeny after base editing or nuclease editing was similar. A single therapeutic base edit of the BCL11A enhancer prevented sickling and ameliorated globin chain imbalance in erythroid progeny from sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia patient-derived HSPCs, respectively. Moreover, efficient multiplex editing could be achieved with combined disruption of the BCL11A erythroid enhancer and correction of the HBB -28A>G promoter mutation. Finally, base edits could be produced in multilineage-repopulating self-renewing human HSCs with high frequency as assayed in primary and secondary recipient animals resulting in potent HbF induction in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of RNP base editing of human HSPCs as a feasible alternative to nuclease editing for HSC-targeted therapeutic genome modification.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40883747\">Title: Cytosine base editor-DNA binding domain fusions for editing window modulation in the RNP format.\nAuthors: Brettmann, Erin, Chen, Fuqiang, Beishir, Stephen et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: BMC biotechnology\nAbstract: Base editing technologies allow for the precise and efficient installation of defined nucleotide substitutions into a target genome without the introduction of double strand breaks or DNA templates. Here we describe two recombinant, protein format cytosine base editors (CBEs) that efficiently catalyze the installation of cytosine-to-thymine edits, termed \"Flexible\" and \"Precision.\" Flexible exhibits a wide editing window, while Precision uses a fused single-stranded DNA binding protein to narrow the editing window, lowering the risk of editing multiple cytosine residues at the target site. We show that co-transfection with uracil glycosylase inhibitor protein increases the proportion of substitutions that are C-to-T and the ratio of C-to-T editing to indel formation, thus reducing undesired editing outcomes. We use in vitro editing assays to characterize our editors and show a preference for cytosine residues preceded by thymine (TpC dinucleotides) and unmethylated cytosine residues.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">Komor 2016 base editing</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 4 results.

Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1%) indel formation.

Years later, enabled largely by the development of CRISPR-based genome editing tools, the field has exploded, with academic labs, startup biotechnology companies, and large pharmaceutical corporations working in concert to develop life-changing therapeutics. In this Essay, we highlight base editing technologies and their development from bench to bedside. Base editing, first reported in 2016, is capable of installing C•G to T•A and A•T to G•C point mutations, while largely circumventing some of the pitfalls of traditional CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Despite their youth, these technologies have been widely used by both academic labs and therapeutics-based companies.

The mechanism of PE makes it less dependent on cellular replication and endogenous DNA repair than homology-directed repair-based approaches, and its ability to precisely install edits without creating DSBs minimizes indels and other undesired outcomes. The capabilities of PE have also expanded since its original publication. Enhanced PE systems, PE4 and PE5, manipulate DNA repair pathways to increase PE efficiency and reduce indels. Other advances that improve PE efficiency include engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), which include a structured RNA motif to stabilize and protect pegRNA 3' ends, and the PEmax architecture, which improves editor expression and nuclear localization. New applications such as twin PE (twinPE) can precisely insert or delete hundreds of base pairs of DNA and can be used in tandem with recombinases to achieve gene-sized (&gt;5 kb) insertions and inversions. Achieving optimal PE requires careful experimental design, and the large number of parameters that influence PE outcomes can be daunting. This protocol describes current best practices for conducting PE and twinPE experiments and describes the design and optimization of pegRNAs. We also offer guidelines for how to select the proper PE system (PE1 to PE5 and twinPE) for a given application. Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to perform PE in mammalian cells. Compared with other procedures for editing human cells, PE offers greater precision and versatility, and can be completed within 2-4 weeks.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34887556\">Title: Programmable deletion, replacement, integration and inversion of large DNA sequences with twin prime editing.\nAuthors: Anzalone, Andrew V, Gao, Xin D, Podracky, Christopher J et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature biotechnology\nAbstract: The targeted deletion, replacement, integration or inversion of genomic sequences could be used to study or treat human genetic diseases, but existing methods typically require double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that lead to undesired consequences, including uncontrolled indel mixtures and chromosomal abnormalities. Here we describe twin prime editing (twinPE), a DSB-independent method that uses a prime editor protein and two prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) for the programmable replacement or excision of DNA sequences at endogenous human genomic sites. The two pegRNAs template the synthesis of complementary DNA flaps on opposing strands of genomic DNA, which replace the endogenous DNA sequence between the prime-editor-induced nick sites. When combined with a site-specific serine recombinase, twinPE enabled targeted integration of gene-sized DNA plasmids (>5,000 bp) and targeted sequence inversions of 40 kb in human cells. TwinPE expands the capabilities of precision gene editing and might synergize with other tools for the correction or complementation of large or complex human pathogenic alleles.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27096365\">Title: Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage.\nAuthors: Komor, Alexis C, Kim, Yongjoo B, Packer, Michael S et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Nature\nAbstract: Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction.

Using parallel in-pool profiling of Cas9-induced insertions and deletions (indels) within a genome-wide knockout library, we present a comprehensive catalog that assesses the influence of nearly every human gene on DSB repair outcomes.

Three generations of programmable nucleases (ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-Cas system) have been adopted to introduce targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic cells. DNA repair machinery of the cells has been exploited to introduce insertion and deletions (indels) at the targeted DSBs to study function of any gene-of-interest. The resulting indels were generally assumed to be \"random\" events produced by \"error-prone\" DNA repair pathways. However, recent advances in computational tools developed to study the Cas9-induced mutations have changed the consensus and implied the \"non-randomness\" nature of these mutations. Furthermore, CRISPR-centric tools are evolving at an unprecedented pace, for example, base- and prime-editors are the newest developments that have been added to the genome editing toolbox. Altogether, genome editing tools have revolutionized our way of conducting research in life sciences. Here, we present a concise overview of genome editing tools and describe the DNA repair pathways underlying the generation of genome editing outcome.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\nIn the original cytosine base editing paper, the main “bystander” effect was **editing of additional cytidines near the intended target**: Komor et al. reported that their cytosine base editors convert cytidines within an **~5-nucleotide editing window**, meaning **any C within that window can also be converted (C→T / G→A)** (i.e., bystander base conversions within the window) <cite id=\"27096365\">Komor AC et al., Nature 2016 (base editors convert cytidines within ~5-nt window)</cite>.\n\nFor **indel formation**, Komor et al. reported that in multiple mammalian cell lines, optimized editors (2nd/3rd generation; including UGI and nickase strategies) achieved ~15–75% base conversion with **minimal indels, typically ≤1%** <cite id=\"27096365\">Komor AC et al., Nature 2016 (typically ≤1% indels)</cite>.\n\nBy contrast, classic CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease editing is built around **double-strand DNA break formation** (the initiating lesion that then gets repaired, often yielding indels) <cite id=\"22745249\">Jinek M et al., Science 2012 (Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that cleaves DNA, generating DSBs)</cite>.

The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells.

In a phase 2 trial involving patients who were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del-minimal function genotype), the next-generation CFTR corrector elexacaftor, in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, improved Phe508del CFTR function and clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients 12 years of age or older with cystic fibrosis with Phe508del-minimal function genotypes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was absolute change from baseline in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) at week 4.\nRESULTS\nA total of 403 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of active treatment or placebo. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, relative to placebo, resulted in a percentage of predicted FEV 1 that was 13.8 points higher at 4 weeks and 14.3 points higher through 24 weeks, a rate of pulmonary exacerbations that was 63% lower, a respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher patient-reported quality of life with regard to respiratory symptoms; minimum clinically important difference, 4 points) that was 20.2 points higher, and a sweat chloride concentration that was 41.8 mmol per liter lower (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was generally safe and had an acceptable side-effect profile. Most patients had adverse events that were mild or moderate. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen occurred in 1% of the patients in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nElexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was efficacious in patients with cystic fibrosis with Phe508del-minimal function genotypes, in whom previous CFTR modulator regimens were ineffective.

The objective of this study was a systematic research of the literature on the efficacy and safety of this CFTR modulator on patients with CF. A search of Pubmed was conducted for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published from 2012 to September 2022. The included full manuscripts comprised nine clinical trials and 16 observational studies, whose participants were aged ≥12 years or were children 6-11 years old with at least one Phe508del mutation and/or advanced lung disease (ALD). These studies reported that ELX/TEZ/IVA has a significant positive effect on the lung function of patients with CF, by ameliorating parameters such as FEV 1 , LCI, pulmonary exacerbations or sweat chloride concentration, increasing BMI and improving quality of their life. Its role in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is not yet clear. It was found that this new CFTR modulator has an overall favorable safety profile, with mild to moderate adverse events. Further studies are needed for a deeper understanding of the impact of CFTR modulators on other CF manifestations, or the possibility of treating with ELX/TEZ/IVA CF patients with rare CFTR mutations.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39756424\">Title: Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor versus elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older (SKYLINE Trials VX20-121-102 and VX20-121-103): results from two randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 trials.\nAuthors: Keating, Claire, Yonker, Lael M, Vermeulen, François et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The Lancet. Respiratory medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe goal of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators is to reach normal CFTR function in people with cystic fibrosis. Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor restored CFTR function in vitro and in phase 2 trials in participants aged 18 years and older resulting in improvements in CFTR function, as measured by sweat chloride concentrations and lung function as measured by spirometry. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor compared with standard of care elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older.\nMETHODS\nIn two randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trials, individuals aged 12 years and older with stable cystic fibrosis with F508del-minimal function (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-102) or with F508del-F508del, F508del-residual function, F508del-gating, or elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-responsive-non-F508del genotypes (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-103) were enrolled at 126 and 159 international sites, respectively. Eligible individuals were entered into a 4-week run-in period, during which they received elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening. They were then randomly assigned (1:1) to either elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening, or vanzacaftor (20 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and deutivacaftor (250 mg once daily) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning, for the 52-week treatment period. All participants received matching placebo tablets to maintain the treatment blinding. Randomisation was done using an interactive web-response system and stratified by age, FEV 1 % predicted, sweat chloride concentration, and previous CFTR modulator use, and also by genotype for Trial VX20-121-103. The primary endpoint for both trials was absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline (most recent value before treatment on day 1) through week 24 (with non-inferiority of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor shown if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the primary endpoint was -3·0 or higher). Efficacy was assessed in all participants with the intended CFTR genotype who were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least one dose of study treatment during the treatment period. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug during the treatment period. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05033080 (Trial VX20-121-102) and NCT05076149 (Trial VX20-121-103), and are now complete.\nFINDINGS\nIn Trial VX20-121-102 between Sept 14, 2021, and Oct 18, 2022, 488 individuals were screened, of whom 435 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 398 were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=202) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=196). Median age was 31·0 years (IQR 22·6-38·5), 163 (41%) of 398 participants were female, 235 (59%) were male, and 388 (97%) were White. In Trial VX20-121-103, between Oct 27, 2021, and Oct 26, 2022, 699 individuals were screened, of whom 597 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 573 participants were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=289) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=284). Median age was 33·1 years (IQR 24·5-42·2), 280 (49%) of 573 participants were female, 293 (51%) were male, and 532 (93%) were White. The absolute change in least squares mean FEV 1 % predicted from baseline through week 24 for Trial VX20-121-102 was 0·5 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·3 (0·3) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference of 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·7 to 1·1]; p<0·0001), and for Trial VX20-121-103, was 0·2 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·0 (0·2) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·5 to 0·9]; p<0·0001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with the most common being infective pulmonary exacerbation (133 [28%] of 480 participants in the pooled vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group vs 158 [32%] of 491 in the pooled elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group), cough (108 [23%] vs 101 [21%]), COVID-19 (107 [22%] vs 127 [26%]), and nasopharyngitis (102 [21%] vs 95 [19%]).\nINTERPRETATION\nVanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor is non-inferior to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in terms of FEV 1 % predicted, and is safe and well tolerated. Once daily dosing with vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor reduces treatment burden, potentially improving adherence, compared with the twice daily regimen of the current standard of care. The restoration of CFTR function and the potential variants treated are also considerations that should be compared with currently available CFTR modulators.\nFUNDING\nVertex Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34784492\">Title: Clinical Effectiveness of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in People with Cystic Fibrosis: A Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Nichols, David P, Paynter, Alex C, Heltshe, Sonya L et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: Rationale: The cystic fibrosis (CF) modulator drug, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), proved highly effective in controlled clinical trials for individuals with at least one F508del allele, which occurs in at least 85% of people with CF. Objectives: PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months' clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. Methods: Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms. Measurements and Main Results: Average age was 25.1 years, and 44.1% entered the study using tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor, whereas 6.7% were using ivacaftor, consistent with F508del homozygosity and G551D allele, respectively. At 6 months into ETI therapy, ppFEV 1 improved 9.76 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.76 to 10.76) from baseline, cystic fibrosis questionnaire-revised respiratory domain score improved 20.4 points (95% CI, 18.3 to 22.5), and sweat chloride decreased -41.7 mmol/L (95% CI, -43.8 to -39.6). BMI also significantly increased. Changes were larger in those naive to modulators but substantial in all groups, including those treated with ivacaftor at baseline. Conclusions: ETI by clinical prescription provided large improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and BMI in a diverse population naive to modulator drug therapy, using existing two-drug combinations, or using ivacaftor alone. Each group also experienced significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, which correlated with improved ppFEV 1 in the overall study population.

Improvements in health outcomes have been achieved with the combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation. The addition of elexacaftor (VX-445), a next-generation CFTR corrector, to tezacaftor plus ivacaftor further improved F508del-CFTR function and clinical outcomes in a phase 2 study in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.\nMETHODS\nThis phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial of elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor was done at 44 sites in four countries. Eligible participants were those with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation, aged 12 years or older with stable disease, and with a percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV 1 ) of 40-90%, inclusive. After a 4-week tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 weeks of elexacaftor 200 mg orally once daily plus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h versus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h alone. The primary outcome was the absolute change from baseline (measured at the end of the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in) in ppFEV 1 at week 4.

CFTR modulators, which were developed in the past decade, partially restore CFTR protein function. Their clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials, particularly in terms of lung function and pulmonary exacerbations, nutritional status, and quality of life in people with gating mutations (ivacaftor), homozygous for the F508del mutation (lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor), and in those with at least one F508del mutation (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). However, many questions remain regarding their long-term safety and effectiveness, particularly in patients with advanced lung disease, liver disease, renal insufficiency, or problematic bacterial colonization. The impact of CFTR modulators on other important outcomes such as concurrent treatments, lung transplantation, chest imaging, or pregnancies also warrants further investigation. The French CF Reference Network includes 47 CF centers that contribute patient data to the comprehensive French CF Registry and have conducted nationwide real-world studies on CFTR modulators. This review seeks to summarize the results of these real-world studies and examine their findings against those of randomized control trials.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36535667\">Title: CFTR Modulators: Current Status and Evolving Knowledge.\nAuthors: Regard, Lucile, Martin, Clémence, Da Silva, Jennifer et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: In the past decade, the medical management of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) has changed with the development of small molecules that partially restore the function of the defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and are called CFTR modulators. Ivacaftor (IVA), a CFTR potentiator with a large effect on epithelial ion transport, was the first modulator approved in pwCF carrying gating mutations. Because IVA was unable to restore sufficient CFTR function in pwCF with other mutations, two CFTR correctors (lumacaftor and tezacaftor) were developed and used in combination with IVA in pwCF homozygous for F508del, the most common CFTR variant. However, LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA were only moderately effective in F508del homozygous pwCF and had no efficacy in those with F508del and minimal function mutations. Elexacaftor, a second-generation corrector, was thus developed and combined to tezacaftor and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) to target pwCF with at least one F508del variant, corresponding to approximately 85% of pwCF. Both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA are considered highly effective modulator therapies (HEMTs) in eligible pwCF and are now approved for nearly 90% of the CF population over 6 years of age. HEMTs are responsible for rapid improvement in respiratory manifestations, including improvement in symptoms and lung function, and reduction in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations. The impact of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations of CF is less well established, although significant weight gain and improvement in quality of life have been demonstrated. Recent clinical trials and real-world studies suggest that benefits of HEMT could even prove greater when used earlier in life (i.e., in younger children and infants). This article shortly reviews the past 10 years of development and use of CFTR modulators. Effects of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations and on CF demographics are also discussed.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30334692\">Title: VX-445-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis and One or Two Phe508del Alleles.\nAuthors: Keating, Dominic, Marigowda, Gautham, Burr, Lucy et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nVX-445 is a next-generation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector designed to restore Phe508del CFTR protein function in patients with cystic fibrosis when administered with tezacaftor and ivacaftor (VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor).\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated the effects of VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor on Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells. On the basis of in vitro activity, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate oral VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del-MF) and in patients homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation (Phe508del-Phe508del) after tezacaftor-ivacaftor run-in. Primary end points were safety and absolute change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) from baseline.\nRESULTS\nIn vitro, VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor significantly improved Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride transport to a greater extent than any two of these agents in dual combination. In patients with cystic fibrosis, VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor had an acceptable safety and side-effect profile. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. The treatment also resulted in an increased percentage of predicted FEV 1 of up to 13.8 points in the Phe508del-MF group (P<0.001). In patients in the Phe508del-Phe508del group, who were already receiving tezacaftor-ivacaftor, the addition of VX-445 resulted in an 11.0-point increase in the percentage of predicted FEV 1 (P<0.001). In both groups, there was a decrease in sweat chloride concentrations and improvement in the respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of VX-445-tezacaftor-ivacaftor to target Phe508del CFTR protein resulted in increased CFTR function in vitro and translated to improvements in patients with cystic fibrosis with one or two Phe508del alleles. This approach has the potential to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in approximately 90% of patients.

In a phase 2 trial involving patients who were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del-minimal function genotype), the next-generation CFTR corrector elexacaftor, in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, improved Phe508del CFTR function and clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in patients 12 years of age or older with cystic fibrosis with Phe508del-minimal function genotypes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was absolute change from baseline in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) at week 4.\nRESULTS\nA total of 403 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of active treatment or placebo. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, relative to placebo, resulted in a percentage of predicted FEV 1 that was 13.8 points higher at 4 weeks and 14.3 points higher through 24 weeks, a rate of pulmonary exacerbations that was 63% lower, a respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a higher patient-reported quality of life with regard to respiratory symptoms; minimum clinically important difference, 4 points) that was 20.2 points higher, and a sweat chloride concentration that was 41.8 mmol per liter lower (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was generally safe and had an acceptable side-effect profile. Most patients had adverse events that were mild or moderate. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen occurred in 1% of the patients in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nElexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was efficacious in patients with cystic fibrosis with Phe508del-minimal function genotypes, in whom previous CFTR modulator regimens were ineffective.

Improvements in health outcomes have been achieved with the combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation. The addition of elexacaftor (VX-445), a next-generation CFTR corrector, to tezacaftor plus ivacaftor further improved F508del-CFTR function and clinical outcomes in a phase 2 study in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.\nMETHODS\nThis phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial of elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor was done at 44 sites in four countries. Eligible participants were those with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation, aged 12 years or older with stable disease, and with a percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV 1 ) of 40-90%, inclusive. After a 4-week tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 weeks of elexacaftor 200 mg orally once daily plus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h versus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h alone. The primary outcome was the absolute change from baseline (measured at the end of the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in) in ppFEV 1 at week 4. Key secondary outcomes were absolute change in sweat chloride and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain (CFQ-R RD) score. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03525548.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Aug 3 and Dec 28, 2018, 113 participants were enrolled. Following the run-in, 107 participants were randomly assigned (55 in the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group and 52 in the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group) and completed the 4-week treatment period. The elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group had improvements in the primary outcome of ppFEV 1 (least squares mean [LSM] treatment difference of 10·0 percentage points [95% CI 7·4 to 12·6], p<0·0001) and the key secondary outcomes of sweat chloride concentration (LSM treatment difference -45·1 mmol/L [95% CI -50·1 to -40·1], p<0·0001), and CFQ-R RD score (LSM treatment difference 17·4 points [95% CI 11·8 to 23·0], p<0·0001) compared with the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group. The triple combination regimen was well tolerated, with no discontinuations. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; serious adverse events occurred in two (4%) participants receiving elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor and in one (2%) receiving tezacaftor plus ivacaftor.\nINTERPRETATION\nElexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinically robust benefit compared with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor alone, with a favourable safety profile, and shows the potential to lead to transformative improvements in the lives of people with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del mutation.\nFUNDING\nVertex Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36980112\">Title: Efficacy and Safety of Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor in the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis: A Systematic Review.\nAuthors: Kapouni, Nikoletta, Moustaki, Maria, Douros, Konstantinos et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Children (Basel, Switzerland)\nAbstract: Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) is a new CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) modulator treatment, used over the last few years, which has shown an improvement in different clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The objective of this study was a systematic research of the literature on the efficacy and safety of this CFTR modulator on patients with CF. A search of Pubmed was conducted for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published from 2012 to September 2022. The included full manuscripts comprised nine clinical trials and 16 observational studies, whose participants were aged ≥12 years or were children 6-11 years old with at least one Phe508del mutation and/or advanced lung disease (ALD). These studies reported that ELX/TEZ/IVA has a significant positive effect on the lung function of patients with CF, by ameliorating parameters such as FEV 1 , LCI, pulmonary exacerbations or sweat chloride concentration, increasing BMI and improving quality of their life. Its role in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is not yet clear. It was found that this new CFTR modulator has an overall favorable safety profile, with mild to moderate adverse events. Further studies are needed for a deeper understanding of the impact of CFTR modulators on other CF manifestations, or the possibility of treating with ELX/TEZ/IVA CF patients with rare CFTR mutations.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39756424\">Title: Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor versus elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older (SKYLINE Trials VX20-121-102 and VX20-121-103): results from two randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 trials.\nAuthors: Keating, Claire, Yonker, Lael M, Vermeulen, François et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The Lancet. Respiratory medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe goal of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators is to reach normal CFTR function in people with cystic fibrosis. Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor restored CFTR function in vitro and in phase 2 trials in participants aged 18 years and older resulting in improvements in CFTR function, as measured by sweat chloride concentrations and lung function as measured by spirometry. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor compared with standard of care elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older.\nMETHODS\nIn two randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trials, individuals aged 12 years and older with stable cystic fibrosis with F508del-minimal function (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-102) or with F508del-F508del, F508del-residual function, F508del-gating, or elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-responsive-non-F508del genotypes (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-103) were enrolled at 126 and 159 international sites, respectively. Eligible individuals were entered into a 4-week run-in period, during which they received elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening. They were then randomly assigned (1:1) to either elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening, or vanzacaftor (20 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and deutivacaftor (250 mg once daily) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning, for the 52-week treatment period. All participants received matching placebo tablets to maintain the treatment blinding. Randomisation was done using an interactive web-response system and stratified by age, FEV 1 % predicted, sweat chloride concentration, and previous CFTR modulator use, and also by genotype for Trial VX20-121-103. The primary endpoint for both trials was absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline (most recent value before treatment on day 1) through week 24 (with non-inferiority of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor shown if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the primary endpoint was -3·0 or higher). Efficacy was assessed in all participants with the intended CFTR genotype who were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least one dose of study treatment during the treatment period. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug during the treatment period. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05033080 (Trial VX20-121-102) and NCT05076149 (Trial VX20-121-103), and are now complete.\nFINDINGS\nIn Trial VX20-121-102 between Sept 14, 2021, and Oct 18, 2022, 488 individuals were screened, of whom 435 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 398 were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=202) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=196). Median age was 31·0 years (IQR 22·6-38·5), 163 (41%) of 398 participants were female, 235 (59%) were male, and 388 (97%) were White. In Trial VX20-121-103, between Oct 27, 2021, and Oct 26, 2022, 699 individuals were screened, of whom 597 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 573 participants were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=289) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=284). Median age was 33·1 years (IQR 24·5-42·2), 280 (49%) of 573 participants were female, 293 (51%) were male, and 532 (93%) were White. The absolute change in least squares mean FEV 1 % predicted from baseline through week 24 for Trial VX20-121-102 was 0·5 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·3 (0·3) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference of 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·7 to 1·1]; p<0·0001), and for Trial VX20-121-103, was 0·2 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·0 (0·2) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·5 to 0·9]; p<0·0001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with the most common being infective pulmonary exacerbation (133 [28%] of 480 participants in the pooled vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group vs 158 [32%] of 491 in the pooled elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group), cough (108 [23%] vs 101 [21%]), COVID-19 (107 [22%] vs 127 [26%]), and nasopharyngitis (102 [21%] vs 95 [19%]).\nINTERPRETATION\nVanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor is non-inferior to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in terms of FEV 1 % predicted, and is safe and well tolerated. Once daily dosing with vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor reduces treatment burden, potentially improving adherence, compared with the twice daily regimen of the current standard of care. The restoration of CFTR function and the potential variants treated are also considerations that should be compared with currently available CFTR modulators.\nFUNDING\nVertex Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31784874\">Title: Elexacaftor/Ivacaftor/Tezacaftor: First Approval.\nAuthors: Hoy, Sheridan M | Year: 2019 | Journal: Drugs\nAbstract: A fixed-dose combination tablet of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector tezacaftor and the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor with the next-generation CFTR corrector elexacaftor (hereafter referred to as elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor) [Trikafta™] has been developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. to treat patients with the most common cystic fibrosis mutation (F508del). Its use has been associated with statistically significant and/or clinically meaningful improvements in lung function and respiratory-related quality of life compared with comparator regimens (placebo or ivacaftor/tezacaftor) in multinational phase II and III studies, and in October 2019 elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients aged ≥ 12 years who have ≥ 1 F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.

In clinical trials, treated patients showed improved pulmonary function, reduced pulmonary exacerbations, and other benefits. This article reviews safety of this therapy. Areas covered: Safety findings in ivacaftor, lumacaftor and combined therapy trials, and reported subsequently through post-approval evaluation, were accessed by PubMed and Google searches using key words 'VX-770', 'ivacaftor', 'VX-809', and 'lumacaftor'. Transaminitis was seen in ivacaftor and combination trials. Non-congenital cataracts were seen in pre-clinical animal studies and in children taking ivacaftor and combined therapy. Dyspnea occurs in some patients taking lumacaftor and combined therapy and usually resolves without stopping treatment. Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A while ivacaftor is a CYP3A sensitive substrate. Combination therapy can decrease systemic exposure of medications that are substrates of CYP3A, decreasing therapeutic effect. Co-administration of lumacaftor-ivacaftor with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic index is not recommended. Expert opinion: Lumacaftor-ivacaftor therapy may be associated with ocular and hepatic side effects. Specific recommendations for monitoring are available. Dyspnea occurs, especially during initiation of treatment. Potential drug interactions should be evaluated in patients taking combination therapy. The risk benefit ratio of lumacaftor-ivacaftor favors therapy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27394157\">Title: Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor: A Review in Cystic Fibrosis.\nAuthors: Deeks, Emma D | Year: 2016 | Journal: Drugs\nAbstract: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi™) is a fixed-dose tablet containing a corrector (lumacaftor) and potentiator (ivacaftor) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is the first therapy approved to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in patients (aged ≥12 years) homozygous for the most common CFTR mutation, F508del. Lumacaftor improves the processing of F508del CFTR and its transport to the cell surface, while ivacaftor increases the channel's open probability and transport of chloride. In two 24-week trials in the approved patient population (TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT), lumacaftor 400 mg plus ivacaftor 250 mg, administered every 12 h in combination with standard therapy, was associated with an ≈3 % statistically significant improvement in lung function relative to placebo (as measured by the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s). Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor did not significantly improve respiratory symptoms, although reduced pulmonary exacerbations to a clinically meaningful extent and, in one trial (TRANSPORT), significantly improved body mass index (BMI). In an ongoing extension of these studies (PROGRESS), lumacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinical benefit over a further 72 weeks of treatment. Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor had an acceptable tolerability profile, with the most common adverse events being respiratory or gastrointestinal in nature. Thus, lumacaftor/ivacaftor expands the treatment options available for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, although its precise place in clinical practice remains to be determined.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31631933\">Title: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis.\nAuthors:  | Year: 2019 | Journal: Australian prescriber\nAbstract: </snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40418577\">Title: Ivacaftor-tezacaftor-elexacaftor, tezacaftor-ivacaftor and lumacaftor-ivacaftor for treating cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and economic evaluation.\nAuthors: Edwards, Steven J, Farrar, Benjamin G, Ennis, Kate et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis is a life-limiting genetic condition that affects over 9000 people in England. Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed through newborn screening and causes symptoms throughout the body, including the lungs and digestive system. Around 90% of individuals with cystic fibrosis have at least one copy of the F508del mutation on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo appraise the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor, tezacaftor-ivacaftor and lumacaftor-ivacaftor within their expected marketing authorisations for treating people with cystic fibrosis and at least one F508del mutation, compared with each other and with established clinical management before these treatments.\nMETHODS\nA de novo systematic literature review (search date February 2023) was conducted searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), bibliographies of relevant systematic literature reviews, clinical trial registers, recent conferences and evidence provided by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Boston, MA, USA). Data on the following outcomes were summarised: acute change in per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (change in weight-for-age z -score; and change in pulmonary exacerbation frequency requiring intravenous antibiotics. Network meta-analyses were conducted where head-to-head data were not available. Data from clinical trials and real-world evidence were examined to assess long-term effectiveness. A patient-level simulation model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three modulator treatments. The model employed a lifetime horizon and was developed from the perspective of the National Health Service.\nRESULTS\nData from 19 primary studies and 7 open-label extension studies were prioritised in the systematic literature review. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with a statistically significant increase in predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and weight-for-age z -score and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations compared with established clinical management, lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and also led to a reduction in the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management, although the magnitude of this decrease was uncertain. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor were also associated with a statistically significant increase in predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations relative to established clinical management, but with a smaller effect size than elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. There was some evidence that tezacaftor/ivacaftor reduced the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management, but little evidence that lumacaftor/ivacaftor reduced the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from the economic analysis were confidential. However, for all genotypes studied the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were above what would be considered cost-effective based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite the improved clinical benefits observed, none of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene modulators assessed would be considered cost-effective based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. This is largely driven by the high acquisition costs of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene modulator treatments.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION\nThis study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42023399583.\nFUNDING\nThis award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR135829) and is published in full in Health Technology Assessment ; Vol. 29, No. 19.

Although loss-of-function mutations involving the tumor suppressor gene, __STK11_ (LKB1)_ are important in lung cancer progression, __STK11__ is not the direct target for anticancer agents. We attempted to identify cancer transcriptome signatures associated with _STK11_ loss-offunction mutations. Several new sensitive and specific gene expression markers (_ENO3, TTC39C, LGALS3, and MAML2_) were identified using two orthogonal measures, i.e., fold change and odds ratio analyses of transcriptome data from cell lines and tissue samples. Among the markers identified, the ENO3 gene over-expression was found to be the direct consequence of _STK11_ loss-of-function. Furthermore, the knockdown of ENO3 expression exhibited selective anticancer effect in _STK11_ mutant cells compared with _STK11_ wild type (or recovered) cells. These findings suggest that ENO3 -based targeted therapy might be promising for patients with lung cancer harboring _STK11_ mutations. \n**Keywords:** Enolase 3; STK11 loss-offunction mutation; lung adenocarcinoma. \n##  MeSH terms \n  * A549 Cells \n  * AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases \n  * Adenocarcinoma / genetics* \n  * Adenocarcinoma / pathology \n  * Biomarkers, Tumor / genetics \n  * Cell Line, Tumor \n  * Cell Proliferation / genetics \n  * Cell Survival / genetics \n  * Gain of Function Mutation* \n  * Gene Expression Profiling / methods* \n  * Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic* \n  * Humans \n  * Lung Neoplasms / genetics* \n  * Lung Neoplasms / pathology \n  * Phosphopyruvate Hydratase / genetics* \n  * Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases / genetics* \n  * RNA Interference \n\n\n##  Substances \n  * Biomarkers, Tumor \n  * Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases \n  * STK11 protein, human \n  * AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases \n  * Phosphopyruvate Hydratase \n\n\n", "fit_markdown": "", "html": null, "error": null}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:30:26.868805"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor 31697874", "result": {"total": 888, "data": [{"paperId": "31697873", "title": "Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor for Cystic Fibrosis with a Single Phe508del Allele.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, and nearly 90% of patients have at least one copy of the Phe508del CFTR mutation.

Objectives: PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months' clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. Methods: Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms. Measurements and Main Results: Average age was 25.1 years, and 44.1% entered the study using tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor, whereas 6.7% were using ivacaftor, consistent with F508del homozygosity and G551D allele, respectively.

Data on the following outcomes were summarised: acute change in per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (change in weight-for-age z -score; and change in pulmonary exacerbation frequency requiring intravenous antibiotics. Network meta-analyses were conducted where head-to-head data were not available. Data from clinical trials and real-world evidence were examined to assess long-term effectiveness. A patient-level simulation model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three modulator treatments. The model employed a lifetime horizon and was developed from the perspective of the National Health Service.\nRESULTS\nData from 19 primary studies and 7 open-label extension studies were prioritised in the systematic literature review. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was associated with a statistically significant increase in predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and weight-for-age z -score and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations compared with established clinical management, lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and also led to a reduction in the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management, although the magnitude of this decrease was uncertain.

There was some evidence that tezacaftor/ivacaftor reduced the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management, but little evidence that lumacaftor/ivacaftor reduced the rate of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline relative to established clinical management.

The signaling mechanisms that control CMA are not fully understood but might involve response to stress conditions including oxidative stress. Considering the role of CMA in redoxtasis and proteostasis, we sought to determine if the transcription factor NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2) has an impact on CMA modulation. In this work, we identified and validated 2 NFE2L2 binding sequences in the LAMP2 gene and demonstrated in several human and mouse cell types that NFE2L2 deficiency and overexpression was linked to reduced and increased LAMP2A levels, respectively. Accordingly, lysosomal LAMP2A levels were drastically reduced in nfe2l2-knockout hepatocytes, which also displayed a marked decrease in CMA activity. Oxidant challenge with paraquat or hydrogen peroxide, or pharmacological activation of NFE2L2 with sulforaphane or dimethyl fumarate also increased LAMP2A levels and CMA activity. Overall, our study identifies for the first time basal and inducible regulation of LAMP2A, and consequently CMA activity, by NFE2L2.\nABBREVIATIONS\nACTB: actin, beta, ARE: antioxidant response element; ATG5: autophagy related 5; BACH1: BTB domain and CNC homolog 1; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; DHE: dihydroethidium; DMF: dimethyl fumarate; ENCODE: Encyclopedia of DNA elements at the University of California, Santa Cruz; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GBA: glucosylceramidase beta; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HMOX1: heme oxygenase 1; H 2 O 2 : hydrogen peroxide; HSPA8/HSC70: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8; KEAP1: kelch like ECH associated protein 1; LAMP2A: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A; LAMP2B: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2B; LAMP2C: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2C; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; MAFF: MAF bZIP transcription factor F; MAFK: MAF bZIP transcription factor K; NFE2L2/NRF2: nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2; NQO1: NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1; PQ: paraquat; PI: protease inhibitors; qRT-PCR: quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; RNASE: ribonuclease A family member; SFN: sulforaphane; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; TBP: TATA-box binding protein.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38176266\">Title: Mangiferin attenuates osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoblastic ferroptosis through Keap1/Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway.\nAuthors: Deng, Xuehui, Lin, Bingfeng, Wang, Fang et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nFerroptosis is a crucial contributor to impaired osteoblast function in osteoporosis. Mangiferin, a xanthonoid glucoside isolated from mangoes, exhibits anti-osteoporosis effects. However, its potential mechanism is not fully understood.\nPURPOSE\nThis study explores the potencies of mangiferin on osteoblastic ferroptosis and deciphers its direct target in the context of solute carrier family 7-member 11 (SLC7A11)/glutathione peroxidases 4 (GPX4) pathway.\nMETHODS\nIn vivo models include bilateral ovariectomy induced osteoporosis mice, iron-dextran induced iron-overloaded mice, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-knockout mice. Mice are orally administrated mangiferin (10, 50 or 100 mg.kg -1 . d -1 ) for 12 weeks. In vitro osteoblast models include iron-dextran induced iron-overloaded cells, erastin induced ferroptosis cells, and gene knockout cells. RNA sequencing is applied for investigating the underlying mechanisms. The direct target of mangiferin is studied using a cellular thermal shift assay, silico docking, and surface plasmon resonance.\nRESULTS\nMangiferin promotes bone formation and inhibits ferroptosis in vivo models (osteoporosis mice, iron-overloaded mice) and in vitro models (ferroptosis osteoblast, iron-overloaded osteoblasts). Mechanismly, mangiferin directly binds to the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and activates the downstream Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway in both the in vivo and in vitro models. Mangiferin failed to restore the osteoporosis and ferroptosis in Nrf2-knockout mice. Silencing Nrf2, SLC7A11 or GPX4 abolished the anti-ferroptosis effect of mangiferin in erastin-induced cells. Addition of the ferroptosis agonist RSL-3 also blocked the protective effects of mangiferin on iron-overloaded cells. Furthermore, mangiferin had better effects on osteogenesis than the ferroptosis inhibitor (ferrostatin-1) and the Nrf2 agonists (sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate, and bardoxolone).\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe identify for the first time mangiferin as a ferroptosis inhibitor and a direct Keap1 conjugator that promotes bone formation and alleviates osteoporosis. This work also provides a potentially practical pharmacological approach for treating ferroptosis-driven diseases.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36290650\">Title: Dimethyl Fumarate Triggers the Antioxidant Defense System in Human Retinal Endothelial Cells through Nrf2 Activation.\nAuthors: Manai, Federico, Amadio, Marialaura | Year: 2022 | Journal: Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)\nAbstract: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a well-known activator of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), used in the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. The mechanism of action consists in the modification of the cysteine residues on the Nrf2-inhibitor Keap1, thus leading to the dissociation of these two proteins and the consequent activation of Nrf2. Considering the paucity of evidence of DMF effects in the context of retinal endothelium, this in vitro study investigated the role of DMF in human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Here, we show for the first time in HREC that DMF activates the Nrf2 pathway, thus leading to an increase in HO-1 protein levels and a decrease in intracellular ROS levels. Furthermore, this molecule also shows beneficial properties in a model of hyperglucose stress, exerting cytoprotective prosurvival effects. The overall collected results suggest that DMF-mediated activation of the Nrf2 pathway may also be a promising strategy in ocular diseases characterized by oxidative stress. This study opens a new perspective on DMF and suggests its potential repositioning in a broader therapeutical context.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29263788\">Title: Recent advances in understanding NRF2 as a druggable target: development of pro-electrophilic and non-covalent NRF2 activators to overcome systemic side effects of electrophilic drugs like dimethyl fumarate.\nAuthors: Satoh, Takumi, Lipton, Stuart | Year: 2017 | Journal: F1000Research\nAbstract: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an electrophilic compound previously called BG-12 and marketed under the name Tecfidera ® . It was approved in 2013 by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. One mechanism of action of DMF is stimulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcriptional pathway that induces anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory phase II enzymes to prevent chronic neurodegeneration. However, electrophiles such as DMF also produce severe systemic side effects, in part due to non-specific S-alkylation of cysteine thiols and resulting depletion of glutathione. This mini-review presents the present status and future strategy for NRF2 activators designed to avoid these side effects. Two modes of chemical reaction leading to NRF2 activation are considered here. The first mode is S-alkylation (covalent reaction) of thiols in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which interacts with NRF2. The second mechanism involves non-covalent pharmacological inhibition of protein-protein interactions, in particular domain-specific interaction between NRF2 and KEAP1 or other repressor proteins involved in this transcriptional pathway. There have been significant advances in drug development using both of these mechanisms that can potentially avoid the systemic side effects of electrophilic compounds. In the first case concerning covalent reaction with KEAP1, monomethyl fumarate and monoethyl fumarate appear to represent safer derivatives of DMF. In a second approach, pro-electrophilic drugs, such as carnosic acid from the herb Rosmarinus officinalis , can be used as a safe pro-drug of an electrophilic compound. Concerning non-covalent activation of NRF2, drugs are being developed that interfere with the direct interaction of KEAP1-NRF2 or inhibit BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1), which is a transcriptional repressor of the promoter where NRF2 binds.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36552824\">Title: The Challenge of Dimethyl Fumarate Repurposing in Eye Pathologies.\nAuthors: Manai, Federico, Govoni, Stefano, Amadio, Marialaura | Year: 2022 | Journal: Cells\nAbstract: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a small molecule currently approved and used in the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis due to its immuno-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. As an Nrf2 activator through Keap1 protein inhibition, DMF unveils a potential therapeutical use that is much broader than expected so far. In this comprehensive review we discuss the state-of-art and future perspectives regarding the potential repositioning of this molecule in the panorama of eye pathologies, including Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The DMF's mechanism of action, an extensive analysis of the in vitro and in vivo evidence of its beneficial effects, together with a search of the current clinical trials, are here reported. Altogether, this evidence gives an overview of the new potential applications of this molecule in the context of ophthalmological diseases characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress, with a special focus on AMD, for which our gene-disease ( KEAP1 -AMD) database search, followed by a protein-protein interaction analysis, further supports the rationale of DMF use. The necessity to find a topical route of DMF administration to the eye is also discussed. In conclusion, the challenge of DMF repurposing in eye pathologies is feasible and worth scientific attention and well-focused research efforts.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"22732183\">Title: Validation of the multiple sensor mechanism of the Keap1-Nrf2 system.\nAuthors: Takaya, Kai, Suzuki, Takafumi, Motohashi, Hozumi et al. | Year: 2012 | Journal: Free radical biology & medicine\nAbstract: The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a critical role in cellular defense against electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. Keap1 possesses a number of cysteine residues, some of which are highly reactive and serves as sensors for these insults. Indeed, point mutation of Cys151 abrogates the response to certain electrophiles. However, this mutation does not affect the other set of electrophiles, suggesting that multiple sensor systems reside within the cysteine residues of Keap1. The precise contribution of each reactive cysteine to the sensor function of Keap1 remains to be clarified. To elucidate the contribution of Cys151 in vivo, in this study we adopted transgenic complementation rescue assays. Embryonic fibroblasts and primary peritoneal macrophages were prepared from mice expressing the Keap1-C151S mutant. These cells were challenged with various Nrf2 inducers. We found that some of the inducers triggered only marginal responses in Keap1-C151S-expressing cells, while others evoked responses in a comparable magnitude to those observed in the wild-type cells. We found that tert-butyl hydroquinone, diethylmaleate, sulforaphane, and dimethylfumarate were Cys151 preferable, whereas 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PG-J(2)), 2-cyano-3,12 dioxooleana-1,9 diene-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im), ebselen, nitro-oleic acid, and cadmium chloride were Cys151 independent. Experiments with embryonic fibroblasts and primary macrophages yielded consistent results. Experiments testing protective effects against the cytotoxicity of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene of sulforaphane and 15d-PG-J(2) in Keap1-C151S-expressing macrophages revealed that the former inducer was effective, while the latter was not. These results thus indicate that there exists distinct utilization of Keap1 cysteine residues by different chemicals that trigger the response of the Keap1-Nrf2 system, and further substantiate the notion that there are multiple sensing mechanisms within Keap1 cysteine residues.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32053878\">Title: Electrophiles Against (Skin) Diseases: More Than Nrf2.\nAuthors: Hennig, Paulina, Fenini, Gabriele, Di Filippo, Michela et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Biomolecules\nAbstract: The skin represents an indispensable barrier between the organism and the environment and is the first line of defense against exogenous insults. The transcription factor NRF2 is a central regulator of cytoprotection and stress resistance. NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles. These electrophiles oxidize specific cysteine residues of the NRF2 inhibitor KEAP1, leading to KEAP1 inactivation and, subsequently, NRF2 activation. As oxidative stress is associated with inflammation, the NRF2 pathway plays important roles in the pathogenesis of common inflammatory diseases and cancer in many tissues and organs, including the skin. The electrophile and NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an established and efficient drug for patients suffering from the common inflammatory skin disease psoriasis and the neuro-inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of DMF and other NRF2 activators. Recent evidence suggests that electrophiles not only activate NRF2, but also target other inflammation-associated pathways including the transcription factor NF-κB and the multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are central regulators of inflammation and are involved in many inflammatory conditions. Most importantly, the NRF2 and inflammasome pathways are connected at different levels, mainly antagonistically.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29913224\">Title: Canonical and non-canonical mechanisms of Nrf2 activation.\nAuthors: Silva-Islas, Carlos Alfredo, Maldonado, Perla D | Year: 2018 | Journal: Pharmacological research\nAbstract: Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the metabolism, immune response, cellular proliferation, and other processes; however, the attention has been focused on the study of its ability to induce the expression of proteins involved in the antioxidant defense. Nrf2 is mainly regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), an adapter substrate of Cullin 3 (Cul3) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Keap1 represses Nrf2 activity in the cytoplasm by its sequestering, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Nrf2 activation, through the canonical mechanism, is carried out by electrophilic compounds and oxidative stress where some cysteine residues in Keap1 are oxidized, resulting in a decrease in Nrf2 ubiquitination and an increase in its nuclear translocation and activation. In the nucleus, Nrf2 induces a variety of genes involved in the antioxidant defense. Recently a new mechanism of Nrf2 activation has been described, called the non-canonical pathway, where proteins such as p62, p21, dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3), wilms tumor gene on X chromosome (WTX) and others are able to disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, by direct interaction with Keap1 decreasing Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its nuclear translocation and activation. In this review, the regulatory mechanisms involved in both canonical and non-canonical Nrf2 activation are discussed.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>I need primary mechanistic studies (cell/animal/human biomarker) directly linking dimethyl fumarate (or its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate) to Keap1 cysteine sensing and downstream Nrf2/ARE gene induction, especially in MS/EAE contexts, to connect mechanism to DEFINE efficacy.

Optic neuritis is an episodic sequela experienced by some patients with RRMS that typically presents as acute, monocular vision loss. Episodes of optic neuritis damage and kill retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and can culminate in permanent vision loss. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the capacity of DMF to mitigate optic neuritis. The work presented combines studies of a mouse model of MS and a retrospective chart analysis of files of patients with RRMS treated at the MS Center of Excellence within the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.\nMETHODS\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-established mouse model that recapitulates cardinal features of somatic and visual MS pathologies. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6J mice by inoculation with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (residues 35-55; MOG 35-55 ). DMF or vehicle was administered twice a day by oral gavage. Visual acuity was measured longitudinally with optokinetic tracking. Post-mortem analyses included quantification of RGCs in retinal flatmounts and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of Nrf2 target genes and regulators of myelin. Retrospective chart analyses were performed using data obtained from deidentified files of patients with RRMS.\nRESULTS\nIn the EAE mouse studies, DMF decreased optic neuritis severity, preserved vision and RGCs, and concomitantly reduced motor deficits when administered by two different treatment regimens (prevention or interventional). DMF was more efficacious when administered as an interventional therapy, and the beneficial effects occurred independently of the induction of Nrf2 target genes. A complementary retrospective chart analysis demonstrated that DMF increased the time to a recurrence of optic neuritis, and protected against subsequent bouts of optic neuritis.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis work underscores the potential of DMF to mitigate the severity and recurrence of optic neuritis episodes in patients with RRMS.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27078105\">Title: Dimethyl fumarate treatment induces adaptive and innate immune modulation independent of Nrf2.\nAuthors: Schulze-Topphoff, Ulf, Varrin-Doyer, Michel, Pekarek, Kara et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\nAbstract: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) (BG-12, Tecfidera) is a fumaric acid ester (FAE) that was advanced as a multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy largely for potential neuroprotection as it was recognized that FAEs are capable of activating the antioxidative transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. However, DMF treatment in randomized controlled MS trials was associated with marked reductions in relapse rate and development of active brain MRI lesions, measures considered to reflect CNS inflammation. Here, we investigated the antiinflammatory contribution of Nrf2 in DMF treatment of the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2(-/-)) mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55 (p35-55) for EAE induction and treated with oral DMF or vehicle daily. DMF protected WT and Nrf2(-/-) mice equally well from development of clinical and histologic EAE. The beneficial effect of DMF treatment in Nrf2(-/-) and WT mice was accompanied by reduced frequencies of IFN-γ and IL-17-producing CD4(+) cells and induction of antiinflammatory M2 (type II) monocytes. DMF also modulated B-cell MHC II expression and reduced the incidence of clinical disease in a B-cell-dependent model of spontaneous CNS autoimmunity. Our observations that oral DMF treatment promoted immune modulation and provided equal clinical benefit in acute EAE in Nrf2(-/-) and WT mice, suggest that the antiinflammatory activity of DMF in treatment of MS patients may occur through alternative pathways, independent of Nrf2.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29363907\">Title: Effect of dimethyl fumarate on heme oxygenase-1 expression in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rats.\nAuthors: Kasarełło, Kaja, Jesion, Anika, Tyszkowska, Karolina et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: Folia neuropathologica\nAbstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmunological disease leading to neurodegeneration. The etiology of the disease remains unknown, which strongly impedes the development of effective therapy. Most MS treatments focus on modulating the activity of the immune system. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) exerts a broad spectrum of action, such as modulating immune cell differentiation towards anti-inflammatory subtypes, influencing cytokine production, regulating immune cell migration into the central nervous system, and activating intracellular antioxidant mechanisms. It is well established that activation of the nuclear factor E2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway, leading to expression of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, is influenced by DMF. In our experiments we used female Lewis rats in an animal model of MS - experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The rats were fed with dimethyl fumarate to test the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), one of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, at specific time points of the symptomatic phases of the disease: on the first day of the occurrence of clinical symptoms (10th day post immunization, DPI); at the peak of clinical symptoms (14th DPI); and at the end of the relapse (21st DPI). The results showed that HO-1 expression, at both the mRNA and protein level, is influenced by DMF administration only at the very beginning of the symptomatic phase of EAE, and not at the peak of clinical symptoms, nor at the end of the relapse. This indicates that the regulation of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by DMF occurs at a certain time interval (early EAE/MS) and strongly underlines the importance of the earliest introduction of the therapy to the patient. .</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36052340\">Title: Gliosis attenuation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by a combination of dimethyl fumarate and pregabalin.\nAuthors: Hoelz, Amanda Garcia, Bernardes, Danielle, Cartarozzi, Luciana Politti et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Frontiers in cellular neuroscience\nAbstract: Dysregulated microglia and astrocytes have been associated with progressive neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS), highlighting the need for strategies that additionally target intrinsic inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). The objective of the present study was to investigate the glial response in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice treated with a combination of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and pregabalin (PGB). For that, 28 C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the five experimental groups: naïve, EAE, EAE-DMF, EAE-PGB, and EAE-DMF + PGB. Pharmacological treatments were initiated with the beginning of clinical signs, and all animals were euthanized at 28 dpi for the lumbar spinal cord evaluation. The results demonstrated a stronger attenuation of the clinical presentation by the combined approach. DMF alone promoted the downregulation of Iba-1 (microglia/macrophages marker) in the ventral horn compared with the non-treated EAE animals ( P < 0.05). PGB treatment was associated with reduced Iba-1 immunofluorescence in both the dorsal ( P < 0.05) and ventral horn ( P < 0.05) compared to EAE vehicle-treated counterparts. However, the combined approach reduced the Iba-1 marker in the dorsal ( P < 0.05) and ventral ( P < 0.01) horns compared to non-treated EAE animals and further reduced Iba-1 in the ventral horn compared to each drug-alone approach ( P < 0.05). In addition, the combination of DMF and PGB reduced activated astrocytes (GFAP) in both the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord to a naïve-like level and upregulated Nrf-2 expression. Taken together, the data herein suggest robust attenuation of the glial response in EAE mice treated with DMF and PGB.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28246026\">Title: The novel Nrf2 inducer TFM-735 ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.\nAuthors: Higashi, Chika, Kawaji, Atsuko, Tsuda, Naoto et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: European journal of pharmacology\nAbstract: The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized by progressive demyelination and neurodegeneration induced by inflammation and oxidative stress. The induction of Nrf2 signaling has been shown to inhibit disease development and progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS in mice. In the present study, we performed a high-throughput screening assay using a chimeric construct of the N-terminal portion of Nrf2 fused to LacZ. Using this approach, we identified the novel Nrf2 inducer TFM-735. Using human primary cell profiling systems, we found that TFM-735 inhibited T cell proliferation and exerted immuno-modulatory effects by inhibiting the production of IL-6 and IL-17. TFM-735 also inhibited IL-17 secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. In EAE mice treated with TFM-735, the expression of the Nrf2 target gene Nqo1 increased in the brain and spleen, disease severity was ameliorated, and plasma IL-17 levels decreased. Furthermore, TFM-735 inhibited luciferase activity in Wim-6 transgenic EAE mice expressing the human interleukin 6-luciferase (hIL6-BAC-Luc) reporter. Therefore, these findings indicate that TFM-735 is a potent Nrf2 inducer that inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and disease progression in mice with EAE and that TFM-735 is a promising therapeutic agent for MS.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38116420\">Title: Tuning the Reactivity of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) Activators for Optimal in Vivo Efficacy.\nAuthors: Markovtsov, Vadim, Duncton, Matthew A J, Bagos, Art et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: ACS medicinal chemistry letters\nAbstract: Dimethyl fumarate 1 is approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis but is also associated with off-target activation of the niacin receptor. By using a tetrazolone or triazolone bioisostere approach to the fumarate and vinyl sulfone series of Nrf2 activators, we have optimized the electrophilicity of the double bond to tune the on-target Nrf2 activation with PK properties to achieve efficacy in animal models of multiple sclerosis. The study linked highly potent, highly electrophilic molecules to low plasma stability and, subsequently, limited efficacy. By contrast, a sulfonylvinyltriazolone 17 retains on-target potency but shows much weaker electrophilic potential. As a consequence, in vivo high exposures of 17 are obtained, resulting in efficacy in the EAE model similar to that observed for DMF. 17 (R079) is Ames negative, is not cytotoxic to cells, and shows little inhibition of either the niacin receptor or a panel of off-target receptors.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"23109883\">Title: Mechanisms of oxidative damage in multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases: therapeutic modulation via fumaric acid esters.\nAuthors: Lee, De-Hyung, Gold, Ralf, Linker, Ralf A | Year: 2012 | Journal: International journal of molecular sciences\nAbstract: Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in many neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's as well as Huntington's disease. Inflammation and oxidative stress are also thought to promote tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent data point at an important role of anti-oxidative pathways for tissue protection in chronic-progressive MS, particularly involving the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Thus, novel therapeutics enhancing cellular resistance to free radicals could prove useful for MS treatment. Here, fumaric acid esters (FAE) are a new, orally available treatment option which had already been tested in phase II/III MS trials demonstrating beneficial effects on relapse rates and magnetic resonance imaging markers. In vitro, application of dimethylfumarate (DMF) leads to stabilization of Nrf2, activation of Nrf2-dependent transcriptional activity and abundant synthesis of detoxifying proteins. Furthermore, application of FAE involves direct modification of the inhibitor of Nrf2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1. On cellular levels, the application of FAE enhances neuronal survival and protects astrocytes against oxidative stress. Increased levels of Nrf2 are detected in the central nervous system of DMF treated mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. In EAE, DMF ameliorates the disease course and improves preservation of myelin, axons and neurons. Finally, Nrf2 is also up-regulated in the spinal cord of autopsy specimens from untreated patients with MS, probably as part of a naturally occurring anti-oxidative response. In summary, oxidative stress and anti-oxidative pathways are important players in MS pathophysiology and constitute a promising target for future MS therapies like FAE.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24076006\">Title: Effects of fumaric acid esters on blood-brain barrier tight junction proteins.\nAuthors: Bénardais, Karelle, Pul, Refik, Singh, Vikramjeet et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Neuroscience letters\nAbstract: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of a network of tight junctions (TJ) which interconnect cerebral endothelial cells (EC). Alterations in the TJ proteins are common in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis (MS). Modulation of the BBB could thus represent a therapeutic mechanism. One pathway to modulate BBB integrity could be the induction of nuclear-factor (erythroid derived 2) related factor-2 (Nrf2) mediated oxidative stress responses which are targeted by fumaric acid esters (FAE). Here we analyze effects of FAE on the expression of TJ proteins in the human cerebral endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that dimethylfumarate (DMF) and its primary metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) induce the expression of the Nrf2/NQO1 pathway in endothelial cells. Neither MMF nor DMF had a consistent modulatory effect on the expression of TJ molecules in hCMEC/D3 cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNFα)-induced downregulation of TJ proteins was at least partially reversed by treatment with FAE. However, DMF had no effect on claudin-5 expression in EAE, despite its effect on the clinical score and infiltration of immune cells. These data suggest that the modulation of the BBB is not a major mechanism of action of FAE in inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"10\">BG-12 fumarate Nrf2 astrocytes</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 2 results.

DMF modifies glutathione (GSH) levels that can induce expression of the anti-inflammatory protein HO-1 (haem oxygenase-1). In primary astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, BG-12 dose-dependently suppressed nitrite production induced by either LI [LPS (lipopolysaccharide) at 1 μg/ml plus IFNγ (interferon γ) at 20 units/ml] or a mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with greater efficacy in C6 cells. BG-12 reduced NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2) mRNA levels and activation of a NOS2 promoter, reduced nuclear levels of NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) p65 subunit and attenuated loss of IκBα (inhibitory κBα) in both cell types, although with greater effects in astrocytes. In astrocytes, LI decreased mRNA levels for GSHr (GSH reductase) and GCL (c-glutamylcysteine synthetase), and slightly suppressed GSHs (GSH synthetase) mRNAs. Co-treatment with BG-12 prevented those decreased and increased levels above control values. In contrast, LI reduced GSHp (GSH peroxidase) and GCL in C6 cells, and BG-12 had no effect on those levels. BG-12 increased nuclear levels of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2), an inducer of GSH-related enzymes, in astrocytes but not C6 cells. In astrocytes, GSH was decreased by BG-12 at 2 h and increased at 24 h. Prior depletion of GSH using buthionine-sulfoximine increased the ability of BG-12 to reduce nitrites. In astrocytes, BG-12 increased HO-1 mRNA levels and effects on nitrite levels were blocked by an HO-1 inhibitor. These results demonstrate that BG-12 suppresses inflammatory activation in astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, but with distinct mechanisms, different dependence on GSH and different effects on transcription factor activation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"22267202\">Title: Fumarates promote cytoprotection of central nervous system cells against oxidative stress via the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 pathway.\nAuthors: Scannevin, Robert H, Chollate, Sowmya, Jung, Mi-young et al. | Year: 2012 | Journal: The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics\nAbstract: Oxidative stress is central to the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, and therapeutics designed to enhance antioxidant potential could have clinical value. The objective of this study was to characterize the potential direct neuroprotective effects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its primary metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) on cellular resistance to oxidative damage in primary cultures of central nervous system (CNS) cells and further explore the dependence and function of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway in this process. Treatment of animals or primary cultures of CNS cells with DMF or MMF resulted in increased nuclear levels of active Nrf2, with subsequent up-regulation of canonical antioxidant target genes. DMF-dependent up-regulation of antioxidant genes in vivo was lost in mice lacking Nrf2 [Nrf2(-/-)]. DMF or MMF treatment increased cellular redox potential, glutathione, ATP levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration-dependent manner. Treating astrocytes or neurons with DMF or MMF also significantly improved cell viability after toxic oxidative challenge in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect on viability was lost in cells that had eliminated or reduced Nrf2. These data suggest that DMF and MMF are cytoprotective for neurons and astrocytes against oxidative stress-induced cellular injury and loss, potentially via up-regulation of an Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response. These data also suggest DMF and MMF may function through improving mitochondrial function. The clinical utility of DMF in multiple sclerosis is being explored through phase III trials with BG-12, which is an oral therapeutic containing DMF as the active ingredient.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"6\">DEFINE trial BG-12 placebo</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 6 results.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral BG-12 at a dose of 240 mg twice daily, BG-12 at a dose of 240 mg three times daily, or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who had a relapse by 2 years. Other end points included the annualized relapse rate, the time to confirmed progression of disability, and findings on MRI.\nRESULTS\nThe estimated proportion of patients who had a relapse was significantly lower in the two BG-12 groups than in the placebo group (27% with BG-12 twice daily and 26% with BG-12 thrice daily vs. 46% with placebo, P<0.001 for both comparisons). The annualized relapse rate at 2 years was 0.17 in the twice-daily BG-12 group and 0.19 in the thrice-daily BG-12 group, as compared with 0.36 in the placebo group, representing relative reductions of 53% and 48% with the two BG-12 regimens, respectively (P<0.001 for the comparison of each BG-12 regimen with placebo). The estimated proportion of patients with confirmed progression of disability was 16% in the twice-daily BG-12 group, 18% in the thrice-daily BG-12 group, and 27% in the placebo group, with significant relative risk reductions of 38% with BG-12 twice daily (P=0.005) and 34% with BG-12 thrice daily (P=0.01). BG-12 also significantly reduced the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and of new or enlarging T(2)-weighted hyperintense lesions (P<0.001 for the comparison of each BG-12 regimen with placebo). Adverse events associated with BG-12 included flushing and gastrointestinal events, such as diarrhea, nausea, and upper abdominal pain, as well as decreased lymphocyte counts and elevated liver aminotransferase levels.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, both BG-12 regimens, as compared with placebo, significantly reduced the proportion of patients who had a relapse, the annualized relapse rate, the rate of disability progression, and the number of lesions on MRI.

HRQoL was assessed by the Short Form-36 (SF-36), global assessment of well-being visual analog scale and the EuroQol-5D.\nRESULTS\nIn the 1237 patients from DEFINE, HRQoL impairment was greatest in patients who had higher disability scores and in those who had experienced relapse. Change in SF-36 physical component summary scores during 2 years' treatment significantly favored BG-12 over placebo (both doses: p < 0.001). We saw similar benefits in other measures of functioning and general well-being as early as Week 24. These benefits were maintained during the study.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results add to evidence for a negative impact of RRMS on HRQoL and they demonstrate the benefits of BG-12 on HRQoL measures, which coupled with significant clinical efficacy, further support its use as a new treatment for RRMS.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"23797999\">Title: Clinical efficacy of BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: subgroup analyses of the DEFINE study.\nAuthors: Bar-Or, Amit, Gold, Ralf, Kappos, Ludwig et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Journal of neurology\nAbstract: In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 DEFINE study in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, oral BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) significantly reduced the proportion of patients relapsed (primary endpoint), the annualized relapse rate (ARR), and confirmed disability progression (secondary endpoints) at two years compared with placebo. We investigated the efficacy of BG-12 240 mg twice daily (BID) and three times daily (TID) in patient subgroups stratified according to baseline demographic and disease characteristics including gender, age, relapse history, McDonald criteria, treatment history, expanded disability status scale score, T2 lesion volume, and gadolinium-enhancing lesions. The clinical efficacy of BG-12 was generally consistent across patient subgroups and reflected positive findings in the overall DEFINE study population. Treatment with BG-12 BID and TID reduced the proportion of patients relapsed and the ARR at two years compared with placebo in all patient subgroups. Reductions in the risk of relapse with BG-12 BID vs. placebo ranged from 68% [hazard ratio 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.62)] to 26% [0.74 (0.51-1.09)] and from 66% [0.34 (0.23-0.50)] to 25% [0.75 (0.42-1.36)] with BG-12 TID vs. placebo. BG-12 also reduced the risk of disability progression at two years compared with placebo in most subgroups of patients treated with the BID dosing regimen and in all subgroups treated with the TID regimen. These analyses indicate that treatment with BG-12 is consistently effective across a wide spectrum of patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis with varied demographic and disease characteristics.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24150778\">Title: Effects of BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) on health-related quality of life in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: findings from the CONFIRM study.\nAuthors: Kita, Mariko, Fox, Robert J, Phillips, J Theodore et al. | Year: 2014 | Journal: Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)\nAbstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with symptoms adversely affecting many aspects of everyday living. BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) demonstrated significant efficacy in the phase III studies DEFINE and CONFIRM in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. In CONFIRM, HRQoL was worse in patients with greater disability at baseline, and who relapsed during the study, and improved with BG-12 treatment.

The drug was much anticipated because of its possible superiority over currently available medications: fingolimod and teriflunomide as the only MS treatments currently available in oral form.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of BG-12 in the treatment of RRMS.\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature search was conducted in Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up till 3(rd) November, 2013. We sought all published randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of dimethyl fumarate for the treatment of patients with RRMS. All included studies were critically appraised and analyzed with the use of Review Manager 5.1.0. software according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol.\nRESULTS\nTwo trials, DEFINE and CONFIRM involved 2 651 patients and compared dimethyl fumarate taken either two or three times daily with placebo in patients with RRMS. Additionally in CONFIRM trial third group of patients received glatiramer acetate. The overall results of the meta-analysis showed that BG-12 (at both dosages) given to patients with RRMS is safe and statistically significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the proportion of patients who had a relapse by 2 years, the rate of disability progression and the mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at 2 years. The comparison between BG-12 and glatiramer acetate revealed that the analyzed agent could potentially be more effective in the treatment of RRMS.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite limited RCTs data available, both analyzed BG-12 regimens showed their efficacy on clinical disease parameters and other measures of disease activity in RRMS.

Mechanismly, mangiferin directly binds to the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and activates the downstream Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 pathway in both the in vivo and in vitro models. Mangiferin failed to restore the osteoporosis and ferroptosis in Nrf2-knockout mice. Silencing Nrf2, SLC7A11 or GPX4 abolished the anti-ferroptosis effect of mangiferin in erastin-induced cells.

This mini-review presents the present status and future strategy for NRF2 activators designed to avoid these side effects. Two modes of chemical reaction leading to NRF2 activation are considered here. The first mode is S-alkylation (covalent reaction) of thiols in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which interacts with NRF2.

Altogether, this evidence gives an overview of the new potential applications of this molecule in the context of ophthalmological diseases characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress, with a special focus on AMD, for which our gene-disease ( KEAP1 -AMD) database search, followed by a protein-protein interaction analysis, further supports the rationale of DMF use. The necessity to find a topical route of DMF administration to the eye is also discussed. In conclusion, the challenge of DMF repurposing in eye pathologies is feasible and worth scientific attention and well-focused research efforts.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Cells"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:30:42.640609"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 10}, "query": "dimethyl fumarate EAE Nrf2", "result": {"total": 8, "data": [{"paperId": "31523122", "title": "Dimethyl fumarate mitigates optic neuritis.", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nDimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease characterized by acute episodes of motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms. Optic neuritis is an episodic sequela experienced by some patients with RRMS that typically presents as acute, monocular vision loss. Episodes of optic neuritis damage and kill retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and can culminate in permanent vision loss. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the capacity of DMF to mitigate optic neuritis. The work presented combines studies of a mouse model of MS and a retrospective chart analysis of files of patients with RRMS treated at the MS Center of Excellence within the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.\nMETHODS\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-established mouse model that recapitulates cardinal features of somatic and visual MS pathologies. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6J mice by inoculation with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (residues 35-55; MOG 35-55 ). DMF or vehicle was administered twice a day by oral gavage. Visual acuity was measured longitudinally with optokinetic tracking. Post-mortem analyses included quantification of RGCs in retinal flatmounts and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of Nrf2 target genes and regulators of myelin. Retrospective chart analyses were performed using data obtained from deidentified files of patients with RRMS.\nRESULTS\nIn the EAE mouse studies, DMF decreased optic neuritis severity, preserved vision and RGCs, and concomitantly reduced motor deficits when administered by two different treatment regimens (prevention or interventional). DMF was more efficacious when administered as an interventional therapy, and the beneficial effects occurred independently of the induction of Nrf2 target genes. A complementary retrospective chart analysis demonstrated that DMF increased the time to a recurrence of optic neuritis, and protected against subsequent bouts of optic neuritis.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis work underscores the potential of DMF to mitigate the severity and recurrence of optic neuritis episodes in patients with RRMS.", "year": "2019", "venue": "Molecular vision"}, {"paperId": "27078105", "title": "Dimethyl fumarate treatment induces adaptive and innate immune modulation independent of Nrf2.", "abstract": "Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) (BG-12, Tecfidera) is a fumaric acid ester (FAE) that was advanced as a multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy largely for potential neuroprotection as it was recognized that FAEs are capable of activating the antioxidative transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. However, DMF treatment in randomized controlled MS trials was associated with marked reductions in relapse rate and development of active brain MRI lesions, measures considered to reflect CNS inflammation. Here, we investigated the antiinflammatory contribution of Nrf2 in DMF treatment of the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2(-/-)) mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35-55 (p35-55) for EAE induction and treated with oral DMF or vehicle daily. DMF protected WT and Nrf2(-/-) mice equally well from development of clinical and histologic EAE. The beneficial effect of DMF treatment in Nrf2(-/-) and WT mice was accompanied by reduced frequencies of IFN-γ and IL-17-producing CD4(+) cells and induction of antiinflammatory M2 (type II) monocytes. DMF also modulated B-cell MHC II expression and reduced the incidence of clinical disease in a B-cell-dependent model of spontaneous CNS autoimmunity. Our observations that oral DMF treatment promoted immune modulation and provided equal clinical benefit in acute EAE in Nrf2(-/-) and WT mice, suggest that the antiinflammatory activity of DMF in treatment of MS patients may occur through alternative pathways, independent of Nrf2.", "year": "2016", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}, {"paperId": "29363907", "title": "Effect of dimethyl fumarate on heme oxygenase-1 expression in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rats.", "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmunological disease leading to neurodegeneration. The etiology of the disease remains unknown, which strongly impedes the development of effective therapy. Most MS treatments focus on modulating the activity of the immune system. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) exerts a broad spectrum of action, such as modulating immune cell differentiation towards anti-inflammatory subtypes, influencing cytokine production, regulating immune cell migration into the central nervous system, and activating intracellular antioxidant mechanisms. It is well established that activation of the nuclear factor E2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathway, leading to expression of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, is influenced by DMF. In our experiments we used female Lewis rats in an animal model of MS - experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The rats were fed with dimethyl fumarate to test the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), one of the second-phase antioxidant enzymes, at specific time points of the symptomatic phases of the disease: on the first day of the occurrence of clinical symptoms (10th day post immunization, DPI); at the peak of clinical symptoms (14th DPI); and at the end of the relapse (21st DPI). The results showed that HO-1 expression, at both the mRNA and protein level, is influenced by DMF administration only at the very beginning of the symptomatic phase of EAE, and not at the peak of clinical symptoms, nor at the end of the relapse. This indicates that the regulation of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway by DMF occurs at a certain time interval (early EAE/MS) and strongly underlines the importance of the earliest introduction of the therapy to the patient. .", "year": "2017", "venue": "Folia neuropathologica"}, {"paperId": "36052340", "title": "Gliosis attenuation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by a combination of dimethyl fumarate and pregabalin.", "abstract": "Dysregulated microglia and astrocytes have been associated with progressive neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS), highlighting the need for strategies that additionally target intrinsic inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS).

The induction of Nrf2 signaling has been shown to inhibit disease development and progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS in mice. In the present study, we performed a high-throughput screening assay using a chimeric construct of the N-terminal portion of Nrf2 fused to LacZ. Using this approach, we identified the novel Nrf2 inducer TFM-735. Using human primary cell profiling systems, we found that TFM-735 inhibited T cell proliferation and exerted immuno-modulatory effects by inhibiting the production of IL-6 and IL-17. TFM-735 also inhibited IL-17 secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. In EAE mice treated with TFM-735, the expression of the Nrf2 target gene Nqo1 increased in the brain and spleen, disease severity was ameliorated, and plasma IL-17 levels decreased.

Treating astrocytes or neurons with DMF or MMF also significantly improved cell viability after toxic oxidative challenge in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect on viability was lost in cells that had eliminated or reduced Nrf2. These data suggest that DMF and MMF are cytoprotective for neurons and astrocytes against oxidative stress-induced cellular injury and loss, potentially via up-regulation of an Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P<0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

Here we present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resistance analyses from the phase 3 ACTT-1 randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted in adult participants hospitalized with COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nSwab samples were collected at baseline and longitudinally through day 29. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Phenotypic analysis was conducted directly on participant virus isolates and/or using SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic replicons expressing mutations identified in the Nsp12 target gene.\nRESULTS\nAmong participants with both baseline and postbaseline sequencing data, emergent Nsp12 substitutions were observed in 12 of 31 (38.7%) and 12 of 30 (40.0%) participants in the remdesivir and placebo arms, respectively. No emergent Nsp12 substitutions in the remdesivir arm were observed in more than 1 participant. Phenotyping showed low to no change in susceptibility to remdesivir relative to wild-type Nsp12 reference for the substitutions tested: A16V (0.8-fold change in EC50), P323L + V792I (2.2-fold), C799F (2.5-fold), K59N (1.0-fold), and K59N + V792I (3.4-fold).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe similar rate of emerging Nsp12 substitutions in the remdesivir and placebo arms and the minimal change in remdesivir susceptibility among tested substitutions support a high barrier to remdesivir resistance development in COVID-19 patients.

Unlike some antivirals, remdesivir has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. In the pivotal ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, daily intravenous infusions of remdesivir significantly reduced time to recovery relative to placebo. Subsequent trials provided additional support for the efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe COVID-19, with a greater benefit seen in patients with minimal oxygen requirements at baseline. Clinical trials also demonstrated the efficacy of remdesivir in other patient populations, including outpatients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, as well as hospitalized paediatric patients. In terms of mortality, results were equivocal. However, remdesivir appeared to have a small mortality benefit in hospitalized patients who were not already being ventilated at baseline. Remdesivir was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, but pharmacovigilance data found an increased risk of hepatic, renal and cardiovascular adverse drug reactions in the real-world setting. In conclusion, remdesivir represents a useful treatment option for patients with COVID-19, particularly those who require supplemental oxygen.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36442063\">Title: Temporal Improvements in COVID-19 Outcomes for Hospitalized Adults: A Post Hoc Observational Study of Remdesivir Group Participants in the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial.\nAuthors: Potter, Gail E, Bonnett, Tyler, Rubenstein, Kevin et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Annals of internal medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe COVID-19 standard of care (SOC) evolved rapidly during 2020 and 2021, but its cumulative effect over time is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate whether recovery and mortality improved as SOC evolved, using data from ACTT (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial).\nDESIGN\nACTT is a series of phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated COVID-19 therapeutics from February 2020 through May 2021. ACTT-1 compared remdesivir plus SOC to placebo plus SOC, and in ACTT-2 and ACTT-3, remdesivir plus SOC was the control group. This post hoc analysis compared recovery and mortality between these comparable sequential cohorts of patients who received remdesivir plus SOC, adjusting for baseline characteristics with propensity score weighting. The analysis was repeated for participants in ACTT-3 and ACTT-4 who received remdesivir plus dexamethasone plus SOC. Trends in SOC that could explain outcome improvements were analyzed. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04280705 [ACTT-1], NCT04401579 [ACTT-2], NCT04492475 [ACTT-3], and NCT04640168 [ACTT-4]).\nSETTING\n94 hospitals in 10 countries (86% U.S. participants).\nPARTICIPANTS\nAdults hospitalized with COVID-19.\nINTERVENTION\nSOC.\nMEASUREMENTS\n28-day mortality and recovery.\nRESULTS\nAlthough outcomes were better in ACTT-2 than in ACTT-1, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were close to 1 (HR for recovery, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.17]; HR for mortality, 0.90 [CI, 0.56 to 1.40]). Comparable patients were less likely to be intubated in ACTT-2 than in ACTT-1 (odds ratio, 0.75 [CI, 0.53 to 0.97]), and hydroxychloroquine use decreased. Outcomes improved from ACTT-2 to ACTT-3 (HR for recovery, 1.43 [CI, 1.24 to 1.64]; HR for mortality, 0.45 [CI, 0.21 to 0.97]). Potential explanatory factors (SOC trends, case surges, and variant trends) were similar between ACTT-2 and ACTT-3, except for increased dexamethasone use (11% to 77%). Outcomes were similar in ACTT-3 and ACTT-4. Antibiotic use decreased gradually across all stages.\nLIMITATION\nUnmeasured confounding.\nCONCLUSION\nChanges in patient composition explained improved outcomes from ACTT-1 to ACTT-2 but not from ACTT-2 to ACTT-3, suggesting improved SOC. These results support excluding nonconcurrent controls from analysis of platform trials in rapidly changing therapeutic areas.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">33264556 Solidarity remdesivir</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

Lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon (IFN)-β1a were discontinued for futility but randomisation to remdesivir continued. Here, we report the final results of Solidarity and meta-analyses of mortality in all relevant trials to date.\nMETHODS\nSolidarity enrolled consenting adults (aged ≥18 years) recently hospitalised with, in the view of their doctor, definite COVID-19 and no contraindication to any of the study drugs, regardless of any other patient characteristics. Participants were randomly allocated, in equal proportions between the locally available options, to receive whichever of the four study drugs (lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, IFN-β1a, or remdesivir) were locally available at that time or no study drug (controls). All patients also received the local standard of care. No placebos were given. The protocol-specified primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, subdivided by disease severity. Secondary endpoints were progression to ventilation if not already ventilated, and time-to-discharge from hospital. Final log-rank and Kaplan-Meier analyses are presented for remdesivir, and are appended for all four study drugs. Meta-analyses give weighted averages of the mortality findings in this and all other randomised trials of these drugs among hospital inpatients. Solidarity is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN83971151, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948.\nFINDINGS\nBetween March 22, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021, 14 304 potentially eligible patients were recruited from 454 hospitals in 35 countries in all six WHO regions. After the exclusion of 83 (0·6%) patients with a refuted COVID-19 diagnosis or encrypted consent not entered into the database, Solidarity enrolled 14 221 patients, including 8275 randomly allocated (1:1) either to remdesivir (ten daily infusions, unless discharged earlier) or to its control (allocated no study drug although remdesivir was locally available). Compliance was high in both groups. Overall, 602 (14·5%) of 4146 patients assigned to remdesivir died versus 643 (15·6%) of 4129 assigned to control (mortality rate ratio [RR] 0·91 [95% CI 0·82-1·02], p=0·12). Of those already ventilated, 151 (42·1%) of 359 assigned to remdesivir died versus 134 (38·6%) of 347 assigned to control (RR 1·13 [0·89-1·42], p=0·32). Of those not ventilated but on oxygen, 14·6% assigned to remdesivir died versus 16·3% assigned to control (RR 0·87 [0·76-0·99], p=0·03). Of 1730 not on oxygen initially, 2·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus 3·8% assigned to control (RR 0·76 [0·46-1·28], p=0·30). Combining all those not ventilated initially, 11·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus 13·5% assigned to control (RR 0·86 [0·76-0·98], p=0·02) and 14·1% versus 15·7% progressed to ventilation (RR 0·88 [0·77-1·00], p=0·04). The non-prespecified composite outcome of death or progression to ventilation occurred in 19·6% assigned to remdesivir versus 22·5% assigned to control (RR 0·84 [0·75-0·93], p=0·001). Allocation to daily remdesivir infusions (vs open-label control) delayed discharge by about 1 day during the 10-day treatment period. A meta-analysis of mortality in all randomised trials of remdesivir versus no remdesivir yielded similar findings.\nINTERPRETATION\nRemdesivir has no significant effect on patients with COVID-19 who are already being ventilated. Among other hospitalised patients, it has a small effect against death or progression to ventilation (or both).\nFUNDING\nWHO.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33264556\">Title: Repurposed Antiviral Drugs for Covid-19 - Interim WHO Solidarity Trial Results.\nAuthors: Pan, Hongchao, Peto, Richard, Henao-Restrepo, Ana-Maria et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nWorld Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs - remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a - in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry.\nRESULTS\nAt 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P = 0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P = 0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P = 0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P = 0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P<0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

Unlike some antivirals, remdesivir has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. In the pivotal ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, daily intravenous infusions of remdesivir significantly reduced time to recovery relative to placebo. Subsequent trials provided additional support for the efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with moderate or severe COVID-19, with a greater benefit seen in patients with minimal oxygen requirements at baseline. Clinical trials also demonstrated the efficacy of remdesivir in other patient populations, including outpatients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, as well as hospitalized paediatric patients. In terms of mortality, results were equivocal. However, remdesivir appeared to have a small mortality benefit in hospitalized patients who were not already being ventilated at baseline. Remdesivir was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, but pharmacovigilance data found an increased risk of hepatic, renal and cardiovascular adverse drug reactions in the real-world setting.

ACTT-1 compared remdesivir plus SOC to placebo plus SOC, and in ACTT-2 and ACTT-3, remdesivir plus SOC was the control group. This post hoc analysis compared recovery and mortality between these comparable sequential cohorts of patients who received remdesivir plus SOC, adjusting for baseline characteristics with propensity score weighting. The analysis was repeated for participants in ACTT-3 and ACTT-4 who received remdesivir plus dexamethasone plus SOC. Trends in SOC that could explain outcome improvements were analyzed.

Comparable patients were less likely to be intubated in ACTT-2 than in ACTT-1 (odds ratio, 0.75 [CI, 0.53 to 0.97]), and hydroxychloroquine use decreased. Outcomes improved from ACTT-2 to ACTT-3 (HR for recovery, 1.43 [CI, 1.24 to 1.64]; HR for mortality, 0.45 [CI, 0.21 to 0.97]). Potential explanatory factors (SOC trends, case surges, and variant trends) were similar between ACTT-2 and ACTT-3, except for increased dexamethasone use (11% to 77%). Outcomes were similar in ACTT-3 and ACTT-4. Antibiotic use decreased gradually across all stages.\nLIMITATION\nUnmeasured confounding.\nCONCLUSION\nChanges in patient composition explained improved outcomes from ACTT-1 to ACTT-2 but not from ACTT-2 to ACTT-3, suggesting improved SOC.

Lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon (IFN)-β1a were discontinued for futility but randomisation to remdesivir continued. Here, we report the final results of Solidarity and meta-analyses of mortality in all relevant trials to date.\nMETHODS\nSolidarity enrolled consenting adults (aged ≥18 years) recently hospitalised with, in the view of their doctor, definite COVID-19 and no contraindication to any of the study drugs, regardless of any other patient characteristics. Participants were randomly allocated, in equal proportions between the locally available options, to receive whichever of the four study drugs (lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, IFN-β1a, or remdesivir) were locally available at that time or no study drug (controls). All patients also received the local standard of care. No placebos were given. The protocol-specified primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, subdivided by disease severity. Secondary endpoints were progression to ventilation if not already ventilated, and time-to-discharge from hospital. Final log-rank and Kaplan-Meier analyses are presented for remdesivir, and are appended for all four study drugs. Meta-analyses give weighted averages of the mortality findings in this and all other randomised trials of these drugs among hospital inpatients. Solidarity is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN83971151, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948.\nFINDINGS\nBetween March 22, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021, 14 304 potentially eligible patients were recruited from 454 hospitals in 35 countries in all six WHO regions. After the exclusion of 83 (0·6%) patients with a refuted COVID-19 diagnosis or encrypted consent not entered into the database, Solidarity enrolled 14 221 patients, including 8275 randomly allocated (1:1) either to remdesivir (ten daily infusions, unless discharged earlier) or to its control (allocated no study drug although remdesivir was locally available). Compliance was high in both groups. Overall, 602 (14·5%) of 4146 patients assigned to remdesivir died versus 643 (15·6%) of 4129 assigned to control (mortality rate ratio [RR] 0·91 [95% CI 0·82-1·02], p=0·12). Of those already ventilated, 151 (42·1%) of 359 assigned to remdesivir died versus 134 (38·6%) of 347 assigned to control (RR 1·13 [0·89-1·42], p=0·32). Of those not ventilated but on oxygen, 14·6% assigned to remdesivir died versus 16·3% assigned to control (RR 0·87 [0·76-0·99], p=0·03). Of 1730 not on oxygen initially, 2·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus 3·8% assigned to control (RR 0·76 [0·46-1·28], p=0·30). Combining all those not ventilated initially, 11·9% assigned to remdesivir died versus 13·5% assigned to control (RR 0·86 [0·76-0·98], p=0·02) and 14·1% versus 15·7% progressed to ventilation (RR 0·88 [0·77-1·00], p=0·04). The non-prespecified composite outcome of death or progression to ventilation occurred in 19·6% assigned to remdesivir versus 22·5% assigned to control (RR 0·84 [0·75-0·93], p=0·001). Allocation to daily remdesivir infusions (vs open-label control) delayed discharge by about 1 day during the 10-day treatment period. A meta-analysis of mortality in all randomised trials of remdesivir versus no remdesivir yielded similar findings.\nINTERPRETATION\nRemdesivir has no significant effect on patients with COVID-19 who are already being ventilated. Among other hospitalised patients, it has a small effect against death or progression to ventilation (or both).\nFUNDING\nWHO.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Lancet (London, England)"}, {"paperId": "33264556", "title": "Repurposed Antiviral Drugs for Covid-19 - Interim WHO Solidarity Trial Results.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWorld Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of four repurposed antiviral drugs - remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a - in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned inpatients with Covid-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to five options, four active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the four pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry.\nRESULTS\nAt 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P = 0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P = 0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P = 0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P = 0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

The key secondary outcome was clinical status at day 15.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1033 patients underwent randomization (with 515 assigned to combination treatment and 518 to control). Patients receiving baricitinib had a median time to recovery of 7 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 8), as compared with 8 days (95% CI, 7 to 9) with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.32; P = 0.03), and a 30% higher odds of improvement in clinical status at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6).

The 28-day mortality was 5.1% in the combination group and 7.8% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09). Serious adverse events were less frequent in the combination group than in the control group (16.0% vs. 21.0%; difference, -5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.8 to -0.3; P = 0.03), as were new infections (5.9% vs. 11.2%; difference, -5.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.7 to -1.9; P = 0.003).\nCONCLUSIONS\nBaricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with Covid-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation. The combination was associated with fewer serious adverse events.

However, no studies have investigated the benefit of triple therapy of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and baricitinib. We investigate the benefits of triple therapy compared to dual therapy of dexamethasone with remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 on HFNC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective data analysis was performed on patients with severe COVID-19 requiring HFNC and evaluated for hospital discharge status, requirement of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and days on HFNC.\nRESULTS\nAmong 191 patients with severe COVID-19, 81 patients received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and baricitinib. Patients receiving triple therapy had a significant survival benefit (HR 0.52; P =0.042). Treatment with triple therapy vs. dual therapy also trended towards less requirement of mechanical ventilation (OR 0.66; P =0.26). There was no significant change in length of stay (mean 13.74 vs. 13.31; P =0.74) or days on HFNC (mean 8.95 vs. 7.28 days, P =0.16).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and baricitinib in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring HFNC was associated with a significant survival benefit in comparison to dual therapy of dexamethasone with remdesivir.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38408357\">Title: A Risk Profile Using Simple Hematologic Parameters to Assess Benefits From Baricitinib in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial-2.\nAuthors: Paules, Catharine I, Wang, Jing, Tomashek, Kay M et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Annals of internal medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe ACTT risk profile, which was developed from ACTT-1 (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial-1), demonstrated that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the high-risk quartile (characterized by low absolute lymphocyte count [ALC], high absolute neutrophil count [ANC], and low platelet count at baseline) benefited most from treatment with the antiviral remdesivir. It is unknown which patient characteristics are associated with benefit from treatment with the immunomodulator baricitinib.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo apply the ACTT risk profile to the ACTT-2 cohort to investigate potential baricitinib-related treatment effects by risk quartile.\nDESIGN\nPost hoc analysis of ACTT-2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04401579).\nSETTING\nSixty-seven trial sites in 8 countries.\nPARTICIPANTS\nAdults hospitalized with COVID-19 ( n = 999; 85% U.S. participants).\nINTERVENTION\nBaricitinib+remdesivir versus placebo+remdesivir.\nMEASUREMENTS\nMortality, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death, and recovery, all within 28 days; ALC, ANC, and platelet count trajectories.\nRESULTS\nIn the high-risk quartile, baricitinib+remdesivir was associated with reduced risk for death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.86]; P = 0.020), decreased progression to IMV or death (HR, 0.57 [CI, 0.35 to 0.93]; P = 0.024), and improved recovery rate (HR, 1.53 [CI, 1.16 to 2.02]; P = 0.002) compared with placebo+remdesivir. After 5 days, participants receiving baricitinib+remdesivir had significantly larger increases in ALC and significantly larger decreases in ANC compared with control participants, with the largest effects observed in the high-risk quartile.\nLIMITATION\nSecondary analysis of data collected before circulation of current SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nCONCLUSION\nThe ACTT risk profile identifies a subgroup of hospitalized patients who benefit most from baricitinib treatment and captures a patient phenotype of treatment response to an immunomodulator and an antiviral. Changes in ALC and ANC trajectory suggest a mechanism whereby an immunomodulator limits severe COVID-19.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33068263\">Title: Immune Therapy, or Antiviral Therapy, or Both for COVID-19: A Systematic Review.\nAuthors: Cantini, Fabrizio, Goletti, Delia, Petrone, Linda et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Drugs\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nBased on current evidence, recent guidelines of the National Institute of Health, USA indicated the use of remdesivir and dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease, not requiring high-flow oxygen. No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the disease was indicated.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this review was to assess the clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported.\nMETHODS\nThe efficacy assessment of the different treatments was performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020.\nRESULTS\nAfter the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3 of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials. Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial. Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of other immune therapies were not conclusive.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBeyond the supportive therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The promising results of anakinra should be confirmed by the ongoing RCTs.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34358107\">Title: Current Status of Baricitinib as a Repurposed Therapy for COVID-19.\nAuthors: Saber-Ayad, Maha, Hammoudeh, Sarah, Abu-Gharbieh, Eman et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)\nAbstract: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has mandated the instant (re)search for potential drug candidates. In response to the unprecedented situation, it was recognized early that repurposing of available drugs in the market could timely save lives, by skipping the lengthy phases of preclinical and initial safety studies. BenevolentAI's large knowledge graph repository of structured medical information suggested baricitinib, a Janus-associated kinase inhibitor, as a potential repurposed medicine with a dual mechanism; hindering SARS-CoV2 entry and combatting the cytokine storm; the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19. However, the recently-published Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial-2 (ACTT-2) positioned baricitinib only in combination with remdesivir for treatment of a specific category of COVID-19 patients, whereas the drug is not recommended to be used alone except in clinical trials. The increased pace of data output in all life sciences fields has changed our understanding of data processing and manipulation. For the purpose of drug design, development, or repurposing, the integration of different disciplines of life sciences is highly recommended to achieve the ultimate benefit of using new technologies to mine BIG data, however, the final say remains to be concluded after the drug is used in clinical practice. This review demonstrates different bioinformatics, chemical, pharmacological, and clinical aspects of baricitinib to highlight the repurposing journey of the drug and evaluates its placement in the current guidelines for COVID-19 treatment.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">32445440 remdesivir trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P<0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

The antiviral remdesivir is one component of treating COVID-19. Unfortunately, the trials evaluating remdesivir have reported mixed results, leading to uncertainty on when to use remdesivir. This review discusses the trials evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir for COVID-19 and other supporting data to help inform the role of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nSince the start of the pandemic, there have been four randomized trials of remdesivir in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19. More recently, extensive observational studies have provided supportive data.\nSUMMARY\nThe majority of trials evaluating remdesivir suggest that remdesivir is effective in the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Although there may be a benefit in some subgroups more than others, there is insufficient data to make definitive statements about benefits or lack of benefits in particular groups. Remdesivir has demonstrated clinical benefits such as decreased time in the hospital, lower progression to mechanical ventilation, and decreased utilization of other hospital resources; it is unclear if it reduces mortality, but one randomized controlled trial suggested possible survival benefits. Based on the data available, remdesivir has been approved (or authorized for early use) in 48 countries.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37355792\">Title: Study of Efficacy of Injection Remdesivir in Patients of COVID-19.\nAuthors: Chaudhary, Bharat R, Dudhrejia, Prafful J, Gambhir, Rahul M et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nThe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Injectable remdesivir (RDV), a repurposed antiviral, was first accorded approval by the United States of America (USA) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 1st May 2020, for emergency use to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Interim analysis of the Solidarity trial revealed no benefits in patients treated with RDV in any group of patients with COVID-19. Here, we have attempted to place our data on the efficacy of RDV in patients of COVID-19 with moderate to severe categories.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective review and data analysis of 100 COVID-19 patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/rapid antigen test positive was performed. Among them, 50 received RDV in addition to the standard treatment protocol (STP), while the remaining 50 received only the STP. STP is an injectable steroid and heparin, along with other supportive management. Prevalent government guidelines were followed as per usual for the classification of the patients and treatment protocol. Every day of hospitalization, the status of respiratory support was checked, and every 3rd-day inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer] were measured until the patient was discharged or died. Statistical analysis of the data was done using online software.\nRESULTS\nAge and comorbidity distribution in both groups ensures adequate matching between the two groups. A statistically significant difference in hospitalization days was obtained in RDV-treated patients (15 vs 19 days, p-value -0.003). Statistically significant differences were not found in mortality (6 vs 10 deaths, p-value -0.27) and reduction in oxygen (O2)/ventilatory support requirements (p-value -0.75) in the RDV group as compared to other groups. The difference in the value of CRP (p-value 0.001) and D-dimer (p-value 0.049) on day 5 is statistically significant in the RDV group as compared to the other groups.\nDISCUSSION\nThe finding of a reduction in days of hospitalization was similar to the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) 1 study conducted by Beigel et&nbsp;al. The mortality data were also comparable to those from WHO's Solidarity trial. No similarity was found in data on the reduction in ordinal scale from higher to lower scale for O2/ventilatory support on day 10 from 0. Similarity regarding the reduction in values of inflammatory markers on day 5 was found in studies conducted by Kannan et&nbsp;al. and Stoeckle et&nbsp;al.\nCONCLUSION\nWe found mortality benefit and reduction in O2 requirements/ventilatory support in RDV plus STP-administered cases as compared to STP only, but statistically, this difference is not significant, which suggests that mortality benefit in the RDV group in our study is merely by chance. Here, we can definitely conclude that days of hospital stay and inflammatory markers are reduced in the RDV plus STP-administered group, and the difference between the two groups is statistically significant, which suggests that early use of RDV could shorten the time to clinical improvement.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32649078\">Title: Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 - Preliminary Report.

Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed.

World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Injectable remdesivir (RDV), a repurposed antiviral, was first accorded approval by the United States of America (USA) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 1st May 2020, for emergency use to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Interim analysis of the Solidarity trial revealed no benefits in patients treated with RDV in any group of patients with COVID-19. Here, we have attempted to place our data on the efficacy of RDV in patients of COVID-19 with moderate to severe categories.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective review and data analysis of 100 COVID-19 patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/rapid antigen test positive was performed. Among them, 50 received RDV in addition to the standard treatment protocol (STP), while the remaining 50 received only the STP. STP is an injectable steroid and heparin, along with other supportive management. Prevalent government guidelines were followed as per usual for the classification of the patients and treatment protocol. Every day of hospitalization, the status of respiratory support was checked, and every 3rd-day inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer] were measured until the patient was discharged or died. Statistical analysis of the data was done using online software.\nRESULTS\nAge and comorbidity distribution in both groups ensures adequate matching between the two groups. A statistically significant difference in hospitalization days was obtained in RDV-treated patients (15 vs 19 days, p-value -0.003). Statistically significant differences were not found in mortality (6 vs 10 deaths, p-value -0.27) and reduction in oxygen (O2)/ventilatory support requirements (p-value -0.75) in the RDV group as compared to other groups. The difference in the value of CRP (p-value 0.001) and D-dimer (p-value 0.049) on day 5 is statistically significant in the RDV group as compared to the other groups.\nDISCUSSION\nThe finding of a reduction in days of hospitalization was similar to the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) 1 study conducted by Beigel et&nbsp;al. The mortality data were also comparable to those from WHO's Solidarity trial. No similarity was found in data on the reduction in ordinal scale from higher to lower scale for O2/ventilatory support on day 10 from 0. Similarity regarding the reduction in values of inflammatory markers on day 5 was found in studies conducted by Kannan et&nbsp;al. and Stoeckle et&nbsp;al.\nCONCLUSION\nWe found mortality benefit and reduction in O2 requirements/ventilatory support in RDV plus STP-administered cases as compared to STP only, but statistically, this difference is not significant, which suggests that mortality benefit in the RDV group in our study is merely by chance. Here, we can definitely conclude that days of hospital stay and inflammatory markers are reduced in the RDV plus STP-administered group, and the difference between the two groups is statistically significant, which suggests that early use of RDV could shorten the time to clinical improvement.", "year": "2023", "venue": "The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India"}, {"paperId": "32649078", "title": "Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 - Preliminary Report.

Peripheral arterial disease when associated with atherosclerosis in two or more other arterial beds such as coronary artery disease (CAD), mesenteric/renal artery and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), is known as polyvascular disease. The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry reported that 1 out of 6 patients had multi-vascular bed involvement. Progression of PAD to critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is seen in 1 % of affected patients per year, but patients who progress to CLI may have a 10- to 15-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death. The 2019 ECS/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias have suggested that for primary or secondary prevention in very high risk, patients should follow a therapeutic regimen that achieves >50 % LDL-C reduction from baseline and an LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dl. High Intensity Statin is mainstay of treatment but optimal management is inadequate. Statin treatment reduces all-cause mortality by 39 %, CV death by 41 %, CV outcomes by 34 %, ischaemic stroke by 28 %, acute limb ischaemia by 30 % and amputations by 35 %. Ezetimibe when added to statins in IMPROVE-IT trial, showed significant reduction of MACE. PCSK9 inhibitor (FOURIER TRIAL) showed reduction in primary end point in PAD vs Non PAD patients (3.5 % vs 1.6 %). There is a critical need for an Indian multi-disciplinary task force for research on the direct impact of lipid-lowering agents on limb salvage rates and major limb-related events in PAD patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37866817\">Title: Expanding the therapeutic landscape: ezetimibe as non-statin therapy for dyslipidemia.\nAuthors: Lee, Jeongmin, Lee, Seung-Hwan | Year: 2023 | Journal: The Korean journal of internal medicine\nAbstract: Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and statins are the primary therapeutic options for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, it can be challenging to achieve optimal LDL-C goals with statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, offers a potential non-statin therapy to optimize LDL-C management. Key clinical trials, such as IMPROVE-IT and RACING, have demonstrated that the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy leads to further decreases in LDL-C or significant decreases in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), particularly in patients with high ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses and clinical trials have further supported the beneficial effect of ezetimibe, suggesting additive decreases in LDL-C and MACEs, as well as pleiotropic effects. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the clinical implications of ezetimibe for managing dyslipidemia; it also evaluates the available evidence that supports the role of ezetimibe as an adjunct non-statin therapy for long-term use. However, the long-term pleiotropic effects of ezetimibe remain controversial because of limited clinical data. Therefore, additional research is needed to clarify its potential benefits beyond LDL-C reduction. Nonetheless, an understanding of the role of ezetimibe in dyslipidemia management will help clinicians to develop effective treatment strategies.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36763180\">Title: Benefit of Combination Ezetimibe/Simvastatin Among High-Risk Populations: Lessons from the IMPROVE-IT Trial.\nAuthors: Oliver, Walter, Giugliano, Robert P | Year: 2023 | Journal: Current atherosclerosis reports\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nThe Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) demonstrated the clinical benefit of the combination of ezetimibe-simvastatin compared to placebo-simvastatin following acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This review highlights key findings from this study with particular attention to the practice-changing impact on guidelines for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction after ACS, especially among high-risk populations.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nConsistent reductions in LDL-C have been reported with newer lipid-lowering therapies (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, cholesterol ester transfer proteins, bempedoic acid) in combination with statin in high-risk subgroups. Since high-risk subgroups remain a focus of guidelines, exploration of high-risk subgroups can help define the optimal use of new therapies. Ezetimibe reduced the LDL-C by 16.7 mg/dL compared to placebo at 1 year, resulting in a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint (absolute risk difference 2.0%; relative risk difference 6.4%, hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P = 0.016). The benefits achieved with ezetimibe in both LDL-C reduction and the primary clinical composite across 10 pre-specified high-risk subgroups, including the elderly; women; patients with diabetes, prior coronary artery bypass graft, history of stroke, polyvascular disease, low baseline LDL-C, renal dysfunction, prior heart failure, and an elevated TIMI risk score for secondary prevention, were similar or greater than in the corresponding non-high-risk subgroups. Safety events were similar between ezetimibe and placebo across the high-risk subgroups. These data support the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy in high-risk patients who require additional therapy to lower the LDL-C post-ACS.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"26559810\">Title: Clinical implications of the IMPROVE-IT trial in the light of current and future lipid-lowering treatment options.\nAuthors: Serban, Maria-Corina, Banach, Maciej, Mikhailidis, Dimitri P | Year: 2016 | Journal: Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nA residual risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular (CV) disease remains despite statin therapy. This situation has generated an interest in finding novel approaches of combining statins with other lipid-lowering agents, or finding new lipid and non-lipid targets, such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen or C-reactive protein.\nAREAS COVERED\nThe recent results from the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) demonstrated an incremental clinical benefit when ezetimibe, a non-statin agent, was added to simvastatin therapy.\nEXPERT OPINION\nThe results from IMPROVE-IT revalidated the concept that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are a clinically relevant treatment goal. This trial also suggested that further decrease of LDL-C levels (53 vs. 70 mg/dl; 1.4 vs. 1.8 mmol/l) was more beneficial in lowering CV events. This \"even lower is even better\" evidence for LDL-C levels may influence future guidelines and the use of new drugs. Furthermore, these findings make ezetimibe a more realistic option to treat patients with statin intolerance or those who cannot achieve LDL-C targets with statin monotherapy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31754844\">Title: Lowering Targeted Atherogenic Lipoprotein Cholesterol Goals for Patients at \"Extreme\" ASCVD Risk.\nAuthors: Rosenblit, Paul D | Year: 2019 | Journal: Current diabetes reports\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nTo review randomized interventional clinical and imaging trials that support lower targeted atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol goals in \"extreme\" and \"very high\" atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk settings. Major atherosclerotic cardiovascular event (MACE) prevention among the highest risk patients with ASCVD requires aggressive management of global risks, including lowering of the fundamental atherogenic apolipoprotein B-associated lipoprotein cholesterol particles [i.e., triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnant cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and lipoprotein(a)]. LDL-C has been the long-time focus of imaging studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The 2004 adult treatment panel (ATP-III) update recognized that the long-standing targeted LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL potentially fostered substantial undertreatment of the very highest coronary heart disease (CHD) risk individuals and was lowered to < 70 mg/dL as an \"optional\" goal for \"very high\" 10-year CHD [CHD death + myocardial infarction (MI)] risk exceeding 20%. This evidence-based guideline change was supported by the observed benefits demonstrated in the high-risk primary and secondary prevention populations in the Heart Protection Study (HPS), the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) population in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 trial (PROVE-IT), and the secondary prevention population in the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) study. Subsequent national and international guidelines maintained a targeted LDL-C goal < 70 mg/dL, or a threshold for management of > 70 mg/dL for patients with CHD, CHD risk equivalency, or ASCVD.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nSubgroup or meta-analyses of several RCTs, IVUS imaging studies, and the ACS population in IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) supported the evidence-based 2017 American Association Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE) guideline change establishing a targeted LDL-C goal < 55 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 80 mg/dl, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) < 70 mg/dL for patients at \"Extreme\" ASCVD risk, i.e., 10-year 3-point-MACE-composite (CV death, non-fatal MI, or ischemic stroke) risk exceeding 30%. Moreover, with no recognized lower-limit-associated intolerance or safety issues, even more intensive lowering of atherogenic cholesterol levels is supported by the following evidence base: (1) analysis of eight high-intensity statin-based prospective secondary prevention IVUS atheroma volume regression trials; (2) a distribution analysis of on-treatment, ezetimibe and background-statin, of the very low LDL-C levels reached and CVD event risk in the IMPROVE-IT ACS population; (3) the secondary prevention Global Assessment of Pl\\aque Regression With a PCSK9 Antibody as Measured by Intravascular Ultrasound (GLAGOV) on background-statin; and (4) the secondary prevention population of Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER). By example, in FOURIER, the population on background-statin at a baseline median 92 mg/dL achieved median LDL-C level of 30 mg/dL and non-HDL-C to < 65 mg/dl, and apo B to < 50 mg/dL, and subgroup and post hoc analyses all demonstrated additional ASCVD event reduction benefits as LDL-C was further reduced. The level of ASCVD risk determines the degree, urgency, and persistence in global risk management, including fundamental atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol particle lowering. \"Extreme\" risk patients may require extremely low targeted LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apo B goals; such efforts, implied by more recent interventional trials and analyses, are aimed at maximal atheroma plaque regression, stabilization, and MACE event reduction with the aspiration of improved quality lifespan.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039521/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">28304224 FOURIER LDL-C achieved</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 31 results.

However, large-scale, long-term data are lacking.\nMETHODS\nThe parent FOURIER trial randomized 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on statin to evolocumab versus placebo. Patients completing FOURIER at participating sites were eligible to receive evolocumab in 2 open-label extension studies (FOURIER-OLE [FOURIER Open-Label Extension]) in the United States and Europe; primary analyses were pooled across studies. The primary end point was the incidence of adverse events. Lipid values and major adverse cardiovascular events were prospectively collected.\nRESULTS\nA total of 6635 patients were enrolled in FOURIER-OLE (3355 randomized to evolocumab and 3280 to placebo in the parent study). Median follow-up in FOURIER-OLE was 5.0 years; maximum exposure to evolocumab in parent plus FOURIER-OLE was 8.4 years. At 12 weeks in FOURIER-OLE, median LDL-C was 30 mg/dL, and 63.2% of patients achieved LDL-C <40 mg/dL on evolocumab. Incidences of serious adverse events, muscle-related events, new-onset diabetes, hemorrhagic stroke, and neurocognitive events with evolocumab long term did not exceed those for placebo-treated patients during the parent study and did not increase over time. During the FOURIER-OLE follow-up period, patients originally randomized in the parent trial to evolocumab versus placebo had a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.96]; P =0.008); a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68-0.93]; P =0.003); and a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60-0.99]; P =0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLong-term LDL-C lowering with evolocumab was associated with persistently low rates of adverse events for >8 years that did not exceed those observed in the original placebo arm during the parent study and led to further reductions in cardiovascular events compared with delayed treatment initiation.\nREGISTRATION\nURL: https://www.\nCLINICALTRIALS\ngov; Unique identifiers: NCT02867813 and NCT03080935.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36779348\">Title: Association Between Achieved Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels and Long-Term Cardiovascular and Safety Outcomes: An Analysis of FOURIER-OLE.\nAuthors: Gaba, Prakriti, O'Donoghue, Michelle L, Park, Jeong-Gun et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Circulation\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, the optimal achieved LDL-C level with regard to efficacy and safety in the long term remains unknown.\nMETHODS\nIn FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk), 27 564 patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to evolocumab versus placebo, with a median follow-up of 2.2 years. In the open-label extension (FOURIER-OLE), 6635 of these patients were transitioned to open-label evolocumab regardless of initial treatment allocation in the parent trial and were followed for an additional median of 5 years. In this prespecified analysis, we examined the relationship between achieved LDL-C levels (an average of the first 2 LDL-C levels measured) in FOURIER-OLE (available in 6559 patients) and the incidence of subsequent cardiovascular and safety outcomes. We also performed sensitivity analyses evaluating cardiovascular and safety outcomes in the entire FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE patient population. Multivariable modeling was used to adjust for baseline factors associated with achieved LDL-C levels.\nRESULTS\nIn FOURIER-OLE, 1604 (24%), 2627 (40%), 1031 (16%), 486 (7%), and 811 (12%) patients achieved LDL-C levels of <20, 20 to <40, 40 to <55, 55 to <70, and ≥70 mg/dL, respectively. There was a monotonic relationship between lower achieved LDL-C levels-down to very low levels <20 mg/dL-and a lower risk of the primary efficacy end point (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary efficacy end point (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) that persisted after multivariable adjustment (adjusted P trend <0.0001 for each end points). No statistically significant associations existed in the primary analyses between lower achieved LDL-C levels and increased risk of the safety outcomes (serious adverse events, new or recurrent cancer, cataract-related adverse events, hemorrhagic stroke, new-onset diabetes, neurocognitive adverse events, muscle-related events, or noncardiovascular death). Similar findings were noted in the entire FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE cohort up to a maximum follow-up of 8.6 years.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, long-term achievement of lower LDL-C levels, down to <20 mg/dL (<0.5 mmol/L), was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes with no significant safety concerns.\nREGISTRATION\nURL: https://www.\nCLINICALTRIALS\ngov; Unique identifier: NCT01764633.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28988500\">Title: A safety evaluation of evolocumab.\nAuthors: Roth, Eli M | Year: 2018 | Journal: Expert opinion on drug safety\nAbstract: Evolocumab is an injectable, fully human monoclonal antibody and a member of the newest class of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering agents called proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. The PCSK9 inhibitors are the most significant advance in lipid therapy since the introduction of the first statin 30 years ago. Areas covered: The PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated a consistently high LDL-C lowering efficacy with and without statins and/or other lipid lowering therapies (LLT). LDL-C levels achieved with these agents are lower than has ever been possible before. This review will focus on the overall safety of evolocumab including cognitive impairment, very low LDL-C levels, new onset diabetes and glucose abnormalities, effect on vitamin E and steroid hormones, liver and muscle abnormalities, and immunogenicity and injection site reactions. The phase II and III clinical trials had relatively low patient-years of exposure, but the open label extension studies and the recently published outcomes trial, FOURIER, will be the focus of this paper. The safety profile of evolocumab to date is remarkable and extremely encouraging as will be demonstrated. Expert opinion: The PCSK9 inhibitors will be responsible for a new era in lipid therapy that will expand our knowledge of lipid levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention with an efficacy and safety profile not previously available in clinical practice.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28925859\">Title: Effects of Evolocumab on Cardiovascular Events.\nAuthors: Mikhail, Nasser | Year: 2017 | Journal: Current cardiology reviews\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nEvolocumab is a potent lipid-lowering drug that decreases plasma levels of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 50-60%. FOURIER is a landmark randomized trial involving 27,564 patients with established cardiovascular disease already on statins and plasma LDLC levels > 70 mg/dl.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe main objective of FOURIER was to examine the effects of evolocumab on cardiovascular events.\nRESULTS\nAfter a mean follow-up of 2.2 years, evolocumab significantly decreased the primary endpoint (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) by 15% compared to placebo [hazard ratio 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79-0.92)], but no significant effect was found on mortality. The most common adverse effect of evolocumab was mild injection site reaction occurring in 2.1% of patients versus 1.6% of patients receiving placebo.\nCONCLUSION\nThese results support the use of evolocumab as add-on therapy to statins for high cardiac- risk patients not achieving optimal goals of LDL-C. Longer-term studies are needed to further clarify the efficacy and safety of evolocumab.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38224837\">Title: Dyslipidemia and peripheral arterial disease.\nAuthors: Yadav, Ajay, Sawant, Vivek, Singh Bedi, Varinder et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Indian heart journal\nAbstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects 12 % of adult population and is increasing globally and in India. Peripheral arterial disease when associated with atherosclerosis in two or more other arterial beds such as coronary artery disease (CAD), mesenteric/renal artery and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), is known as polyvascular disease. The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry reported that 1 out of 6 patients had multi-vascular bed involvement. Progression of PAD to critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is seen in 1 % of affected patients per year, but patients who progress to CLI may have a 10- to 15-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death. The 2019 ECS/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias have suggested that for primary or secondary prevention in very high risk, patients should follow a therapeutic regimen that achieves >50 % LDL-C reduction from baseline and an LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dl. High Intensity Statin is mainstay of treatment but optimal management is inadequate. Statin treatment reduces all-cause mortality by 39 %, CV death by 41 %, CV outcomes by 34 %, ischaemic stroke by 28 %, acute limb ischaemia by 30 % and amputations by 35 %. Ezetimibe when added to statins in IMPROVE-IT trial, showed significant reduction of MACE. PCSK9 inhibitor (FOURIER TRIAL) showed reduction in primary end point in PAD vs Non PAD patients (3.5 % vs 1.6 %). There is a critical need for an Indian multi-disciplinary task force for research on the direct impact of lipid-lowering agents on limb salvage rates and major limb-related events in PAD patients.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">IMPROVE-IT ezetimibe simvastatin 2015</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 17 results.

The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 6 years.\nRESULTS\nThe median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary end point at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.016). Rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provided additional benefit.

Given strict inclusion criteria (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50-125 mg/dL and no use of statins more potent than simvastatin 40 mg), the implications of this important trial in routine acute coronary syndrome care are unknown.\nMETHODS\nWe identified patients with acute coronary syndrome from the Veterans Affairs health care system over a 5-year period and determined what proportion would be candidates for ezetimibe on the basis of IMPROVE-IT criteria. We then evaluated what proportion could potentially see an increase in ezetimibe use if IMPROVE-IT criteria are not strictly followed.\nRESULTS\nOf 219,625 patients with acute coronary syndrome, 69,508 (31.6%) would qualify for ezetimibe on the basis of strict criteria. Among those who did not meet IMPROVE-IT criteria (n = 150,117), ezetimibe could potentially be prescribed by clinicians in a further 28% of patients (n = 61,635) using statins more potent than simvastatin 40 mg, 7.1% of patients (15,527) with a documented statin intolerance, and 10.4% of patients (22,758) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >125 mg/dL.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results provide a first look at the implications of this trial in a large health care system. Although 31.6% of patients would qualify for ezetimibe, there is a large potential for an increase in ezetimibe use in acute coronary syndrome outside of the strict trial inclusions. These findings call for a discussion on ezetimibe's role in patients with acute coronary syndrome already taking high-intensity statins or those with statin intolerance.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"26667942\">Title: [The IMPROVE-IT trial].\nAuthors: Menozzi, Alberto, Lina, Daniela, Urbinati, Stefano et al. | Year: 2015 | Journal: Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006)\nAbstract: </snippet>\n<snippet id=\"26310982\">Title: Improve-it: Full disclosures?\nAuthors: Nicot, Philippe, Guerbaai, Raphaelle-Ashley, Ennezat, Pierre-Vladimir | Year: 2015 | Journal: International journal of cardiology\nAbstract: </snippet>\n</tool_output>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039521/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039521/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Ezetimibe Added to Statin Therapy after Acute Coronary Syndromes \\nN Engl J Med. 2015 Jun 18;372(25):2387-97. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1410489.

This review highlights key findings from this study with particular attention to the practice-changing impact on guidelines for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction after ACS, especially among high-risk populations.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nConsistent reductions in LDL-C have been reported with newer lipid-lowering therapies (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, cholesterol ester transfer proteins, bempedoic acid) in combination with statin in high-risk subgroups. Since high-risk subgroups remain a focus of guidelines, exploration of high-risk subgroups can help define the optimal use of new therapies. Ezetimibe reduced the LDL-C by 16.7 mg/dL compared to placebo at 1 year, resulting in a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint (absolute risk difference 2.0%; relative risk difference 6.4%, hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P = 0.016).

This situation has generated an interest in finding novel approaches of combining statins with other lipid-lowering agents, or finding new lipid and non-lipid targets, such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen or C-reactive protein.\nAREAS COVERED\nThe recent results from the IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) demonstrated an incremental clinical benefit when ezetimibe, a non-statin agent, was added to simvastatin therapy.\nEXPERT OPINION\nThe results from IMPROVE-IT revalidated the concept that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are a clinically relevant treatment goal. This trial also suggested that further decrease of LDL-C levels (53 vs. 70 mg/dl; 1.4 vs. 1.8 mmol/l) was more beneficial in lowering CV events.

Major atherosclerotic cardiovascular event (MACE) prevention among the highest risk patients with ASCVD requires aggressive management of global risks, including lowering of the fundamental atherogenic apolipoprotein B-associated lipoprotein cholesterol particles [i.e., triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnant cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and lipoprotein(a)]. LDL-C has been the long-time focus of imaging studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The 2004 adult treatment panel (ATP-III) update recognized that the long-standing targeted LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL potentially fostered substantial undertreatment of the very highest coronary heart disease (CHD) risk individuals and was lowered to < 70 mg/dL as an \"optional\" goal for \"very high\" 10-year CHD [CHD death + myocardial infarction (MI)] risk exceeding 20%. This evidence-based guideline change was supported by the observed benefits demonstrated in the high-risk primary and secondary prevention populations in the Heart Protection Study (HPS), the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) population in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 trial (PROVE-IT), and the secondary prevention population in the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) study. Subsequent national and international guidelines maintained a targeted LDL-C goal < 70 mg/dL, or a threshold for management of > 70 mg/dL for patients with CHD, CHD risk equivalency, or ASCVD.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nSubgroup or meta-analyses of several RCTs, IVUS imaging studies, and the ACS population in IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) supported the evidence-based 2017 American Association Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE) guideline change establishing a targeted LDL-C goal < 55 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 80 mg/dl, and apolipoprotein B (apo B) < 70 mg/dL for patients at \"Extreme\" ASCVD risk, i.e., 10-year 3-point-MACE-composite (CV death, non-fatal MI, or ischemic stroke) risk exceeding 30%. Moreover, with no recognized lower-limit-associated intolerance or safety issues, even more intensive lowering of atherogenic cholesterol levels is supported by the following evidence base: (1) analysis of eight high-intensity statin-based prospective secondary prevention IVUS atheroma volume regression trials; (2) a distribution analysis of on-treatment, ezetimibe and background-statin, of the very low LDL-C levels reached and CVD event risk in the IMPROVE-IT ACS population; (3) the secondary prevention Global Assessment of Pl\\aque Regression With a PCSK9 Antibody as Measured by Intravascular Ultrasound (GLAGOV) on background-statin; and (4) the secondary prevention population of Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER). By example, in FOURIER, the population on background-statin at a baseline median 92 mg/dL achieved median LDL-C level of 30 mg/dL and non-HDL-C to < 65 mg/dl, and apo B to < 50 mg/dL, and subgroup and post hoc analyses all demonstrated additional ASCVD event reduction benefits as LDL-C was further reduced. The level of ASCVD risk determines the degree, urgency, and persistence in global risk management, including fundamental atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol particle lowering. \"Extreme\" risk patients may require extremely low targeted LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apo B goals; such efforts, implied by more recent interventional trials and analyses, are aimed at maximal atheroma plaque regression, stabilization, and MACE event reduction with the aspiration of improved quality lifespan.", "year": "2019", "venue": "Current diabetes reports"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:30:47.054049"}, {"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039521/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039521/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Ezetimibe Added to Statin Therapy after Acute Coronary Syndromes \\nN Engl J Med. 2015 Jun 18;372(25):2387-97. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1410489.

Inhibition of BRAF alone has limited activity because of pathway reactivation through epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.\nMETHODS\nIn this open-label, phase 3 trial, we enrolled 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who had had disease progression after one or two previous regimens. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators' choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) (control group). The primary end points were overall survival and objective response rate in the triplet-therapy group as compared with the control group. A secondary end point was overall survival in the doublet-therapy group as compared with the control group. We report here the results of a prespecified interim analysis.\nRESULTS\nThe median overall survival was 9.0 months in the triplet-therapy group and 5.4 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.70; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (P<0.001). The median overall survival in the doublet-therapy group was 8.4 months (hazard ratio for death vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 58% of patients in the triplet-therapy group, in 50% in the doublet-therapy group, and in 61% in the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA combination of encorafenib, cetuximab, and binimetinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and a higher response rate than standard therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation.

Historically, first-line treatment of BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC with chemotherapy regimens has had limited efficacy. The phase 3 BREAKWATER study investigated EC+mFOLFOX6 versus standard of care (SOC) in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E mCRC. The dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival is event driven; data were not mature at data cutoff. BREAKWATER met the other dual primary endpoint of objective response rate, demonstrating significant and clinically relevant improvement in objective response rate (EC+mFOLFOX6: 60.9%; SOC: 40.0%; odds ratio, 2.443; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.403-4.253; 99.8% CI: 1.019-5.855; one-sided P = 0.0008). Median duration of response was 13.9 versus 11.1 months. At this first interim analysis of overall survival, the hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.318-0.691; repeated CI: 0.166-1.322). Serious adverse event rates were 37.7% versus 34.6%. The safety profiles were consistent with those known for each agent.

In contrast to metastatic melanoma, BRAF inhibition alone or in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors has shown little utility in the treatment of BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. This is secondary to upstream activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and other escape mechanisms. Combining RAF and MEK inhibitors with inhibition of the EGFR pathway through an anti-EGFR receptor antibody (cetuximab) led to the BEACON clinical trial (binimetinib, encorafenib and cetuximab). Trial patients had undergone at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The trial met all its endpoints and is now included in NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines. Herein we provide updates in treatment options for patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC, focusing on the practice-changing BEACON-triplet regimen, the first chemotherapy-free combination regimen for mCRC. This combination is being explored frontline in the ANCHOR clinical trial.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34896698\">Title: Management of adverse events from the treatment of encorafenib plus cetuximab for patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer: insights from the BEACON CRC study.\nAuthors: Tabernero, J, Velez, L, Trevino, T L et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: ESMO open\nAbstract: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with a 5-year relative survival of 14% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients with BRAF V600E mutations, which occur in ∼10%-15% of patients with mCRC, have a poorer prognosis compared with those with wild-type BRAF tumours. The combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib with the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor cetuximab currently represents the only chemotherapy-free targeted therapy approved in the USA and Europe for previously treated patients with BRAF V600E-mutated mCRC. As a class, BRAF inhibitors are associated with dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and renal events, as well as pyrexia and secondary skin malignancies. Adverse event (AE) profiles of specific BRAF inhibitors vary, however, and are affected by the specific agents given in combination. In patients with mCRC, commonly reported AEs of cetuximab monotherapy include infusion reactions and dermatologic toxicities. Data from the phase III BEACON CRC study indicate that the combination of encorafenib with cetuximab has a distinct safety profile. Here we review the most frequently reported AEs that occurred with this combination in BEACON CRC and best practices for managing and mitigating AEs that require more than standard supportive care.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32975928/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">32975928 BEACON updated</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 104 results.

This revision, informed by the implementation experience, involved a working group appointed by the ILAE Executive Committee. Comprising 37 members from all ILAE regions, the group utilized a modified Delphi process, requiring a consensus threshold of more than two thirds for any proposal. Following public comments, the Executive Committee appointed seven additional experts to the revision task force to address and incorporate the issues raised, as appropriate. The updated classification maintains four main seizure classes: Focal, Generalized, Unknown (whether focal or generalized), and Unclassified. Taxonomic rules distinguish classifiers, which are considered to reflect biological classes and directly impact clinical management, from descriptors, which indicate other important seizure characteristics. Focal seizures and those of unknown origin are further classified by the patient's state of consciousness (impaired or preserved) during the seizure, defined operationally through clinical assessment of awareness and responsiveness. If the state of consciousness is undetermined, the seizure is classified under the parent term, that is, the main seizure class (focal seizure or seizure of unknown origin). Generalized seizures are grouped into absence seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and other generalized seizures, now including recognition of negative myoclonus as a seizure type. Seizures are described in the basic version as with or without observable manifestations, whereas an expanded version utilizes the chronological sequence of seizure semiology. This updated classification comprises four main classes and 21 seizure types. Special emphasis was placed on ensuring translatability into languages beyond English. Its aim is to establish a common language for all health care professionals involved in epilepsy care, from resource-limited areas to highly specialized centers, and to provide accessible terms for patients and caregivers.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37008993\">Title: Episodic Ataxias: Primary and Secondary Etiologies, Treatment, and Classification Approaches.\nAuthors: Hassan, Anhar | Year: 2023 | Journal: Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements (New York, N.Y.)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nEpisodic ataxia (EA), characterized by recurrent attacks of cerebellar dysfunction, is the manifestation of a group of rare autosomal dominant inherited disorders. EA1 and EA2 are most frequently encountered, caused by mutations in KCNA1 and CACNA1A . EA3-8 are reported in rare families. Advances in genetic testing have broadened the KCNA1 and CACNA1A phenotypes, and detected EA as an unusual presentation of several other genetic disorders. Additionally, there are various secondary causes of EA and mimicking disorders. Together, these can pose diagnostic challenges for neurologists.\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature review was performed in October 2022 for 'episodic ataxia' and 'paroxysmal ataxia', restricted to publications in the last 10 years to focus on recent clinical advances. Clinical, genetic, and treatment characteristics were summarized.\nRESULTS\nEA1 and EA2 phenotypes have further broadened. In particular, EA2 may be accompanied by other paroxysmal disorders of childhood with chronic neuropsychiatric features. New treatments for EA2 include dalfampridine and fampridine, in addition to 4-aminopyridine and acetazolamide. There are recent proposals for EA9-10. EA may also be caused by gene mutations associated with chronic ataxias ( SCA-14, SCA-27, SCA-42, AOA2, CAPOS ), epilepsy syndromes ( KCNA2, SCN2A, PRRT2 ), GLUT-1, mitochondrial disorders ( PDHA1, PDHX, ACO2 ), metabolic disorders (Maple syrup urine disease, Hartnup disease, type I citrullinemia, thiamine and biotin metabolism defects), and others. Secondary causes of EA are more commonly encountered than primary EA (vascular, inflammatory, toxic-metabolic). EA can be misdiagnosed as migraine, peripheral vestibular disorders, anxiety, and functional symptoms. Primary and secondary EA are frequently treatable which should prompt a search for the cause.\nDISCUSSION\nEA may be overlooked or misdiagnosed for a variety of reasons, including phenotype-genotype variability and clinical overlap between primary and secondary causes. EA is highly treatable, so it is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders. Classical EA1 and EA2 phenotypes prompt single gene test and treatment pathways. For atypical phenotypes, next generation genetic testing can aid diagnosis and guide treatment. Updated classification systems for EA are discussed which may assist diagnosis and management.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31720707\">Title: Algorithm for the management of patients at low, high and very high risk of osteoporotic fractures.\nAuthors: Kanis, J A, Harvey, N C, McCloskey, E et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA\nAbstract: UNLABELLED\nGuidance is provided in an international setting on the assessment and specific treatment of postmenopausal women at low, high and very high risk of fragility fractures.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe International Osteoporosis Foundation and European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis published guidance for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in 2019.

Despite advancements in refining CLE classification, establishing precise subtype criteria remains challenging due to overlapping presentations and difficulty in distinguishing morphology. Current treatments encompass preventive measures, topical therapies, and systemic approaches. Hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids are the sole US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for CLE, with numerous off-label treatments available. However, these treatments are often not covered by insurance, imposing a significant financial burden on patients. The exclusion of most CLE patients, particularly those without concurrent SLE, from trials designed for SLE has resulted in a lack of targeted treatments for CLE. To develop effective CLE treatments, validated outcome measures for tracking patient responsiveness are essential. The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index is widely utilized for its reliability, validity, and ability to differentiate between skin activity and damage. In contrast, the FDA mandates the use of the Investigator's Global Assessment, a five-point Likert scale related to lesion characteristics, for skin-related therapeutic trials. It requires the disease to resolve or almost completely resolve to demonstrate improvement, which can be difficult when there is residual erythema or incomplete clearance that is meaningfully improved from a patient perspective. Various classes of skin lupus medications target diverse pathways, allowing tailored treatment based on the patient's lupus inflammatory profile, resulting in improved outcomes. Promising targeted therapeutic drugs include anifrolumab (anti-type 1 interferon), deucravacitinib (allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor), litifilimab (plasmacytoid dendritic cell-directed therapy), iberdomide (cereblon-targeting ligand), and belimumab (B-cell directed therapy). Despite the significant impact of CLE on quality of life, therapeutic options remain inadequate. While promising treatments for cutaneous lupus are emerging, it is crucial to underscore the urgency for skin-focused treatment outcomes and the implementation of validated measures to assess therapeutic effectiveness in clinical trials.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">32975928 encorafenib cetuximab</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 141 results.

This result led to accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval of this investigational combination therapy for BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, including as first-line therapy. Data on progression-free survival (the second primary end point) and an updated interim analysis of overall survival are now available.\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned patients with untreated BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer to receive EC, EC+mFOLFOX6, or standard care. The two primary end points were objective response (reported previously) and progression-free survival according to blinded independent central review in the EC+mFOLFOX6 group and the standard-care group. The key secondary end point was overall survival.\nRESULTS\nSignificantly longer progression-free survival was seen with EC+mFOLFOX6 than with standard care (median, 12.8 vs. 7.1 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.68; P<0.001). In an interim analysis, overall survival was significantly longer with EC+mFOLFOX6 than with standard care (median, 30.3 vs. 15.1 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.63; P<0.001). The incidence of serious adverse events during treatment was 46.1% with EC+mFOLFOX6 and 38.9% with standard care. Safety profiles were consistent with those known for each agent.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis trial showed significantly longer progression-free survival and overall survival with first-line treatment with EC+mFOLFOX6 than with standard care among patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.

In the first-line setting, pembrolizumab is recommended for patients with mCRC and microsatellite instability-high or deficient mismatch repair tumors; chemotherapy and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair left-sided treatment-naive RAS wild-type mCRC; chemotherapy and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair RAS wild-type right-sided mCRC. Encorafenib plus cetuximab is recommended for patients with previously treated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC that has progressed after at least one previous line of therapy. Cytoreductive surgery plus systemic chemotherapy may be recommended for selected patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases; however, the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not recommended. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be recommended following systemic therapy for patients with oligometastases of the liver who are not considered candidates for resection. Selective internal radiation therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with unilobar or bilobar metastases of the liver. Perioperative chemotherapy or surgery alone should be offered to patients with mCRC who are candidates for potentially curative resection of liver metastases. Multidisciplinary team management and shared decision making are recommended. Qualifying statements with further details related to implementation of guideline recommendations are also included.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/gastrointestinal-cancer-guidelines.</snippet>\n</tool_output>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566309/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31566309/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Encorafenib, Binimetinib, and Cetuximab in _BRAF_ V600E-Mutated Colorectal Cancer \\nN Engl J Med. 2019 Oct 24;381(17):1632-1643. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1908075.

To address these issues, radially aligned grains and surface Li _x_ Ni _y_ W _z_ O-like heterostructures are designed and obtained with a simple tungsten modification strategy in the LiNi0.91Co0.045Mn0.045O2 cathode. The formation of radially aligned grains, manipulated by the WO3 modifier during synthesis, provides a fast Li+ diffusion channel during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, the tungsten tends to enter into the lattice of the primary particle surface, and the armor-type tungsten-rich heterostructure protects the bulk material from microcracks, structural transformations, and surface side reactions. First-principles calculations indicate that oxygen is more stable in the surface tungsten-rich heterostructure than elsewhere, thus triggering an improved surface structural stability. Consequently, the 2 wt % WO3-modified LiNi0.91Co0.045Mn0.045O2 (NCM@2W) material shows outstanding prolonged cycling performance (capacity retention of 80.85% after 500 cycles) and excellent rate performance (5 C, 188.4 mA h g-1). In addition, its layered-to-rock salt phase transition temperature is increased by 80 °C compared with that of the pristine cathode.

Taxonomic rules distinguish classifiers, which are considered to reflect biological classes and directly impact clinical management, from descriptors, which indicate other important seizure characteristics. Focal seizures and those of unknown origin are further classified by the patient's state of consciousness (impaired or preserved) during the seizure, defined operationally through clinical assessment of awareness and responsiveness. If the state of consciousness is undetermined, the seizure is classified under the parent term, that is, the main seizure class (focal seizure or seizure of unknown origin). Generalized seizures are grouped into absence seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and other generalized seizures, now including recognition of negative myoclonus as a seizure type.

Clinical, genetic, and treatment characteristics were summarized.\nRESULTS\nEA1 and EA2 phenotypes have further broadened. In particular, EA2 may be accompanied by other paroxysmal disorders of childhood with chronic neuropsychiatric features. New treatments for EA2 include dalfampridine and fampridine, in addition to 4-aminopyridine and acetazolamide. There are recent proposals for EA9-10. EA may also be caused by gene mutations associated with chronic ataxias ( SCA-14, SCA-27, SCA-42, AOA2, CAPOS ), epilepsy syndromes ( KCNA2, SCN2A, PRRT2 ), GLUT-1, mitochondrial disorders ( PDHA1, PDHX, ACO2 ), metabolic disorders (Maple syrup urine disease, Hartnup disease, type I citrullinemia, thiamine and biotin metabolism defects), and others. Secondary causes of EA are more commonly encountered than primary EA (vascular, inflammatory, toxic-metabolic). EA can be misdiagnosed as migraine, peripheral vestibular disorders, anxiety, and functional symptoms. Primary and secondary EA are frequently treatable which should prompt a search for the cause.\nDISCUSSION\nEA may be overlooked or misdiagnosed for a variety of reasons, including phenotype-genotype variability and clinical overlap between primary and secondary causes. EA is highly treatable, so it is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders. Classical EA1 and EA2 phenotypes prompt single gene test and treatment pathways. For atypical phenotypes, next generation genetic testing can aid diagnosis and guide treatment. Updated classification systems for EA are discussed which may assist diagnosis and management.", "year": "2023", "venue": "Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements (New York, N.Y.)"}, {"paperId": "31720707", "title": "Algorithm for the management of patients at low, high and very high risk of osteoporotic fractures.", "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nGuidance is provided in an international setting on the assessment and specific treatment of postmenopausal women at low, high and very high risk of fragility fractures.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe International Osteoporosis Foundation and European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis published guidance for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in 2019.

Despite advancements in refining CLE classification, establishing precise subtype criteria remains challenging due to overlapping presentations and difficulty in distinguishing morphology. Current treatments encompass preventive measures, topical therapies, and systemic approaches. Hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids are the sole US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for CLE, with numerous off-label treatments available. However, these treatments are often not covered by insurance, imposing a significant financial burden on patients. The exclusion of most CLE patients, particularly those without concurrent SLE, from trials designed for SLE has resulted in a lack of targeted treatments for CLE. To develop effective CLE treatments, validated outcome measures for tracking patient responsiveness are essential. The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index is widely utilized for its reliability, validity, and ability to differentiate between skin activity and damage. In contrast, the FDA mandates the use of the Investigator's Global Assessment, a five-point Likert scale related to lesion characteristics, for skin-related therapeutic trials. It requires the disease to resolve or almost completely resolve to demonstrate improvement, which can be difficult when there is residual erythema or incomplete clearance that is meaningfully improved from a patient perspective. Various classes of skin lupus medications target diverse pathways, allowing tailored treatment based on the patient's lupus inflammatory profile, resulting in improved outcomes. Promising targeted therapeutic drugs include anifrolumab (anti-type 1 interferon), deucravacitinib (allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor), litifilimab (plasmacytoid dendritic cell-directed therapy), iberdomide (cereblon-targeting ligand), and belimumab (B-cell directed therapy). Despite the significant impact of CLE on quality of life, therapeutic options remain inadequate.

Patients were recruited from 149 outpatient clinics in 12 countries across Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1) via an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and glycated haemoglobin, to subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2·4 mg, or semaglutide 1·0 mg, or visually matching placebo, once a week for 68 weeks, plus a lifestyle intervention. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and achievement of weight reduction of at least 5% at 68 weeks for semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo, assessed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03552757 and is closed to new participants.\nFINDINGS\nFrom June 4 to Nov 14, 2018, 1595 patients were screened, of whom 1210 were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2·4 mg (n=404), semaglutide 1·0 mg (n=403), or placebo (n=403) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated change in mean bodyweight from baseline to week 68 was -9·6% (SE 0·4) with semaglutide 2·4 mg vs -3·4% (0·4) with placebo. Estimated treatment difference for semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo was -6·2 percentage points (95% CI -7·3 to -5·2; p<0·0001). At week 68, more patients on semaglutide 2·4 mg than on placebo achieved weight reductions of at least 5% (267 [68·8%] of 388 vs 107 [28·5%] of 376; odds ratio 4·88, 95% CI 3·58 to 6·64; p<0·0001). Adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide 2·4 mg (in 353 [87·6%] of 403 patients) and 1·0 mg (329 [81·8%] of 402) than with placebo (309 [76·9%] of 402). Gastrointestinal adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate, were reported in 256 (63·5%) of 403 patients with semaglutide 2·4 mg, 231 (57·5%) of 402 with semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 138 (34·3%) of 402 with placebo.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 2·4 mg once a week achieved a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in bodyweight compared with placebo.\nFUNDING\nNovo Nordisk.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35441470\">Title: Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: The STEP 1 trial extension.\nAuthors: Wilding, John P H, Batterham, Rachel L, Davies, Melanie et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Diabetes, obesity & metabolism\nAbstract: AIM\nTo explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSTEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1961 adults with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with ≥ 1 weight-related co-morbidity) without diabetes to 68 weeks of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (including 16 weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued. An off-treatment extension assessed for a further year a representative subset of participants who had completed 68 weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.\nRESULTS\nExtension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOne year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33755728\">Title: Effect of Continued Weekly Subcutaneous Semaglutide vs Placebo on Weight Loss Maintenance in Adults With Overweight or Obesity: The STEP 4 Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Rubino, Domenica, Abrahamsson, Niclas, Davies, Melanie et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nThe effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRandomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥27 with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.\nINTERVENTIONS\nA total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).\nRESULTS\nAmong 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6-3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03548987.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36216945\">Title: Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial.\nAuthors: Garvey, W Timothy, Batterham, Rachel L, Bhatta, Meena et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature medicine\nAbstract: The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥5% at week 104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0) years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg m -2 and weight of 106.0 (22.0) kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 104 was -15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus -2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of -12.6 %-points (95% confidence interval, -15.3 to -9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥5% from baseline at week 104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104 weeks versus placebo.

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥27 in persons with ≥1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.\nRESULTS\nThe mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight.

At week 36, a total of 670 participants were randomized (1:1) to continue receiving tirzepatide (n = 335) or switch to placebo (n = 335) for 52 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary end point was the mean percent change in weight from week 36 (randomization) to week 88. Key secondary end points included the proportion of participants at week 88 who maintained at least 80% of the weight loss during the lead-in period.\nRESULTS\nParticipants (n = 670; mean age, 48 years; 473 [71%] women; mean weight, 107.3 kg) who completed the 36-week lead-in period experienced a mean weight reduction of 20.9%. The mean percent weight change from week 36 to week 88 was -5.5% with tirzepatide vs 14.0% with placebo (difference, -19.4% [95% CI, -21.2% to -17.7%]; P < .001). Overall, 300 participants (89.5%) receiving tirzepatide at 88 weeks maintained at least 80% of the weight loss during the lead-in period compared with 16.6% receiving placebo (P < .001). The overall mean weight reduction from week 0 to 88 was 25.3% for tirzepatide and 9.9% for placebo. The most common adverse events were mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal events, which occurred more commonly with tirzepatide vs placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nIn participants with obesity or overweight, withdrawing tirzepatide led to substantial regain of lost weight, whereas continued treatment maintained and augmented initial weight reduction.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04660643.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38819983\">Title: Tirzepatide for Weight Reduction in Chinese Adults With Obesity: The SURMOUNT-CN Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Zhao, Lin, Cheng, Zhifeng, Lu, Yibing et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nObesity has become a global public health concern and China has the largest number of affected people worldwide.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with tirzepatide for weight reduction in Chinese adults with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 29 centers in China from September 2021 to December 2022 included Chinese adults (aged ≥18 years) with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 28 or greater than or equal to 24 and at least 1 weight-related comorbidity, excluding diabetes.\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive once-weekly, subcutaneous 10-mg (n = 70) or 15-mg (n = 71) tirzepatide or placebo (n = 69), plus a lifestyle intervention, for 52 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nCo-primary end points were the percent change in body weight from baseline and weight reduction of at least 5% at week 52.

In an earlier analysis of the SURMOUNT-1 trial, tirzepatide was shown to provide substantial and sustained reductions in body weight in persons with obesity over a 72-week period. Here, we report the 3-year safety outcomes with tirzepatide and its efficacy in reducing weight and delaying progression to type 2 diabetes in persons with both obesity and prediabetes.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which 2539 participants with obesity, of whom 1032 also had prediabetes, were assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive tirzepatide at a once-weekly dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg or placebo. The current analysis involved the participants with both obesity and prediabetes, who received their assigned dose of tirzepatide or placebo for a total of 176 weeks, followed by a 17-week off-treatment period. The three key secondary end points, which were controlled for type I error, were the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 176 and onset of type 2 diabetes during the 176-week and 193-week periods.\nRESULTS\nAt 176 weeks, the mean percent change in body weight among the participants who received tirzepatide was -12.3% with the 5-mg dose, -18.7% with the 10-mg dose, and -19.7% with the 15-mg dose, as compared with -1.3% among those who received placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Fewer participants received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in the tirzepatide groups than in the placebo group (1.3% vs. 13.3%; hazard ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0 to 0.1; P<0.001). After 17 weeks off treatment or placebo, 2.4% of the participants who received tirzepatide and 13.7% of those who received placebo had type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.2; P<0.001). Other than coronavirus disease 2019, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, most of which were mild to moderate in severity and occurred primarily during the dose-escalation period in the first 20 weeks of the trial. No new safety signals were identified.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThree years of treatment with tirzepatide in persons with obesity and prediabetes resulted in substantial and sustained weight reduction and a markedly lower risk of progression to type 2 diabetes than that with placebo.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, versus placebo, for weight management in people living with obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\nThis phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in seven countries. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with a body-mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m 2 or higher and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) of 7-10% (53-86 mmol/mol) were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a computer-generated random sequence via a validated interactive web-response system, to receive either once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks. All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary endpoints were the percent change in bodyweight from baseline and bodyweight reduction of 5% or higher. The treatment-regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or initiation of antihyperglycaemic rescue therapy. Efficacy and safety endpoints were analysed with data from all randomly assigned participants (intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04657003.\nFINDINGS\nBetween March 29, 2021, and April 10, 2023, of 1514 adults assessed for eligibility, 938 (mean age 54·2 years [SD 10·6], 476 [51%] were female, 710 [76%] were White, and 561 [60%] were Hispanic or Latino) were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of tirzepatide 10 mg (n=312), tirzepatide 15 mg (n=311), or placebo (n=315). Baseline mean bodyweight was 100·7 kg (SD 21·1), BMI 36·1 kg/m 2 (SD 6·6), and HbA 1c 8·02% (SD 0·89; 64·1 mmol/mol [SD 9·7]). Least-squares mean change in bodyweight at week 72 with tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg was -12·8% (SE 0·6) and -14·7% (0·5), respectively, and -3·2% (0·5) with placebo, resulting in estimated treatment differences versus placebo of -9·6% percentage points (95% CI -11·1 to -8·1) with tirzepatide 10 mg and -11·6% percentage points (-13·0 to -10·1) with tirzepatide 15 mg (all p<0·0001). More participants treated with tirzepatide versus placebo met bodyweight reduction thresholds of 5% or higher (79-83% vs 32%). The most frequent adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting and were mostly mild to moderate in severity, with few events leading to treatment discontinuation (<5%). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (7%) participants overall and two deaths occurred in the tirzepatide 10 mg group, but deaths were not considered to be related to the study treatment by the investigator.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn this 72-week trial in adults living with obesity and type 2 diabetes, once-weekly tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg provided substantial and clinically meaningful reduction in bodyweight, with a safety profile that was similar to other incretin-based therapies for weight management.\nFUNDING\nEli Lilly and Company.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38912654\">Title: Tirzepatide for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Obesity.\nAuthors: Malhotra, Atul, Grunstein, Ronald R, Fietze, Ingo et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nObstructive sleep apnea is characterized by disordered breathing during sleep and is associated with major cardiovascular complications; excess adiposity is an etiologic risk factor. Tirzepatide may be a potential treatment.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted two phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials involving adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Participants who were not receiving treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) at baseline were enrolled in trial 1, and those who were receiving PAP therapy at baseline were enrolled in trial 2. The participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the number of apneas and hypopneas during an hour of sleep) from baseline. Key multiplicity-controlled secondary end points included the percent change in AHI and body weight and changes in hypoxic burden, patient-reported sleep impairment and disturbance, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration, and systolic blood pressure.\nRESULTS\nAt baseline, the mean AHI was 51.5 events per hour in trial 1 and 49.5 events per hour in trial 2, and the mean body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 39.1 and 38.7, respectively. In trial 1, the mean change in AHI at week 52 was -25.3 events per hour (95% confidence interval [CI], -29.3 to -21.2) with tirzepatide and -5.3 events per hour (95% CI, -9.4 to -1.1) with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -20.0 events per hour (95% CI, -25.8 to -14.2) (P<0.001). In trial 2, the mean change in AHI at week 52 was -29.3 events per hour (95% CI, -33.2 to -25.4) with tirzepatide and -5.5 events per hour (95% CI, -9.9 to -1.2) with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -23.8 events per hour (95% CI, -29.6 to -17.9) (P<0.001). Significant improvements in the measurements for all prespecified key secondary end points were observed with tirzepatide as compared with placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal in nature and mostly mild to moderate in severity.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong persons with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity, tirzepatide reduced the AHI, body weight, hypoxic burden, hsCRP concentration, and systolic blood pressure and improved sleep-related patient-reported outcomes.

The current analysis involved the participants with both obesity and prediabetes, who received their assigned dose of tirzepatide or placebo for a total of 176 weeks, followed by a 17-week off-treatment period. The three key secondary end points, which were controlled for type I error, were the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 176 and onset of type 2 diabetes during the 176-week and 193-week periods.\nRESULTS\nAt 176 weeks, the mean percent change in body weight among the participants who received tirzepatide was -12.3% with the 5-mg dose, -18.7% with the 10-mg dose, and -19.7% with the 15-mg dose, as compared with -1.3% among those who received placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Fewer participants received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in the tirzepatide groups than in the placebo group (1.3% vs. 13.3%; hazard ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0 to 0.1; P<0.001). After 17 weeks off treatment or placebo, 2.4% of the participants who received tirzepatide and 13.7% of those who received placebo had type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.2; P<0.001). Other than coronavirus disease 2019, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, most of which were mild to moderate in severity and occurred primarily during the dose-escalation period in the first 20 weeks of the trial. No new safety signals were identified.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThree years of treatment with tirzepatide in persons with obesity and prediabetes resulted in substantial and sustained weight reduction and a markedly lower risk of progression to type 2 diabetes than that with placebo.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, versus placebo, for weight management in people living with obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\nThis phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in seven countries. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with a body-mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m 2 or higher and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) of 7-10% (53-86 mmol/mol) were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a computer-generated random sequence via a validated interactive web-response system, to receive either once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks. All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary endpoints were the percent change in bodyweight from baseline and bodyweight reduction of 5% or higher. The treatment-regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or initiation of antihyperglycaemic rescue therapy. Efficacy and safety endpoints were analysed with data from all randomly assigned participants (intention-to-treat population).

Baseline mean bodyweight was 100·7 kg (SD 21·1), BMI 36·1 kg/m 2 (SD 6·6), and HbA 1c 8·02% (SD 0·89; 64·1 mmol/mol [SD 9·7]). Least-squares mean change in bodyweight at week 72 with tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg was -12·8% (SE 0·6) and -14·7% (0·5), respectively, and -3·2% (0·5) with placebo, resulting in estimated treatment differences versus placebo of -9·6% percentage points (95% CI -11·1 to -8·1) with tirzepatide 10 mg and -11·6% percentage points (-13·0 to -10·1) with tirzepatide 15 mg (all p<0·0001). More participants treated with tirzepatide versus placebo met bodyweight reduction thresholds of 5% or higher (79-83% vs 32%). The most frequent adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting and were mostly mild to moderate in severity, with few events leading to treatment discontinuation (<5%). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (7%) participants overall and two deaths occurred in the tirzepatide 10 mg group, but deaths were not considered to be related to the study treatment by the investigator.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn this 72-week trial in adults living with obesity and type 2 diabetes, once-weekly tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg provided substantial and clinically meaningful reduction in bodyweight, with a safety profile that was similar to other incretin-based therapies for weight management.\nFUNDING\nEli Lilly and Company.", "year": "2023", "venue": "Lancet (London, England)"}, {"paperId": "38912654", "title": "Tirzepatide for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Obesity.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nObstructive sleep apnea is characterized by disordered breathing during sleep and is associated with major cardiovascular complications; excess adiposity is an etiologic risk factor. Tirzepatide may be a potential treatment.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted two phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials involving adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. Participants who were not receiving treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) at baseline were enrolled in trial 1, and those who were receiving PAP therapy at baseline were enrolled in trial 2. The participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (10 mg or 15 mg) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the number of apneas and hypopneas during an hour of sleep) from baseline. Key multiplicity-controlled secondary end points included the percent change in AHI and body weight and changes in hypoxic burden, patient-reported sleep impairment and disturbance, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration, and systolic blood pressure.\nRESULTS\nAt baseline, the mean AHI was 51.5 events per hour in trial 1 and 49.5 events per hour in trial 2, and the mean body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 39.1 and 38.7, respectively.

Both trials aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged administration of nutritional lipids, specifically omega-3 fatty acids, on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in high-risk patients undergoing statin therapy. REDUCE-IT used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester with mineral oil as a control, while STRENGTH utilized a carboxylic acid formulation of both EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with corn oil as a control. Notably, REDUCE-IT demonstrated a reduction in MACE risk with EPA, whereas STRENGTH showed no such benefit with the combination of EPA and DHA. Despite extensive and insightful discussions following the publication of these trials, the underlying reasons for this discrepancy remain elusive. We posit that further investigation into resting heart rate (RHR), heart rate variability (HRV), and ethnic subgroup data-collected but not fully explored-is critical to unraveling the divergent outcomes of the REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH trials. These additional analyses could provide pivotal insights into the mechanisms driving the differential effects of omega-3 fatty acids in high-risk cardiovascular patients. Given that previous discussions have not fully addressed these potential variables, exploring them may illuminate unexplored pathways and offer a deeper understanding of the mechanistic and clinical roles of omega-3 s in cardiovascular health.

The STRENGTH trial (2020), which was similar in design to the REDUCE-IT trial but compared 4 g daily dose of combined OM3FA with a corn oil placebo, was terminated early due to futility.\nSUMMARY\nThis article provides a review of the data surrounding these trials and discusses the differing results of the two trials. There are key differences in the design of the two trials, the most notable is the use of mineral oil in the REDUCE-IT trial, which was potentially a nonneutral comparator. Additionally, both trials showed an increase in the incidence of atrial fibrillation. With the unclear benefit of OM3FA supplementation and possibility of harm, the current data suggest that the risk of routine use of OM3FA outweighs the possibility of reduction in risk of cardiovascular events.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">REDUCE-IT mineral oil LDL CRP</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 0 results.

Icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, lowers triglyceride levels, but data are needed to determine its effects on ischemic events.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with established cardiovascular disease or with diabetes and other risk factors, who had been receiving statin therapy and who had a fasting triglyceride level of 135 to 499 mg per deciliter (1.52 to 5.63 mmol per liter) and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 41 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.06 to 2.59 mmol per liter). The patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily (total daily dose, 4 g) or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.\nRESULTS\nA total of 8179 patients were enrolled (70.7% for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events) and were followed for a median of 4.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 17.2% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group, as compared with 22.0% of the patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.83; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point were 11.2% and 14.8% (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.83; P<0.001). The rates of additional ischemic end points, as assessed according to a prespecified hierarchical schema, were significantly lower in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group, including the rate of cardiovascular death (4.3% vs. 5.2%; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.98; P=0.03). A larger percentage of patients in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group were hospitalized for atrial fibrillation or flutter (3.1% vs. 2.1%, P=0.004). Serious bleeding events occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group and in 2.1% in the placebo group (P=0.06).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with elevated triglyceride levels despite the use of statins, the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, was significantly lower among those who received 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily than among those who received placebo.

Icosapent ethyl (IPE), a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, added to a statin was shown to reduce initial CV events by 25% and total CV events by 32% in the REDUCE-IT trial, with the mechanisms of benefit not yet fully explained. The EVAPORATE trial sought to determine whether IPE 4 g/day, as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy, would result in a greater change from baseline in plaque volume, measured by serial multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), than placebo in statin-treated patients.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nA total of 80 patients were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients had to have coronary atherosclerosis as documented by MDCT (one or more angiographic stenoses with ≥20% narrowing), be on statin therapy, and have persistently elevated triglyceride (TG) levels. Patients underwent an interim scan at 9 months and a final scan at 18 months with coronary computed tomographic angiography. The pre-specified primary endpoint was change in low-attenuation plaque (LAP) volume at 18 months between IPE and placebo groups. Baseline demographics, vitals, and laboratory results were not significantly different between the IPE and placebo groups; the median TG level was 259.1 ± 78.1 mg/dL. There was a significant reduction in the primary endpoint as IPE reduced LAP plaque volume by 17%, while in the placebo group LAP plaque volume more than doubled (+109%) (P = 0.0061). There were significant differences in rates of progression between IPE and placebo at study end involving other plaque volumes including fibrous, and fibrofatty (FF) plaque volumes which regressed in the IPE group and progressed in the placebo group (P < 0.01 for all). When further adjusted for age, sex, diabetes status, hypertension, and baseline TG, plaque volume changes between groups remained significantly different, P < 0.01. Only dense calcium did not show a significant difference between groups in multivariable modelling (P = 0.053).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIcosapent ethyl demonstrated significant regression of LAP volume on MDCT compared with placebo over 18 months. EVAPORATE provides important mechanistic data on plaque characteristics that may have relevance to the REDUCE-IT results and clinical use of IPE.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38252107\">Title: Icosapent ethyl following acute coronary syndrome: the REDUCE-IT trial.\nAuthors: Sayah, Neila, Bhatt, Deepak L, Miller, Michael et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: European heart journal\nAbstract: </snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39968782\">Title: Cardiovascular Outcomes With Icosapent Ethyl by Baseline Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol: A Secondary Analysis of the REDUCE-IT Randomized Trial.\nAuthors: Aggarwal, Rahul, Bhatt, Deepak L, Steg, Ph Gabriel et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Journal of the American Heart Association\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe efficacy of icosapent ethyl among patients with very well-controlled baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is unknown.\nMETHODS\nIn this post hoc analysis of the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial) randomized clinical trial, statin-treated patients with high cardiovascular risk, elevated triglycerides (135-499 mg/dL), and baseline LDL-C of 41 to 100 mg/dL were included. Patients were randomized to icosapent ethyl (2 g twice daily) or placebo and then post hoc stratified by baseline LDL-C (<55 mg/dL versus ≥55 mg/dL). The primary composite end point included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina.\nRESULTS\nAmong 8175 patients with baseline LDL-C data, 7117 (87.1%) had LDL-C ≥55 mg/dL and 1058 (12.9%) had LDL-C <55 mg/dL. In patients with LDL-C <55 mg/dL, the rate of the primary composite end point was lower in the icosapent ethyl group (16.2% versus 22.8%) than in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50-0.87]; absolute risk reduction, 6.6%; P =0.003). Among patients with LDL-C ≥55 mg/dL, a primary composite end point event occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the icosapent ethyl group (17.4% versus 21.9%) than in the placebo group (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69-0.85]; absolute risk reduction, 4.5%; P <0.0001). No significant interaction was observed between baseline LDL-C and treatment group ( P for interaction=0.40). Findings were consistent among secondary cardiovascular end points and in sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides and high cardiovascular risk, icosapent ethyl reduced the rate of cardiovascular end points irrespective of baseline LDL-C, including among eligible patients with optimal LDL-C control.\nREGISTRATION\nURL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01492361.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39084839\">Title: Therapy for Hyperlipidemia.\nAuthors: Wright, Jennifer, Subramanian, Savitha | Year: 2024 | Journal: The Medical clinics of North America\nAbstract: Significant advances in atherosclerotic cardiovascular (ASCVD) risk stratification and treatment have occurred over the past 10 years.

The STRENGTH trial (2020), which was similar in design to the REDUCE-IT trial but compared 4 g daily dose of combined OM3FA with a corn oil placebo, was terminated early due to futility.\nSUMMARY\nThis article provides a review of the data surrounding these trials and discusses the differing results of the two trials. There are key differences in the design of the two trials, the most notable is the use of mineral oil in the REDUCE-IT trial, which was potentially a nonneutral comparator. Additionally, both trials showed an increase in the incidence of atrial fibrillation.

Icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, lowers triglyceride levels, but data are needed to determine its effects on ischemic events.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with established cardiovascular disease or with diabetes and other risk factors, who had been receiving statin therapy and who had a fasting triglyceride level of 135 to 499 mg per deciliter (1.52 to 5.63 mmol per liter) and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 41 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.06 to 2.59 mmol per liter). The patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily (total daily dose, 4 g) or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.\nRESULTS\nA total of 8179 patients were enrolled (70.7% for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events) and were followed for a median of 4.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 17.2% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group, as compared with 22.0% of the patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.83; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of the key secondary end point were 11.2% and 14.8% (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.83; P<0.001). The rates of additional ischemic end points, as assessed according to a prespecified hierarchical schema, were significantly lower in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group, including the rate of cardiovascular death (4.3% vs. 5.2%; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.98; P=0.03). A larger percentage of patients in the icosapent ethyl group than in the placebo group were hospitalized for atrial fibrillation or flutter (3.1% vs. 2.1%, P=0.004). Serious bleeding events occurred in 2.7% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group and in 2.1% in the placebo group (P=0.06).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with elevated triglyceride levels despite the use of statins, the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, was significantly lower among those who received 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily than among those who received placebo.

Presence of ACPA and RF as well as rising CRP-levels in some patients years before onset of clinical symptoms indicate that relevant immune responses for RA development are initiated very early. ACPA are highly specific for RA, whereas RF can also be found among healthy (elderly) individuals and patients with other autoimmune diseases or infection. The most important genetic risk factor for RA development, the shared epitope alleles, resides in the MHC class II region. Shared epitope alleles, however, only predispose to the development of ACPA-positive RA. Smoking is thus far the most important environmental risk factor associated with the development of RA. Studies on synovitis have shown the importance not only of adaptive but also of innate immune responses. In summary of the various results from immunological changes in blood and synovial tissue, the extension of the immune response from a diffuse myeloid to a lympho-myeloid inflammation appears to be associated with a more successful therapeutic response to biologics. With respect to advances in synovitis research, new targets for treatment against pathological subsets of immune cells or fibroblasts are already on the horizon. However, alternative strategies involving the microbiome may play an important role as well and research in this field is growing rapidly.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33346115\">Title: Beyond the joints, the extra-articular manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis.\nAuthors: Conforti, Alessandro, Di Cola, Ilenia, Pavlych, Viktoriya et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Autoimmunity reviews\nAbstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease typically affecting the joints, but the systemic inflammatory process may involve other tissues and organs. Many extra-articular manifestations are recognized, which are related to worse long outcomes. Rheumatoid nodules are the most common extra-articular feature, found in about 30% of patients. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome and pulmonary manifestations are observed in almost 10% of patients, also in the early disease. Active RA with high disease activity has been associated with an increased risk of such features. Male gender, smoking habit, severe joint disease, worse function, high pro-inflammatory markers levels, high titer of rheumatoid factor, and HLA-related shared epitope have been reported as clinical predictors of occurrence of these rheumatoid complications. In addition, there is a little evidence deriving from randomized controlled trials in this field, thus the therapeutic strategy is mainly empiric and based on small case series and retrospective studies. However, considering that these extra-articular manifestations are usually related to the more active and severe RA, an aggressive therapeutic strategy is usually employed in view of the poor outcomes of these patients. The extra-articular features of RA remain, despite the improvement of joint damage, a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, since these are associated with a poor prognosis and need to be early recognized and promptly managed.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29221595\">Title: Genetic and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis.\nAuthors: Deane, Kevin D, Demoruelle, M Kristen, Kelmenson, Lindsay B et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: Best practice & research. Clinical rheumatology\nAbstract: Multiple genetic and environmental factors have been associated with an increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Of these, the strongest associations have been seen with female sex, a family history of RA, the genetic factor the \"shared epitope,\" and exposure to tobacco smoke. There is also renewed interest in mucosal inflammation and microbial factors as contributors to the development of RA. However, the identification of a \"preclinical\" period of RA that can be defined as local or systemic autoimmunity as measured by autoantibodies and other biomarkers prior to the development of clinically apparent synovitis suggests that the risk factors for RA are acting long prior to first clinical evidence of IA. As such, a major challenge to the field will be to investigate the full spectrum of the development of RA, from initiation and propagation of autoimmunity during preclinical RA and transition to clinically apparent synovitis and classifiable RA, to determine which genetic and environmental factors are important at each stage of disease development. Understanding the exact role and timing of action of risk factors for RA is especially important given the advent of prevention trials in RA, and the hope that a full understanding of genetic and environmental factors in RA could lead to effective preventive interventions.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37468085\">Title: Rheumatoid vasculitis in 2023: Changes and challenges since the biologics era.\nAuthors: Mertz, Philippe, Wollenschlaeger, Clara, Chasset, François et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Autoimmunity reviews\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nSignificant changes in the epidemiology and natural history of rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) have occurred with the introduction of biological therapies such as TNF inhibitors (TNFi) and rituximab.\nPURPOSE\nThis scoping review aims to address the key current challenges and propose updated criteria for RV. This will aid future descriptive observational studies and prospective therapeutic trials.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe MEDLINE database was searched for eligible articles from inception through December 2022. Articles were selected based on language and publication date after 1998, corresponding to the approval of the first TNFi in rheumatic diseases.\nRESULTS\nSixty articles were included in the review. The mean incidence of RV has decreased since the approval of biologic therapies in RA, from 9.1 (95% CI: 6.8-12.0) per million between 1988 and 2000 to 3.9 (95% CI: 2.3-6.2) between 2001 and 2010, probably due to significant improvement in RA severity and a decrease in smoking habits. Factors associated with an increased risk of RV include smoking at RA diagnosis, longer disease duration, severe RA, immunopositivity, and male gender (regardless of age). Homozygosity for the HLA-DRB104 shared epitope is linked to RV, while the presence of HLA-C3 is a significant predictor of vasculitis in patients without HLA-DRB104. Cutaneous (65-88%), neurologic (35-63%), and cardiac (33%) manifestations are common in RV, often associated with constitutional symptoms (70%). Histologic findings range from small vessel vasculitis to medium-sized necrotizing arteritis, but definite evidence of vasculitis is not required in the 1984 Scott and Bacon diagnostic criteria. Existing data on RV treatment are retrospective, and no formal published guidelines are currently available.\nCONCLUSION\nThe understanding of RV pathogenesis has improved since its initial diagnostic criteria, with a wider range of clinical manifestations identified. However, a validated and updated criteria that incorporates these advances is currently lacking, impeding the development of descriptive observational studies and prospective therapeutic trials.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33746022\">Title: The pre-clinical phase of rheumatoid arthritis: From risk factors to prevention of arthritis.\nAuthors: Petrovská, Nora, Prajzlerová, Klára, Vencovský, Jiří et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Autoimmunity reviews\nAbstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease considered as a multistep process spanning from the interaction of genetic (e.g., shared epitope or non-HLA loci), environmental and behavioral risk factors (e.g., smoking) leading to breaking immune tolerance and autoimmune processes such as the production of autoantibodies (e.g., antibodies against citrullinated proteins ACPA or rheumatoid factors, RF), development of the first symptoms without clinical arthritis, and, finally, the manifestation of arthritis. Despite the typical joint involvement in established RA, the pathogenesis of the disease likely begins far from joint structures: in the lungs or periodontium in association with citrullination, intestinal microbiome, or adipose tissue, which supports normal findings in synovial tissue in ACPA+ patients with arthralgia. The presence of ACPA is detectable even years before the first manifestation of RA. The pre-clinical phase of RA is the period preceding clinically apparent RA with ACPA contributing to the symptoms without subclinical inflammation. While the combination of ACPA and RF increases the risk of progression to RA by up to 10 times, increasing numbers of novel autoantibodies are to be investigated to contribute to the increased risk and pathogenesis of RA. With growing knowledge about the course of RA, new aspiration emerges to cure and even prevent RA, shifting the \"window of opportunity\" to the pre-clinical phases of RA. The clinical definition of individuals at risk of developing RA (clinically suspect arthralgia, CSA) makes it possible to unify these at-risk individuals' clinical characteristics for \"preventive\" treatment in ongoing clinical trials using mostly biological or conventional synthetic disease-modifying drugs. However, the combination of symptoms, laboratory, and imaging biomarkers may be the best approach to select the correct target at-risk population. The current review aims to explore different phases of RA and discuss the potential of (non)pharmacological intervention aiming to prevent RA.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">15059859 rheumatoid</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 175523 results.

Smoking is the main environmental risk. In industrialised countries, rheumatoid arthritis affects 0·5-1·0% of adults, with 5-50 per 100 000 new cases annually. The disorder is most typical in women and elderly people. Uncontrolled active rheumatoid arthritis causes joint damage, disability, decreased quality of life, and cardiovascular and other comorbidities. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the key therapeutic agents, reduce synovitis and systemic inflammation and improve function. The leading DMARD is methotrexate, which can be combined with other drugs of this type. Biological agents are used when arthritis is uncontrolled or toxic effects arise with DMARDs. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were the first biological agents, followed by abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab. Infections and high costs restrict prescription of biological agents. Long-term remission induced by intensive, short-term treatment selected by biomarker profiles is the ultimate goal.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29417950\">Title: Rheumatoid arthritis.\nAuthors:  | Year: 2018 | Journal: Nature reviews.

The skin is frequently involved mainly in the most severe forms of the disease. Rheumatoid nodules, accelerated rheumatoid nodulosis, rheumatoid nodulosis, Felty syndrome, rheumatoid vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatosis, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, and palisaded neutrophilic granulomatous dermatitis are reviewed both clinically and histologically. Moreover, cutaneous reactions related to treatments of rheumatoid arthritis, in particular to biologic agents, are described. Early recognition of these entities through a clinical and histological correlation permit to optimize the management of patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"26143419\">Title: Rheumatoid Nodules.\nAuthors: Tilstra, Jeremy S, Lienesch, Douglas W | Year: 2015 | Journal: Dermatologic clinics\nAbstract: Rheumatoid nodules are a common manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. These lesions are often easily identified based on typical diagnostic features and characteristic locations. When biopsied, nodules have a characteristic histologic appearance. Uncommonly, rheumatoid nodules can occur in systemic locations. There is no evidence that systemic therapy treats underlying rheumatoid nodules. Paradoxically, methotrexate and possibly tumor necrosis factor inhibitors can increase nodule development. Treatment of rheumatoid nodules is often not necessary, unless patients are experiencing pain or there is interference of mechanical function.

We studied a potential gene-environment interaction between SE genes and smoking in the etiology of the 2 major subgroups of RA: rheumatoid factor (RF)-seropositive and RF-seronegative disease.\nMETHODS\nA population-based case-control study involving incident cases of RF-seropositive and RF-seronegative RA (858 cases and 1,048 controls) was performed in Sweden. Cases and controls were classified according to their cigarette smoking status and HLA-DRB1 genotypes. The relative risk of developing RA was calculated for different gene/smoking combinations and was compared with the relative risk in never smokers without SE genes.\nRESULTS\nThe relative risk of RF-seropositive RA was 2.8 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.6-4.8) in never smokers with SE genes, 2.4 (95% CI 1.3-4.6) in current smokers without SE genes, and 7.5 (95% CI 4.2-13.1) in current smokers with SE genes. Smokers carrying double SE genes displayed a relative risk of RF-seropositive RA of 15.7 (95% CI 7.2-34.2). The interaction between smoking and SE genes was significant, as measured by the attributable proportion due to interaction, which was 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.7) for smoking and any SE, and 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9) for smoking and a double SE. Neither smoking nor SE genes nor the combination of these factors increased the risk of developing RF-seronegative RA.\nCONCLUSION\nThe disease risk of RF-seropositive RA associated with one of the classic genetic risk factors for immune-mediated diseases (the SE of HLA-DR) is strongly influenced by the presence of an environmental factor (smoking) in the population at risk.</snippet>\n</tool_output>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15059859/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15059859/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"Skip to main page content \\n![U.S. flag](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/coreutils/uswds/img/favicons/favicon-57.png)\\nAn official website of the United States government\\nHere's how you know\\n![Dot gov](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/coreutils/uswds/img/icon-dot-gov.svg)\\n**The .gov means it’s official.**   \\nFederal government websites often end in .gov or .mil.

Presence of ACPA and RF as well as rising CRP-levels in some patients years before onset of clinical symptoms indicate that relevant immune responses for RA development are initiated very early. ACPA are highly specific for RA, whereas RF can also be found among healthy (elderly) individuals and patients with other autoimmune diseases or infection. The most important genetic risk factor for RA development, the shared epitope alleles, resides in the MHC class II region. Shared epitope alleles, however, only predispose to the development of ACPA-positive RA. Smoking is thus far the most important environmental risk factor associated with the development of RA. Studies on synovitis have shown the importance not only of adaptive but also of innate immune responses. In summary of the various results from immunological changes in blood and synovial tissue, the extension of the immune response from a diffuse myeloid to a lympho-myeloid inflammation appears to be associated with a more successful therapeutic response to biologics. With respect to advances in synovitis research, new targets for treatment against pathological subsets of immune cells or fibroblasts are already on the horizon.

Secondary Sjögren's syndrome and pulmonary manifestations are observed in almost 10% of patients, also in the early disease. Active RA with high disease activity has been associated with an increased risk of such features. Male gender, smoking habit, severe joint disease, worse function, high pro-inflammatory markers levels, high titer of rheumatoid factor, and HLA-related shared epitope have been reported as clinical predictors of occurrence of these rheumatoid complications. In addition, there is a little evidence deriving from randomized controlled trials in this field, thus the therapeutic strategy is mainly empiric and based on small case series and retrospective studies. However, considering that these extra-articular manifestations are usually related to the more active and severe RA, an aggressive therapeutic strategy is usually employed in view of the poor outcomes of these patients.

Of these, the strongest associations have been seen with female sex, a family history of RA, the genetic factor the \"shared epitope,\" and exposure to tobacco smoke. There is also renewed interest in mucosal inflammation and microbial factors as contributors to the development of RA. However, the identification of a \"preclinical\" period of RA that can be defined as local or systemic autoimmunity as measured by autoantibodies and other biomarkers prior to the development of clinically apparent synovitis suggests that the risk factors for RA are acting long prior to first clinical evidence of IA. As such, a major challenge to the field will be to investigate the full spectrum of the development of RA, from initiation and propagation of autoimmunity during preclinical RA and transition to clinically apparent synovitis and classifiable RA, to determine which genetic and environmental factors are important at each stage of disease development. Understanding the exact role and timing of action of risk factors for RA is especially important given the advent of prevention trials in RA, and the hope that a full understanding of genetic and environmental factors in RA could lead to effective preventive interventions.", "year": "2017", "venue": "Best practice & research.

This will aid future descriptive observational studies and prospective therapeutic trials.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe MEDLINE database was searched for eligible articles from inception through December 2022. Articles were selected based on language and publication date after 1998, corresponding to the approval of the first TNFi in rheumatic diseases.\nRESULTS\nSixty articles were included in the review. The mean incidence of RV has decreased since the approval of biologic therapies in RA, from 9.1 (95% CI: 6.8-12.0) per million between 1988 and 2000 to 3.9 (95% CI: 2.3-6.2) between 2001 and 2010, probably due to significant improvement in RA severity and a decrease in smoking habits. Factors associated with an increased risk of RV include smoking at RA diagnosis, longer disease duration, severe RA, immunopositivity, and male gender (regardless of age). Homozygosity for the HLA-DRB104 shared epitope is linked to RV, while the presence of HLA-C3 is a significant predictor of vasculitis in patients without HLA-DRB104. Cutaneous (65-88%), neurologic (35-63%), and cardiac (33%) manifestations are common in RV, often associated with constitutional symptoms (70%). Histologic findings range from small vessel vasculitis to medium-sized necrotizing arteritis, but definite evidence of vasculitis is not required in the 1984 Scott and Bacon diagnostic criteria. Existing data on RV treatment are retrospective, and no formal published guidelines are currently available.\nCONCLUSION\nThe understanding of RV pathogenesis has improved since its initial diagnostic criteria, with a wider range of clinical manifestations identified.

Despite the typical joint involvement in established RA, the pathogenesis of the disease likely begins far from joint structures: in the lungs or periodontium in association with citrullination, intestinal microbiome, or adipose tissue, which supports normal findings in synovial tissue in ACPA+ patients with arthralgia. The presence of ACPA is detectable even years before the first manifestation of RA. The pre-clinical phase of RA is the period preceding clinically apparent RA with ACPA contributing to the symptoms without subclinical inflammation. While the combination of ACPA and RF increases the risk of progression to RA by up to 10 times, increasing numbers of novel autoantibodies are to be investigated to contribute to the increased risk and pathogenesis of RA. With growing knowledge about the course of RA, new aspiration emerges to cure and even prevent RA, shifting the \"window of opportunity\" to the pre-clinical phases of RA. The clinical definition of individuals at risk of developing RA (clinically suspect arthralgia, CSA) makes it possible to unify these at-risk individuals' clinical characteristics for \"preventive\" treatment in ongoing clinical trials using mostly biological or conventional synthetic disease-modifying drugs.

The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown.\nMETHODS\nIn this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H-dMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil-based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival.\nRESULTS\nAt the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P = 0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died.

An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1% in the chemotherapy group.

Oncology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nPembrolizumab has shown improved progression-free survival versus chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. However, the treatment's effect on overall survival in this cohort of patients was unknown. Here, we present the final overall survival analysis of the KEYNOTE-177 study.\nMETHODS\nThis randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 193 academic medical centres and hospitals in 23 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously untreated microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four using an interactive voice response system or integrated web response system to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks or to the investigator's choice of intravenous mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 on day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 on day 1, and fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 bolus on day 1 followed by a continuous infusion of 1200 mg/m 2 per day for 2 days on days 1-2) or intravenous FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 on day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 on day 1, and fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 bolus on day 1 followed by a continuous infusion of 1200 mg/m 2 per day for 2 days on days 1-2), every 2 weeks with or without intravenous bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or intravenous weekly cetuximab (first dose 400 mg/m 2 , then 250 mg/m 2 for every subsequent dose). Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab for up to 35 treatment cycles after progression. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. KEYNOTE-177 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02563002, and is no longer enrolling patients.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Feb 11, 2016, and Feb 19, 2018, 852 patients were screened, of whom 307 (36%) were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n=153) or chemotherapy (n=154). 93 (60%) patients crossed over from chemotherapy to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (56 patients to on-study pembrolizumab and 37 patients to off-study therapy). At final analysis (median follow-up of 44·5 months [IQR 39·7-49·8]), median overall survival was not reached (NR; 95% CI 49·2-NR) with pembrolizumab vs 36·7 months (27·6-NR) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0·74; 95% CI 0·53-1·03; p=0·036). Superiority of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for overall survival was not demonstrated because the prespecified α of 0·025 needed for statistical significance was not achieved. At this updated analysis, median progression-free survival was 16·5 months (95% CI 5·4-38·1) with pembrolizumab versus 8·2 months (6·1-10·2) with chemotherapy (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·45-0·79). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 33 (22%) of 153 patients in the pembrolizumab group versus 95 (66%) of 143 patients in the chemotherapy group. Common adverse events of grade 3 or worse that were attributed to pembrolizumab were increased alanine aminotransferase, colitis, diarrhoea, and fatigue in three (2%) patients each, and those attributed to chemotherapy were decreased neutrophil count (in 24 [17%] patients), neutropenia (22 [15%]), diarrhoea (14 [10%]), and fatigue (13 [9%]). Serious adverse events attributed to study treatment occurred in 25 (16%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 41 (29%) patients in the chemotherapy group. No deaths attributed to pembrolizumab occurred; one death due to intestinal perforation was attributed to chemotherapy.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn this updated analysis, although pembrolizumab continued to show durable antitumour activity and fewer treatment-related adverse events compared with chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment groups. These findings support pembrolizumab as an efficacious first-line therapy in patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.\nFUNDING\nMSD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39631622\">Title: Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer: 5-year follow-up from the randomized phase III KEYNOTE-177 study.\nAuthors: André, T, Shiu, K-K, Kim, T W et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nResults from the phase III KEYNOTE-177 study established pembrolizumab as a new first-line standard of care for microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Previous results from KEYNOTE-177 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab/cetuximab in MSI-H/dMMR mCRC. Results after >5 years of follow-up are reported.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nAdults with untreated MSI-H/dMMR mCRC were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or chemotherapy. Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab after centrally confirmed progressive disease. Dual primary endpoints were PFS per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included duration of response and safety.\nRESULTS\nAt data cut-off (17 July 2023), median follow-up was 73.3 months (range, 64.9-89.2 months). Overall, 307 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab (n = 153) or chemotherapy (n = 154). Fifty-seven (37.0%) patients assigned to chemotherapy crossed over to pembrolizumab per protocol; 39 (25.3%) received a programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-(L)1] inhibitor off protocol (effective crossover rate, 62%). Median OS was 77.5 months with pembrolizumab versus 36.7 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.99); 5-year OS rates were 54.8% versus 44.2%. Median PFS was 16.5 months with pembrolizumab and 8.2 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.79).

We hypothesized that tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate.\nRESULTS\nThe immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]). Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67% [4 of 6 patients]). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.

Given the compelling long-term durable remission, two programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)-blocking antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab (with or without Ipilimumab), have been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is mismatch-repair-deficient and microsatellite instability-high (dMMR-MSI-H). Practice-changing results of several randomized controlled trials to move immunotherapy into the first-line treatment for MSI-H metastasis cancer and earlier stage were reported successively in the past 2 years. Besides, new intriguing advances to expand the efficacy of immunotherapy to mCRC that is mismatch-repair-proficient and low microsatellite instability (pMMR-MSI-L) demonstrated the potential benefits for the vast majority of mCRC cases. Great attention is also paid to the advances in cancer vaccines and adoptive cell therapy (ACT). In this review, we summarize the above progresses, and also highlight the current predictive biomarkers of responsiveness in immunotherapy with broad clinical utility.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n**Early-phase (Le et al., 2015; mostly previously treated/progressive metastatic disease; small MSI-H/dMMR CRC cohort):**  \n- **Objective response rate (ORR):** **40%** (4/10) using *immune-related* response criteria in the dMMR CRC cohort. <cite id=\"26028255\">Le DT et al., 2015 (phase 2) reported an immune-related ORR of 40% in dMMR CRC.</cite>  \n- **Progression-free survival (PFS):** **Median PFS not reached** in dMMR CRC at the time of reporting; instead they emphasized a **20-week immune-related PFS rate of 78%** (7/9). <cite id=\"26028255\">Le DT et al., 2015 reported median PFS not reached for dMMR CRC and a 20-week immune-related PFS rate of 78%.</cite>\n\n**Phase III (KEYNOTE-177, 2020; first-line metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC; larger randomized setting):**  \n- **ORR:** **43.8%** with pembrolizumab (RECIST v1.1). <cite id=\"33264544\">André T et al., KEYNOTE-177 (NEJM 2020) reported ORR 43.8% with pembrolizumab.</cite>  \n- **PFS:** **Median PFS 16.5 months** with pembrolizumab. <cite id=\"33264544\">André T et al., KEYNOTE-177 reported median PFS 16.5 months for pembrolizumab.</cite>\n\n**How they differ:** ORR is **similar (~40–44%)** between the early-phase signal-finding study and the phase III trial, but PFS reporting differs: the early-phase study had **median PFS not reached** (and highlighted a high **20-week PFS rate**), whereas KEYNOTE-177 provides a definitive **median PFS of 16.5 months** in a first-line, randomized phase III context. <cite id=\"26028255\">Le DT et al., 2015.</cite> <cite id=\"33264544\">André T et al., 2020.</cite>\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26028255/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26028255/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency \\nN Engl J Med. 2015 Jun 25;372(26):2509-20. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1500596.

Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.

We evaluated the association of ELF and PIIINP with fibrosis stages at baseline and end of treatment (EOT) with vitamin E or pioglitazone in the PIVENS trial (Pioglitazone vs. Vitamin E vs. Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients With NASH) and characterized ELF and PIIINP changes and their associations with changes in the histological endpoints. ELF and PIIINP were measured at baseline and weeks 16, 48, and 96 on sera from 243 PIVENS participants. Baseline and EOT ELF were significantly associated with fibrosis stage ( P < 0.001). The area under the curve for ELF's detection of clinically significant and advanced fibrosis in baseline biopsies was 0.74 and 0.79, respectively ( P < 0.001). There was a significant drop in ELF score at weeks 48 and 96 in patients who achieved the NAFLD activity score (NAS)-based primary end point ( P = 0.007) but not in those who experienced NASH resolution ( P = 0.24) or fibrosis improvement ( P = 0.50). Change in PIIINP was significantly associated with NASH resolution and improvement in NAS-based histological endpoint and fibrosis ( P < 0.05 for all). Over the study period, both ELF and PIIINP significantly decreased with vitamin E ( P < 0.05), but only PIIINP decreased with pioglitazone ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: ELF is significantly associated with clinically significant and advanced fibrosis in patients with NASH, but its longitudinal changes were not associated with improvement in fibrosis or NASH resolution. PIIINP, one of its components, appears promising for identifying longitudinal histologic changes in patients with NASH and is worthy of further investigation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"18804555\">Title: Pioglitazone versus vitamin E versus placebo for the treatment of non-diabetic patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: PIVENS trial design.\nAuthors: Chalasani, Naga P, Sanyal, Arun J, Kowdley, Kris V et al. | Year: 2009 | Journal: Contemporary clinical trials\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease associated with obesity and diabetes. NASH is a progressive disorder that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress are thought to play important roles in its pathogenesis. There is no definitive treatment for NASH.\nOBJECTIVES\nPIVENS is conducted to test the hypotheses that treatment with pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizer, or vitamin E, a naturally available antioxidant, will lead to improvement in hepatic histology in non-diabetic adults with biopsy proven NASH.\nDESIGN\nPIVENS is a randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with pioglitazone or vitamin E improves hepatic histology in non-diabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo. Before and post-treatment liver biopsies are read centrally in a masked fashion for an assessment of steatohepatitis and a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) consisting of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning. The primary outcome measure is defined as either an improvement in NAS by 2 or more in at least two NAS features, or a post-treatment NAS of 3 or less, and improvement in hepatocyte ballooning by 1 or more, and no worsening of fibrosis.\nMETHODS\nPIVENS enrollment started in January 2005 and ended in January 2007 with 247 patients randomized to receive either pioglitazone (30 mg q.d.), vitamin E (800 IU q.d.), or placebo for 96 weeks. Participants will be followed for an additional 24 weeks after stopping the treatment. The study protocol incorporates the use of several validated questionnaires and specimen banking. This protocol was approved by all participating center Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) which was established for monitoring the accumulated interim data as the trial progresses to ensure patient safety and to review efficacy as well as the quality of data collection and overall study management.

We conducted a study to examine the changes in adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR) during the PIVENS trial and its relationship to histological endpoints. Adipo-IR (fasting nonesterified fatty acids [NEFAs] × fasting insulin) was calculated at baseline and after 16 and 96 weeks of therapy. Compared to placebo, the baseline Adipo-IR was not different in either the vitamin E group (P = 0.34) or the pioglitazone group (P = 0.29). Baseline Adipo-IR was significantly associated with fibrosis score (P = 0.02), but not with other histological features or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS). After 16 weeks, compared to placebo, the pioglitazone group had a significant reduction in Adipo-IR (-15.7 versus -1.91; P = 0.02), but this effect did not persist at 96 weeks (-3.25 versus -4.28; P = 0.31). Compared to placebo, Adipo-IR in the vitamin E group did not change significantly either after 16 weeks (P = 0.70) or after 96 weeks (P = 0.85). Change in Adipo-IR at week 16 was not associated with changes in any histological parameters at week 96, but improvement in Adipo-IR at week 96 was significantly associated with improvement in ballooning (P = 0.03), fibrosis (P = 0.004), and NAS (P = 0.01).\nCONCLUSION\nVitamin E improved liver histology independent of changes in Adipo-IR, and pioglitazone treatment acutely improved Adipo-IR, but this was not sustained. Changes in Adipo-IR were associated with changes in liver histology, including fibrosis.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38788522\">Title: FIB-4 as a screening and disease monitoring method in pre-fibrotic stages of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD).\nAuthors: Albert, Stewart G, Wood, Emily M | Year: 2024 | Journal: Journal of diabetes and its complications\nAbstract: AIMS\nGuidelines emphasize screening high-risk patients for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) with a calculated FIB-4 score for therapy to reverse fibrosis. We aimed to determine whether FIB-4 can effectively screen and monitor changes in steatohepatitis (MASH).\nMETHODS\nData were retrieved from the NIDDK-CR R4R central repository, of the CRN/PIVENS (pioglitazone vs vitamin E vs placebo) trial of adult patients without diabetes mellitus and with MASLD.\nRESULTS\n220 patients with MASLD had alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and platelet count, to calculate FIB-4, and repeat liver biopsies for histological MASLD activity scores (NAS). Compared to NAS score of 2, Fib-4 was higher at NAS 5) (p = 0.03), and NAS score of 6 (p = 0.02). FIB-4 correlated with cellular ballooning (r = 0.309, p < 0.001). Levels of ALT (ANOVA, p = 0.016) and AST (ANOVA p = 0.0008) were associated with NAS. NAS improved with pioglitazone by 39 %, p < 0.001 and with vitamin E by 36 %, p < 0.001. Pioglitazone and vitamin E both improved histological sub-scores for steatosis, and inflammation, without statistical changes in fibrosis grade. Changes in FIB-4 correlated with changes in NAS (r = 0.237, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this post hoc analysis, changes in FIB-4 were associated with changes of steatohepatitis.

This study sought associations between observed improvements in fibrosis with improvement in specific histologic features, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) ≥2, diagnostic category, and primary histologically based outcomes of two adult NASH treatment trials. The primary outcome for the study was fibrosis improvement from baseline to end of treatment, defined as a 1-point or more improvement in fibrosis stage. This is a retrospective analysis of biopsy data collected from the NASH Clinical Research Network Pathology Committee of Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with NASH Trial (PIVENS) and Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment Trial (FLINT) baseline and final biopsies. Treatment group-adjusted univariable and multivariable logistic regression models related improvement in fibrosis to improvements in other histologic variables, resolution of steatohepatitis, and improvement in the NAS ≥2. In PIVENS 221 subjects had baseline and 96-week biopsies, and in FLINT 200 subjects had baseline and 72-week biopsies.

The NIDDK-sponsored PIVENS trial (NCT00063622) showed that vitamin E (VitE) improved NASH. We investigated whether VitE treatment and improvement in NASH were associated with changes in Hh pathway activity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on both pre- and posttreatment liver biopsies of 59 PIVENS patients randomized to VitE (n = 30) or placebo (n = 29). Sonic Hh (Shh) ligand-producing cells and Shh-responsive cells were quantified. The latter was accomplished by triple IHC for gli2+ (marker of Hh signaling), sox-9 (progenitor marker), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; myofibroblast marker). Ballooned hepatocytes were quantified by keratin 8/18 and ubiquitin (K8/18/Ub) staining. IHC results were correlated with primary clinical and histologic PIVENS data. Pretreatment clinical, histologic, and IHC parameters did not differ significantly in the two treatment groups. Regardless of treatment arm, the number of Shh+ hepatocytes correlated with K8/18/Ub foci (r(2) = 0.47, P < 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (r(2) = 0.15, P = 0.002). Treatment-related changes in the numbers of Shh+ hepatocytes correlated with changes in serum AST (partial r(2) = 0.75, P < 0.0001), hepatocyte ballooning (P = 0.004), the ductular reaction (i.e., numbers of gli2+/sox9+ cells; P = 0.03 and α-SMA+ cells; P = 0.10), and fibrosis stage (P = 0.02). Treatment response was associated with a greater decrease in Shh+ hepatocytes than nonresponse (P = 0.007). The VitE group demonstrated a greater reduction in K8/18/Ub+ foci (P < 0.08) and Shh+ hepatocytes (P < 0.05) than the placebo group, effects that became more significant after correction for baseline differences and multiple linear regression analysis.\nCONCLUSION\nDuring PIVENS, treatment response correlated with loss of Shh+ hepatocytes and improvement in Hh-regulated processes that promote NASH progression.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30549292\">Title: Improvements in Histologic Features and Diagnosis Associated With Improvement in Fibrosis in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Results From the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network Treatment Trials.\nAuthors: Brunt, Elizabeth M, Kleiner, David E, Wilson, Laura A et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)\nAbstract: Hepatocellular injury and inflammation are believed to be the primary drivers of fibrogenesis that ultimately lead to cirrhosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

There was a significant drop in ELF score at weeks 48 and 96 in patients who achieved the NAFLD activity score (NAS)-based primary end point ( P = 0.007) but not in those who experienced NASH resolution ( P = 0.24) or fibrosis improvement ( P = 0.50). Change in PIIINP was significantly associated with NASH resolution and improvement in NAS-based histological endpoint and fibrosis ( P < 0.05 for all). Over the study period, both ELF and PIIINP significantly decreased with vitamin E ( P < 0.05), but only PIIINP decreased with pioglitazone ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: ELF is significantly associated with clinically significant and advanced fibrosis in patients with NASH, but its longitudinal changes were not associated with improvement in fibrosis or NASH resolution. PIIINP, one of its components, appears promising for identifying longitudinal histologic changes in patients with NASH and is worthy of further investigation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29095942\">Title: Serum high mobility group box 1 protein levels are not associated with either histological severity or treatment response in children and adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAuthors: Yates, Katherine P, Deppe, Ross, Comerford, Megan et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: PloS one\nAbstract: AIM\nSerum high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a proinflammatory molecule that could potentially serve as a biomarker for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to its correlation with degree of liver fibrosis. The aim of the current study was to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between serum HMGB1 levels and liver histology in adults and children with NAFLD participating in two large randomized controlled trials.\nMETHODS\nSerum HMGB1 levels were measured at various time points in adults and children with NAFLD, who participated in PIVENS and TONIC clinical trials respectively. PIVENS trial compared vitamin E or pioglitazone to placebo in adults whereas TONIC trial compared vitamin E or metformin to placebo in children. Participants had liver biopsies at baseline and the end of treatment (96 weeks), and liver histology was reviewed by a central committee of study pathologists.\nRESULTS\nIn the cross-sectional analyses (n = 205 for PIVENS and 109 for TONIC), there was no significant relationship between serum HMGB1 levels and histological features such as steatosis, ballooning, inflammation, fibrosis, or presence of steatohepatitis in either adults or children. Serum HMGB1 levels did not change significantly during treatment either with placebo, vitamin E therapy (P = 0.81) or pioglitazone (P = 0.09) in the PIVENS trial. Similarly, serum HMGB1 levels did not change significantly during treatment either with placebo, metformin (P = 0.15) or vitamin E (P = 0.23) in the TONIC trial. In the longitudinal analyses (n = 105 for PIVENS and 109 for TONIC), changes in serum HMGB1 levels did not correlate with histologic improvement or resolution of NASH in either adults or children. There was no relationship between serum HMGB1 and ALT levels in either adults or children with NAFLD.\nCONCLUSION\nSerum HMGB1 levels were not associated with histological severity or treatment response in either children or adults with NAFLD.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>I need the exact PIVENS (PMID: 20427778) histologic endpoint and adverse event numbers from the PubMed record; I will try browsing the PubMed page directly (tool call 3/5).</think>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20427778/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<think>I need the FLINT trial (PMID: 25601265) abstract details (histologic endpoints and key adverse events such as pruritus and lipid changes) for comparison; I will run a PubMed search targeting that PMID/trial (tool call 4/5).</think>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">25601265 FLINT obeticholic</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 14 results.

We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nMETHODS\nWe did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the USA in patients with non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to assess treatment with obeticholic acid given orally (25 mg daily) or placebo for 72 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01265498.\nFINDINGS\nBetween March 16, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 141 patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic acid and 142 to placebo. 50 (45%) of 110 patients in the obeticholic acid group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and 72 weeks had improved liver histology compared with 23 (21%) of 109 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 2·8; p=0·0002). 33 (23%) of 141 patients in the obeticholic acid developed pruritus compared with nine (6%) of 142 in the placebo group.\nINTERPRETATION\nObeticholic acid improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification.\nFUNDING\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Intercept Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27895393\">Title: Emerging role of obeticholic acid in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAuthors: Makri, Evangelia, Cholongitas, Evangelos, Tziomalos, Konstantinos | Year: 2016 | Journal: World journal of gastroenterology\nAbstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest chronic liver disease and its prevalence is increasing driven by the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic acid (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27031274\">Title: Bile salts in control of lipid metabolism.\nAuthors: Schonewille, Marleen, de Boer, Jan Freark, Groen, Albert K | Year: 2016 | Journal: Current opinion in lipidology\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nThe view on bile salts has evolved over the years from being regarded as simple detergents that aid intestinal absorption of fat-soluble nutrients to being important hormone-like integrators of metabolism. This review provides an update on the rapidly developing field of interactions between bile salts and lipid metabolism, with a particular emphasis on the underlying mechanisms.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nThe nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays major roles in bile salt-mediated signaling pathways. The recent identification of novel FXR targets and factors involved in FXR signaling highlights the interactions of bile acids with lipid metabolism. Exciting data have been reported on the use of intestine-specific FXR agonists as well as antagonists. In addition, encouraging results for treatment of hepatic steatosis obtained with obeticholic acid in the FLINT trial underline the therapeutic potential of bile salt signaling and metabolism for the treatment of lipid disorders.\nSUMMARY\nModulation of FXR activity appears to be a potent target, not only for improving bile salt homeostasis, but also to improve lipid metabolism. Depending on the metabolic context both, FXR agonists as well as antagonists, could prove to be of therapeutic benefit.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25926979\">Title: Recent advances in understanding/management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nAuthors: Pacana, Tommy, Sanyal, Arun J | Year: 2015 | Journal: F1000prime reports\nAbstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to advanced fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. A myriad of pathways and genetic influence contribute to NASH pathogenesis and liver disease progression. Diagnosing patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis is critical prior to treatment and prognostication. There has been ongoing interest in developing non-invasive biomarkers and tools for identifying NASH and advanced fibrosis. To date, there has been no approved therapy for NASH. Recently, the FLINT (Farnesoid X Receptor [FXR] Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment) trial provided promising results of the efficacy of obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, in improving histological features of NASH and fibrosis. Long-term studies are needed to assess the safety of obeticholic acid and its effects on liver- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35903833\">Title: Association of changes in histologic severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and changes in patient-reported quality of life.\nAuthors: Heath, Laura, Aveyard, Paul, Tomlinson, Jeremy W et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Hepatology communications\nAbstract: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent chronic disease that is associated with a spectrum of liver fibrosis and can lead to cirrhosis. Patients with NASH report lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than the general population. It remains uncertain how changes in histologic severity are associated with changes in HRQoL. This is a secondary analysis of the Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment (FLINT) and Pioglitazone, Vitamin E, or Placebo for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) randomized controlled trials in patients with biopsy-proven NASH. HRQoL was assessed using short form-36 at baseline and at follow-up biopsy (at 72 and 96 weeks, respectively). Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the association between changes in liver fibrosis (primary analysis), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (secondary analysis), and changes in HRQoL scores. Compared with stable fibrosis, improvement of fibrosis by at least one stage was significantly associated with improvements only in the physical function component by 1.8 points (95% confidence interval, 0.1, 3.5). Worsening of fibrosis by at least one stage was not associated with statistically significant changes in any HRQoL domain compared with stable fibrosis. Associations between HRQoL and NAFLD disease activity score in the secondary analysis were of similar magnitude. Weight loss was associated with small improvements in physical function, general health, and energy levels. Conclusion: Improvements in fibrosis stage were associated with improvements in the physical component of HRQoL, but the clinical impact was modest. As improving fibrosis may not meaningfully improve well-being, treatment for NASH will be cost effective only if it prevents long-term hepatic and cardiovascular disease.</snippet>\n</tool_output>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20427778/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20427778/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Pioglitazone, vitamin E, or placebo for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis \\nN Engl J Med. 2010 May 6;362(18):1675-85. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0907929.

In PIVENS 221 subjects had baseline and 96-week biopsies, and in FLINT 200 subjects had baseline and 72-week biopsies. Improvement in fibrosis was found in 38% of PIVENS and 29% of FLINT biopsies; fibrosis improvement was more likely in treated than placebo subjects in both studies. Controlling for treatment group, fibrosis improvement was associated most strongly with resolution of NASH (PIVENS, odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-7.6; P < 0.001; FLINT, OR, 8.0; 95% CI 3.1-20.9; P < 0.001), and improved NAS by ≥2 (PIVENS, OR, 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.3; P = 0.003; FLINT, OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.3; P < 0.001). Improvement in histologic features associated with improved fibrosis for both studies included steatosis, ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies, and portal, but not lobular, inflammation. Conclusion: These findings support a strong link between histologic resolution of steatohepatitis with improvement in fibrosis in NASH.", "year": "2019", "venue": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)"}, {"paperId": "38788522", "title": "FIB-4 as a screening and disease monitoring method in pre-fibrotic stages of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD).", "abstract": "AIMS\nGuidelines emphasize screening high-risk patients for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) with a calculated FIB-4 score for therapy to reverse fibrosis.

The primary outcome was an improvement in histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, as assessed with the use of a composite of standardized scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. Given the two planned primary comparisons, P values of less than 0.025 were considered to indicate statistical significance. \\n**Results:** Vitamin E therapy, as compared with placebo, was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (43% vs. 19%, P=0.001), but the differ"}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:33:58.993361"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "25601265 FLINT obeticholic", "result": {"total": 14, "data": [{"paperId": "25468160", "title": "Farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (FLINT): a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe bile acid derivative 6-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid (obeticholic acid) is a potent activator of the farnesoid X nuclear receptor that reduces liver fat and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures.

On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic acid (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis.

Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the association between changes in liver fibrosis (primary analysis), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (secondary analysis), and changes in HRQoL scores. Compared with stable fibrosis, improvement of fibrosis by at least one stage was significantly associated with improvements only in the physical function component by 1.8 points (95% confidence interval, 0.1, 3.5). Worsening of fibrosis by at least one stage was not associated with statistically significant changes in any HRQoL domain compared with stable fibrosis.

The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as analyzed in the pooled empagliflozin group versus the placebo group. The key secondary composite outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for unstable angina.\nRESULTS\nA total of 7020 patients were treated (median observation time, 3.1 years). The primary outcome occurred in 490 of 4687 patients (10.5%) in the pooled empagliflozin group and in 282 of 2333 patients (12.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.86; 95.02% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.04 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of myocardial infarction or stroke, but in the empagliflozin group there were significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes (3.7%, vs. 5.9% in the placebo group; 38% relative risk reduction), hospitalization for heart failure (2.7% and 4.1%, respectively; 35% relative risk reduction), and death from any cause (5.7% and 8.3%, respectively; 32% relative risk reduction). There was no significant between-group difference in the key secondary outcome (P=0.08 for superiority). Among patients receiving empagliflozin, there was an increased rate of genital infection but no increase in other adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study drug was added to standard care.

We investigated whether these effects varied across the spectrum of baseline cardiovascular risk.\nMETHODS\nCardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, 3-point MACE, and hospitalization for heart failure in the pooled empagliflozin and placebo groups were analyzed in subgroups by prior myocardial infarction and stroke at baseline, and by estimated baseline cardiovascular risk based on the 10-point TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention.\nRESULTS\nOf 7020 patients who received the study drug, 65% had a prior myocardial infarction or stroke, and 12%, 40%, 30%, and 18% were at low, intermediate, high, and highest estimated cardiovascular risk according to TIMI Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (≤2, 3, 4, and ≥5 points, respectively). In the placebo group, 3-point MACE occurred during the trial in 7.3%, 9.4%, 12.6%, and 20.6% of patients at low, intermediate, high, and highest estimated baseline risk, respectively. Relative reductions in risk of cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, 3-point MACE and hospitalization for heart failure with empagliflozin versus placebo were consistent in patients with and without prior myocardial infarction and/or stroke and across subgroups by TIMI Risk Score for Secondary Prevention at baseline ( P>0.05 for randomized group-by-subgroup interactions).\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite all patients having atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, patients in EMPA-REG OUTCOME demonstrated a broad risk spectrum for cardiovascular events. Reductions in key cardiovascular outcomes and mortality with empagliflozin versus placebo were consistent across the range of cardiovascular risk.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nURL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, agents used to lower blood glucose were felt to prevent or delay the development of microvascular complications, but were not known to definitively reduce cardiovascular risk or mortality. Previous studies with then novel sodium-glucose cotransport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors demonstrated improvements in several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, renal hyperfiltration, and albuminuria. However, as with other antihyperglycemic drugs, it could not be known if these salutary effects would translate into improved cardiorenal outcomes. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, SGLT2 inhibition with empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while also reducing mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of diabetic kidney disease. In the CANVAS Program trials using canagliflozin, the rates of the 3-point MACE endpoint, the risk of heart failure and the renal composite endpoint were also reduced, albeit with an increased risk of lower extremity amputation and fracture. As a result, clinical practice guidelines recommend the consideration of SGLT2 inhibition in high-risk patient subgroups for cardiovascular risk reduction. Ongoing primary renal endpoint trials will inform the cardio-metabolic-renal community about how to optimally treat patients with chronic kidney disease - including those with and without diabetes. Our aim is to review the rationale for renal protection with SGLT2 inhibitors, and their current place in the clinical management of patients with kidney disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32414364\">Title: Empagliflozin prevents doxorubicin-induced myocardial dysfunction.\nAuthors: Sabatino, Jolanda, De Rosa, Salvatore, Tammè, Laura et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Cardiovascular diabetology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nEmpagliflozin showed efficacy in controlling glycaemia, leading to reductions in HbA1c levels, weight loss and blood pressure, compared to standard treatment. Moreover, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial demonstrated a 14% reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a 38% reduction in cardiovascular (CV) death and a 35% reduction in the hospitalization rate for heart failure (HF). These beneficial effect on HF were apparently independent from glucose control. However, no mechanistic in vivo studies are available to explain these results, yet. We aimed to determine the effect of empagliflozin on left ventricular (LV) function in a mouse model of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (DOX-HF).\nMETHODS\nMale C57Bl/6 mice were randomly assigned to the following groups: controls (CTRL, n = 7), doxorubicin (DOX, n = 14), DOX plus empagliflozin (DOX + EMPA, n = 14), or DOX plus furosemide (DOX + FURO group, n = 7). DOX was injected intraperitoneally. LV function was evaluated at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment using high-resolution echocardiography with 2D speckle tracking (Vevo 2100). Histological assessment was obtained using Haematoxylin and Eosin and Masson's Goldner staining.\nRESULTS\nA significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic LV function was observed after 6 weeks of treatment with doxorubicin. EF dropped by 32% (p = 0.002), while the LS was reduced by 42% (p < 0.001) and the CS by 50% (p < 0.001). However, LV function was significantly better in the DOX + EMPA group, both in terms of EF (61.30 ± 11% vs. 49.24 ± 8%, p = 0.007), LS (- 17.52 ± 3% vs. - 13.93 ± 5%, p = 0.04) and CS (- 25.75 ± 6% vs. - 15.91 ± 6%, p < 0.001). Those results were not duplicated in the DOX + FURO group. Hearts from the DOX + EMPA group showed a 50% lower degree of myocardial fibrosis, compared to DOX mice (p = 0.03). No significant differences were found between the DOX + FURO and the DOX group (p = 0.103).\nCONCLUSION\nEmpagliflozin attenuates the cardiotoxic effects exerted by doxorubicin on LV function and remodelling in nondiabetic mice, independently of glycaemic control. These findings support the design of clinical studies to assess their relevance in a clinical setting.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27470878\">Title: Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: Cardiovascular and Kidney Effects, Potential Mechanisms, and Clinical Applications.\nAuthors: Heerspink, Hiddo J L, Perkins, Bruce A, Fitchett, David H et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: Circulation\nAbstract: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mm Hg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and >30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">CANVAS Program hospitalization heart failure</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 56 results.

We report the effects on heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death overall, in those with and without a baseline history of HF, and in other participant subgroups.\nMETHODS\nThe CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) enrolled 10 142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk. Participants were randomly assigned to canagliflozin or placebo and followed for a mean of 188 weeks. The primary end point for these analyses was adjudicated cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF.\nRESULTS\nParticipants with a history of HF at baseline (14.4%) were more frequently women, white, and hypertensive and had a history of prior cardiovascular disease (all P<0.001). Greater proportions of these patients were using therapies such as blockers of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, diuretics, and β-blockers at baseline (all P<0.001). Overall, cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF was reduced in those treated with canagliflozin compared with placebo (16.3 versus 20.8 per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.91), as was fatal or hospitalized HF (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89) and hospitalized HF alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87). The benefit on cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF may be greater in patients with a prior history of HF (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46-0.80) compared with those without HF at baseline (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72-1.06; P interaction =0.021). The effects of canagliflozin compared with placebo on other cardiovascular outcomes and key safety outcomes were similar in participants with and without HF at baseline (all interaction P values >0.130), except for a possibly reduced absolute rate of events attributable to osmotic diuresis among those with a prior history of HF ( P=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, canagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalized HF across a broad range of different patient subgroups. Benefits may be greater in those with a history of HF at baseline.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nURL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

However, the lifetime benefits of combination therapy with these medicines are not known.\nMETHODS\nWe used data from 2 SGLT2i trials (CANVAS [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment] and CREDENCE [Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation]), 2 ns-MRA trials (FIDELIO-DKD [Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease] and FIGARO-DKD [Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Clinical Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease]), and 8 GLP-1 RA trials to estimate the relative effects of combination therapy versus conventional care (renin-angiotensin system blockade and traditional risk factor control) on cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes. Using actuarial methods, we then estimated absolute risk reductions with combination SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g) by applying estimated combination treatment effects to participants receiving conventional care in CANVAS and CREDENCE.\nRESULTS\nCompared with conventional care, the combination of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.55-0.76) for major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death). The corresponding estimated absolute risk reduction over 3 years was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.0-5.7), with a number needed to treat of 23 (95% CI, 18-33). For a 50-year-old patient commencing combination therapy, estimated major adverse cardiovascular event-free survival was 21.1 years compared with 17.9 years for conventional care (3.2 years gained [95% CI, 2.1-4.3]). There were also projected gains in survival free from hospitalized heart failure (3.2 years [95% CI, 2.4-4.0]), chronic kidney disease progression (5.5 years [95% CI, 4.0-6.7]), cardiovascular death (2.2 years [95% CI, 1.2-3.0]), and all-cause death (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.4-3.4]). Attenuated but clinically relevant gains in event-free survival were observed in analyses assuming 50% additive effects of combination therapy, including for major adverse cardiovascular events (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.1-3.5]), chronic kidney disease progression (4.5 years [95% CI, 2.8-5.9]), and all-cause death (1.8 years [95% CI, 0.7-2.8]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria, combination treatment of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA has the potential to afford relevant gains in cardiovascular and kidney event-free and overall survival.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29735306\">Title: Renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.\nAuthors: Heerspink, Hiddo J L, Kosiborod, Mikhail, Inzucchi, Silvio E et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Kidney international\nAbstract: Over the past two years, our understanding of anti-hyperglycemic medications used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has fundamentally changed.

The outcomes of interest were MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction , or stroke), individual components of MACE (inclusive of fatal and nonfatal events), all-cause mortality, and death subtypes. Effect estimates for SGLT2i versus placebo were meta-analyzed across trials and examined across key subgroups (established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, previous HF, albuminuria, chronic kidney disease stages, and risk groups).\nRESULTS\nA total of 78 607 patients across 11 trials were included: 42 568 (54.2%), 20 725 (26.4%), and 15 314 (19.5%) were included from trials of patients with diabetes at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF, or chronic kidney disease, respectively. SGLT2i reduced the rate of MACE by 9% (hazard ration [HR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.96], P <0.0001) with a consistent effect across all 3 patient populations ( I 2 =0%) and across all key subgroups. This effect was primarily driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81-0.92], P <0.0001), with no significant effect for myocardial infarction in the overall population (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87-1.04], P =0.29), and no effect on stroke (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91-1.07], P =0.77). The benefit for cardiovascular death was driven primarily by reductions in HF death and sudden cardiac death (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.46-1.02] and HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.78-0.95], respectively) and was generally consistent across subgroups, with the possible exception of being more apparent in those with albuminuria ( P interaction =0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS\nSGLT2i reduce the risk of MACE across a broad range of patients irrespective of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney function, or other major clinical characteristics at baseline. This effect is driven primarily by a reduction of cardiovascular death, particularly HF death and sudden cardiac death, without a significant effect on myocardial infarction in the overall population, and no effect on stroke. These data may help inform selection for SGLT2i therapies across the spectrum of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38991584\">Title: Efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors with and without glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists: a SMART-C collaborative meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\nAuthors: Apperloo, Ellen M, Neuen, Brendon L, Fletcher, Robert A et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: The lancet. Diabetes & endocrinology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nSGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists both improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. We sought to evaluate whether the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent in patients receiving and not receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a collaborative meta-analysis of trials included in the SGLT2 Inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium, restricted to participants with diabetes. Treatment effects from individual trials were obtained from Cox regression models and pooled using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. The two main cardiovascular outcomes assessed included major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death), and hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death. The main kidney outcomes assessed were chronic kidney disease progression (≥40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], kidney failure [eGFR <15 mL/min/1·73 m 2 , chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation], or death due to kidney failure), and the rate of change in eGFR over time. Safety outcomes were also assessed.\nFINDINGS\nAcross 12 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, 3065 (4·2%) of 73 238 participants with diabetes were using GLP-1 receptor agonists at baseline. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in participants both receiving and not receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists (hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·63-1·03 vs 0·90, 0·86-0·94; p-heterogeneity=0·31). Effects on hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death (0·76, 0·57-1·01 vs 0·78, 0·74-0·82; p-heterogeneity=0·90) and chronic kidney disease progression (0·65, 0·46-0·94 vs 0·67, 0·62-0·72; p-heterogeneity=0·81) were also consistent regardless of GLP-1 receptor agonist use, as was the effect on the chronic rate of change in eGFR over time (heterogeneity=0·92). Fewer serious adverse events occurred with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo, irrespective of GLP-1 receptor agonist use (relative risk 0·87, 95% CI 0·79-0·96 vs 0·91, 0·89-0·93; p-heterogeneity=0·41).\nINTERPRETATION\nThe effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes are consistent regardless of the background use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. These findings suggest independent effects of these evidence-based therapies and support clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of these agents in combination to improve cardiovascular and kidney metabolic outcomes.\nFUNDING\nNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and the Ramaciotti Foundation.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">DECLARE TIMI 58 hospitalization heart failure</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 98 results.

The primary safety outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy outcomes were MACE and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a renal composite (≥40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate to <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area, new end-stage renal disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes) and death from any cause.\nRESULTS\nWe evaluated 17,160 patients, including 10,186 without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who were followed for a median of 4.2 years. In the primary safety outcome analysis, dapagliflozin met the prespecified criterion for noninferiority to placebo with respect to MACE (upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval [CI], <1.3; P<0.001 for noninferiority). In the two primary efficacy analyses, dapagliflozin did not result in a lower rate of MACE (8.8% in the dapagliflozin group and 9.4% in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.03; P=0.17) but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (4.9% vs. 5.8%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005), which reflected a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88); there was no between-group difference in cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.17). A renal event occurred in 4.3% in the dapagliflozin group and in 5.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.87), and death from any cause occurred in 6.2% and 6.6%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.04). Diabetic ketoacidosis was more common with dapagliflozin than with placebo (0.3% vs. 0.1%, P=0.02), as was the rate of genital infections that led to discontinuation of the regimen or that were considered to be serious adverse events (0.9% vs. 0.1%, P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, treatment with dapagliflozin did not result in a higher or lower rate of MACE than placebo but did result in a lower rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, a finding that reflects a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure.

We report a prespecified analysis of the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg on ischaemic and heart failure cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to investigate if semaglutide was beneficial in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a history of heart failure compared with placebo; if there was a difference in outcome in patients designated as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; and if the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with heart failure was related to baseline characteristics or subtype of heart failure.\nMETHODS\nThe SELECT trial was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, event-driven phase 3 trial in 41 countries. Adults aged 45 years and older, with a BMI of 27 kg/m 2 or greater and established cardiovascular disease were eligible for the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a block size of four using an interactive web response system in a double-blind manner to escalating doses of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide over 16 weeks to a target dose of 2·4 mg, or placebo. In a prespecified analysis, we examined the effect of semaglutide compared with placebo in patients with and without a history of heart failure at enrolment, subclassified as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or unclassified heart failure. Endpoints comprised MACE (a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death); a composite heart failure outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalisation or urgent hospital visit for heart failure); cardiovascular death; and all-cause death. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Oct 31, 2018, and March 31, 2021, 17 604 patients with a mean age of 61·6 years (SD 8·9) and a mean BMI of 33·4 kg/m 2 (5·0) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide (8803 [50·0%] patients) or placebo (8801 [50·0%] patients). 4286 (24·3%) of 17 604 patients had a history of investigator-defined heart failure at enrolment: 2273 (53·0%) of 4286 patients had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 1347 (31·4%) had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and 666 (15·5%) had unclassified heart failure. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with and without heart failure. Patients with heart failure had a higher incidence of clinical events. Semaglutide improved all outcome measures in patients with heart failure at random assignment compared with those without heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·72, 95% CI 0·60-0·87 for MACE; 0·79, 0·64-0·98 for the heart failure composite endpoint; 0·76, 0·59-0·97 for cardiovascular death; and 0·81, 0·66-1·00 for all-cause death; all p interaction >0·19). Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improved outcomes in both the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HR 0·65, 95% CI 0·49-0·87 for MACE; 0·79, 0·58-1·08 for the composite heart failure endpoint) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction groups (0·69, 0·51-0·91 for MACE; 0·75, 0·52-1·07 for the composite heart failure endpoint), although patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction had higher absolute event rates than those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. For MACE and the heart failure composite, there were no significant differences in benefits across baseline age, sex, BMI, New York Heart Association status, and diuretic use. Serious adverse events were less frequent with semaglutide versus placebo, regardless of heart failure subtype.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diease and overweight or obesity, treatment with semaglutide 2·4 mg reduced MACE and composite heart failure endpoints compared with placebo in those with and without clinical heart failure, regardless of heart failure subtype. Our findings could facilitate prescribing and result in improved clinical outcomes for this patient group.\nFUNDING\nNovo Nordisk.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38730538\">Title: The long-term effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease: a time-to-event analysis.\nAuthors: McEwan, Phil, Gabb, Peter D, Davis, Jason A et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a significant clinical and economic burden to healthcare systems worldwide, which increases considerably with progression towards kidney failure. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial demonstrated that patients with or without type 2 diabetes who were treated with dapagliflozin experienced slower progression of CKD versus those receiving placebo. Understanding the effect of long-term treatment with dapagliflozin on the timing of kidney failure beyond trial follow-up can assist informed decision-making by healthcare providers and patients. The study objective was therefore to extrapolate the outcome-based clinical benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with CKD via a time-to-event analysis using trial data.\nMETHODS\nPatient-level data from the DAPA-CKD trial were used to parameterize a closed cohort-level partitioned survival model that predicted time-to-event for key trial endpoints (kidney failure, all-cause mortality, sustained decline in kidney function and hospitalization for heart failure). Data were pooled with a subpopulation of the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial to create a combined CKD population spanning a range of CKD stages; a parallel survival analysis was conducted in this population.\nRESULTS\nIn the DAPA-CKD and pooled CKD populations, treatment with dapagliflozin delayed time to first event for kidney failure, all-cause mortality, sustained decline in kidney function and hospitalization for heart failure. Attenuation of CKD progression was predicted to slow the time to kidney failure by 6.6 years [dapagliflozin: 25.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 19.0-31.5; standard therapy: 18.5, 95% CI 14.7-23.4] in the DAPA-CKD population. A similar result was observed in the pooled CKD population with an estimated delay of 6.3 years (dapagliflozin: 36.0, 95% CI 31.9-38.3; standard therapy: 29.6, 95% CI 25.5-34.7).\nCONCLUSION\nTreatment with dapagliflozin over a lifetime time horizon may considerably delay the mean time to adverse clinical outcomes for patients who would go on to experience them, including those at modest risk of progression.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31983236\">Title: Effect of Dapagliflozin on Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Insights From the DECLARE-TIMI 58 Trial.\nAuthors: Zelniker, Thomas A, Bonaca, Marc P, Furtado, Remo H M et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Circulation\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are associated with both diabetes mellitus and its related comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, and heart failure (HF). SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors have been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce weight, have salutary effects on left ventricular remodeling, and reduce hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We therefore investigated whether SGLT2 inhibitors could also reduce the risk of AF/AFL.\nMETHODS\nDECLARE-TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58) studied the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus placebo in 17 160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=10 186) or known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=6974). We explored the effect of dapagliflozin on the first and total number of AF/AFL events in patients with (n=1116) and without prevalent AF/AFL using Cox and negative binomial models, respectively. AF/AFL events were identified by search of the safety database using MedDRA preferred terms (\"atrial fibrillation,\" \"atrial flutter\").\nRESULTS\nDapagliflozin reduced the risk of AF/AFL events by 19% (264 versus 325 events; 7.8 versus 9.6 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.95]; P =0.009). The reduction in AF/AFL events was consistent regardless of presence or absence of a history of AF/AFL at baseline (previous AF/AFL: HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.58-1.09]; no AF/AFL: HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98]; P for interaction 0.89). Similarly, presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.66-1.04]) versus multiple risk factors (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.62-0.99]; P for interaction 0.72) or a history of HF (HF: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.55-1.11]; No HF: HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.97]; P for interaction 0.88) did not modify the reduction in AF/AFL events observed with dapagliflozin. Moreover, there was no effect modification by sex, history of ischemic stroke, glycated hemoglobin A 1c , body mass index, blood pressure, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (all P for interaction >0.20). Dapagliflozin also reduced the total number (first and recurrent) of AF/AFL events (337 versus 432; incidence rate ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.64-0.92]; P =0.005).\nCONCLUSIONS\nDapagliflozin decreased the incidence of reported episodes of AF/AFL adverse events in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This effect was consistent regardless of the patient's previous history of AF, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or HF.

In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to <90 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], >300 to 5000) and were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of <15 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 ), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.\nRESULTS\nThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P = 0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P<0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P = 0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P = 0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

We report the effects of treatment with canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes. Methods The CANVAS Program integrated data from two trials involving a total of 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Participants in each trial were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin or placebo and were followed for a mean of 188.2 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Results The mean age of the participants was 63.3 years, 35.8% were women, the mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6% had a history of cardiovascular disease. The rate of the primary outcome was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.02 for superiority). Although on the basis of the prespecified hypothesis testing sequence the renal outcomes are not viewed as statistically significant, the results showed a possible benefit of canagliflozin with respect to the progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and the composite outcome of a sustained 40% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal causes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Adverse reactions were consistent with the previously reported risks associated with canagliflozin except for an increased risk of amputation (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. Conclusions In two trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, patients treated with canagliflozin had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those who received placebo but a greater risk of amputation, primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal.

Interventions included monotherapies (134 trials), add-on to metformin-based therapies (296 trials), and monotherapies versus add-on to metformin therapies (23 trials). There were no differences between treatments in drug-naive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Insulin regimens and specific glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) added to metformin-based background therapy produced the greatest reductions in hemoglobin A 1c level. In patients at low cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (298 trials), there were no clinically meaningful differences between treatments for mortality and vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (21 trials), oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, liraglutide, extended-release exenatide, and dapagliflozin reduced all-cause mortality. Oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, and liraglutide also reduced cardiovascular death. Odds of stroke were lower with subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced heart failure hospitalization and end-stage renal disease. Subcutaneous semaglutide and canagliflozin increased diabetic retinopathy and amputation, respectively.\nLIMITATION\nInconsistent definitions of cardiovascular risk and low-level confidence in some estimates for patients at low cardiovascular risk.\nCONCLUSION\nIn diabetic patients at low cardiovascular risk, no treatment differs from placebo for vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background therapy, specific GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors have a favorable effect on certain cardiovascular outcomes.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nEuropean Foundation for the Study of Diabetes, supported by an unrestricted educational grant from AstraZeneca.

It is unclear whether this association occurs with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition.\nMETHODS\nThe Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial enrolled 4401 patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio [UACR] >300 mg/g). This post hoc analysis assessed canagliflozin's effect on albuminuria and how early change in albuminuria (baseline to week 26) is associated with the primary kidney outcome (ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, or kidney death), major adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS\nComplete data for early change in albuminuria and other covariates were available for 3836 (87.2%) participants in the CREDENCE trial. Compared with placebo, canagliflozin lowered UACR by 31% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 27% to 36%) at week 26, and significantly increased the likelihood of achieving a 30% reduction in UACR (odds ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 2.35 to 3.07). Each 30% decrease in UACR over the first 26 weeks was independently associated with a lower hazard for the primary kidney outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.76; P <0.001), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96; P <0.001), and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.90; P <0.001). Residual albuminuria levels at week 26 remained a strong independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular events, overall and in each treatment arm.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use of canagliflozin results in early, sustained reductions in albuminuria, which were independently associated with long-term kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37952217\">Title: Estimated Lifetime Cardiovascular, Kidney, and Mortality Benefits of Combination Treatment With SGLT2 Inhibitors, GLP-1 Receptor Agonists, and Nonsteroidal MRA Compared With Conventional Care in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Albuminuria.\nAuthors: Neuen, Brendon L, Heerspink, Hiddo J L, Vart, Priya et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Circulation\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nSodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) finerenone all individually reduce cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria. However, the lifetime benefits of combination therapy with these medicines are not known.\nMETHODS\nWe used data from 2 SGLT2i trials (CANVAS [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment] and CREDENCE [Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation]), 2 ns-MRA trials (FIDELIO-DKD [Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease] and FIGARO-DKD [Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Clinical Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease]), and 8 GLP-1 RA trials to estimate the relative effects of combination therapy versus conventional care (renin-angiotensin system blockade and traditional risk factor control) on cardiovascular, kidney, and mortality outcomes. Using actuarial methods, we then estimated absolute risk reductions with combination SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g) by applying estimated combination treatment effects to participants receiving conventional care in CANVAS and CREDENCE.\nRESULTS\nCompared with conventional care, the combination of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.55-0.76) for major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death). The corresponding estimated absolute risk reduction over 3 years was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.0-5.7), with a number needed to treat of 23 (95% CI, 18-33). For a 50-year-old patient commencing combination therapy, estimated major adverse cardiovascular event-free survival was 21.1 years compared with 17.9 years for conventional care (3.2 years gained [95% CI, 2.1-4.3]). There were also projected gains in survival free from hospitalized heart failure (3.2 years [95% CI, 2.4-4.0]), chronic kidney disease progression (5.5 years [95% CI, 4.0-6.7]), cardiovascular death (2.2 years [95% CI, 1.2-3.0]), and all-cause death (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.4-3.4]). Attenuated but clinically relevant gains in event-free survival were observed in analyses assuming 50% additive effects of combination therapy, including for major adverse cardiovascular events (2.4 years [95% CI, 1.1-3.5]), chronic kidney disease progression (4.5 years [95% CI, 2.8-5.9]), and all-cause death (1.8 years [95% CI, 0.7-2.8]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes and at least moderately increased albuminuria, combination treatment of SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and ns-MRA has the potential to afford relevant gains in cardiovascular and kidney event-free and overall survival.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\nAcross these three large cardiovascular outcomes trials in type 2 diabetes, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on **hospitalization for heart failure (HHF)** is **highly consistent in direction and broadly similar in magnitude**, with all showing a statistically significant reduction versus placebo.\n\n### Trial-by-trial HHF effects (SGLT2 inhibitor vs placebo)\n- **EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin)**: HHF occurred in 2.7% vs 4.1% (reported as ~35% relative risk reduction). <cite id=\"26378978\">EMPA-REG OUTCOME reported significantly lower HHF with empagliflozin vs placebo (2.7% vs 4.1%; ~35% relative risk reduction).</cite>\n\n- **CANVAS Program (canagliflozin)**: HHF reduced with canagliflozin vs placebo (hazard ratio **HR 0.67**, 95% CI 0.52–0.87). <cite id=\"29526832\">CANVAS Program heart failure analysis reported reduced hospitalized HF with canagliflozin (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.87).</cite>\n\n- **DECLARE–TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin)**: HHF reduced with dapagliflozin vs placebo (HR **0.73**, 95% CI 0.61–0.88). <cite id=\"30415602\">DECLARE–TIMI 58 reported lower HHF with dapagliflozin (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.61–0.88).</cite>\n\n### Consistency summary\n- **Direction:** all three trials show **fewer HHF events** with an SGLT2 inhibitor.\n- **Magnitude:** point estimates cluster around a **~27–35% relative reduction** (HR roughly **0.65–0.75**).\n- **Statistical strength:** each trial reports a **significant** reduction in HHF versus placebo in the main publication or prespecified analyses. <cite id=\"26378978\">Empagliflozin reduced HHF.</cite> <cite id=\"29526832\">Canagliflozin reduced HHF.</cite> <cite id=\"30415602\">Dapagliflozin reduced HHF.</cite>\n\nOverall, HHF reduction appears to be one of the most reproducible cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes across these major outcomes trials.\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26378978/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26378978/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes \\nN Engl J Med. 2015 Nov 26;373(22):2117-28. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1504720.

The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as analyzed in the pooled empagliflozin group versus the placebo group. The key secondary composite outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for unstable angina.\nRESULTS\nA total of 7020 patients were treated (median observation time, 3.1 years).

Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mm Hg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and >30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal.

The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial demonstrated that patients with or without type 2 diabetes who were treated with dapagliflozin experienced slower progression of CKD versus those receiving placebo. Understanding the effect of long-term treatment with dapagliflozin on the timing of kidney failure beyond trial follow-up can assist informed decision-making by healthcare providers and patients. The study objective was therefore to extrapolate the outcome-based clinical benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with CKD via a time-to-event analysis using trial data.\nMETHODS\nPatient-level data from the DAPA-CKD trial were used to parameterize a closed cohort-level partitioned survival model that predicted time-to-event for key trial endpoints (kidney failure, all-cause mortality, sustained decline in kidney function and hospitalization for heart failure). Data were pooled with a subpopulation of the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial to create a combined CKD population spanning a range of CKD stages; a parallel survival analysis was conducted in this population.\nRESULTS\nIn the DAPA-CKD and pooled CKD populations, treatment with dapagliflozin delayed time to first event for kidney failure, all-cause mortality, sustained decline in kidney function and hospitalization for heart failure.

SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors have been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce weight, have salutary effects on left ventricular remodeling, and reduce hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We therefore investigated whether SGLT2 inhibitors could also reduce the risk of AF/AFL.\nMETHODS\nDECLARE-TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58) studied the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus placebo in 17 160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=10 186) or known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n=6974). We explored the effect of dapagliflozin on the first and total number of AF/AFL events in patients with (n=1116) and without prevalent AF/AFL using Cox and negative binomial models, respectively. AF/AFL events were identified by search of the safety database using MedDRA preferred terms (\"atrial fibrillation,\" \"atrial flutter\").\nRESULTS\nDapagliflozin reduced the risk of AF/AFL events by 19% (264 versus 325 events; 7.8 versus 9.6 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.95]; P =0.009).

All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to <90 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], >300 to 5000) and were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of <15 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 ), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.\nRESULTS\nThe trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee.

Analysis of patient fecal microbiome samples ( n = 43, 30 responders, 13 nonresponders) showed significantly higher alpha diversity ( P < 0.01) and relative abundance of bacteria of the Ruminococcaceae family ( P < 0.01) in responding patients. Metagenomic studies revealed functional differences in gut bacteria in responders, including enrichment of anabolic pathways. Immune profiling suggested enhanced systemic and antitumor immunity in responding patients with a favorable gut microbiome as well as in germ-free mice receiving fecal transplants from responding patients. Together, these data have important implications for the treatment of melanoma patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34941392\">Title: Dietary fiber and probiotics influence the gut microbiome and melanoma immunotherapy response.\nAuthors: Spencer, Christine N, McQuade, Jennifer L, Gopalakrishnan, Vancheswaran et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)\nAbstract: Gut bacteria modulate the response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment in cancer, but the effect of diet and supplements on this interaction is not well studied. We assessed fecal microbiota profiles, dietary habits, and commercially available probiotic supplement use in melanoma patients and performed parallel preclinical studies. Higher dietary fiber was associated with significantly improved progression-free survival in 128 patients on ICB, with the most pronounced benefit observed in patients with sufficient dietary fiber intake and no probiotic use. Findings were recapitulated in preclinical models, which demonstrated impaired treatment response to anti–programmed cell death 1 (anti–PD-1)–based therapy in mice receiving a low-fiber diet or probiotics, with a lower frequency of interferon-γ–positive cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Together, these data have clinical implications for patients receiving ICB for cancer.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34239137\">Title: Gut microbiota signatures are associated with toxicity to combined CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade.\nAuthors: Andrews, Miles C, Duong, Connie P M, Gopalakrishnan, Vancheswaran et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Nature medicine\nAbstract: Treatment with combined immune checkpoint blockade (CICB) targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 is associated with clinical benefit across tumor types, but also a high rate of immune-related adverse events. Insights into biomarkers and mechanisms of response and toxicity to CICB are needed. To address this, we profiled the blood, tumor and gut microbiome of 77 patients with advanced melanoma treated with CICB, with a high rate of any ≥grade 3 immune-related adverse events (49%) with parallel studies in pre-clinical models. Tumor-associated immune and genomic biomarkers of response to CICB were similar to those identified for ICB monotherapy, and toxicity from CICB was associated with a more diverse peripheral T-cell repertoire. Profiling of gut microbiota demonstrated a significantly higher abundance of Bacteroides intestinalis in patients with toxicity, with upregulation of mucosal IL-1β in patient samples of colitis and in pre-clinical models. Together, these data offer potential new therapeutic angles for targeting toxicity to CICB.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31481761\">Title: Sustained Type I interferon signaling as a mechanism of resistance to PD-1 blockade.\nAuthors: Jacquelot, Nicolas, Yamazaki, Takahiro, Roberti, Maria P et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Cell research\nAbstract: PD-1 blockade represents a major therapeutic avenue in anticancer immunotherapy. Delineating mechanisms of secondary resistance to this strategy is increasingly important. Here, we identified the deleterious role of signaling via the type I interferon (IFN) receptor in tumor and antigen presenting cells, that induced the expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), associated with intratumor accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid cells and acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Sustained IFNβ transcription was observed in resistant tumors, in turn inducing PD-L1 and NOS2 expression in both tumor and dendritic cells (DC). Whereas PD-L1 was not involved in secondary resistance to anti-PD-1 mAb, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NOS2 maintained long-term control of tumors by PD-1 blockade, through reduction of Treg and DC activation. Resistance to immunotherapies, including anti-PD-1 mAb in melanoma patients, was also correlated with the induction of a type I IFN signature. Hence, the role of type I IFN in response to PD-1 blockade should be revisited as sustained type I IFN signaling may contribute to resistance to therapy.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">Matson melanoma microbiome PD-1</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

Among the variables that could contribute to interpatient heterogeneity is differential composition of the patients' microbiome, which has been shown to affect antitumor immunity and immunotherapy efficacy in preclinical mouse models. We analyzed baseline stool samples from metastatic melanoma patients before immunotherapy treatment, through an integration of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for selected bacteria. A significant association was observed between commensal microbial composition and clinical response. Bacterial species more abundant in responders included Bifidobacterium longum , Collinsella aerofaciens , and Enterococcus faecium. Reconstitution of germ-free mice with fecal material from responding patients could lead to improved tumor control, augmented T cell responses, and greater efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy.

Using pooled CRISPRi screens, we discovered that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) impedes prime editing and promotes undesired indel byproducts. We developed PE4 and PE5 prime editing systems in which transient expression of an engineered MMR-inhibiting protein enhances the efficiency of substitution, small insertion, and small deletion prime edits by an average 7.7-fold and 2.0-fold compared to PE2 and PE3 systems, respectively, while improving edit/indel ratios by 3.4-fold in MMR-proficient cell types. Strategic installation of silent mutations near the intended edit can enhance prime editing outcomes by evading MMR. Prime editor protein optimization resulted in a PEmax architecture that enhances editing efficacy by 2.8-fold on average in HeLa cells. These findings enrich our understanding of prime editing and establish prime editing systems that show substantial improvement across 191 edits in seven mammalian cell types.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36344749\">Title: Prime editing for precise and highly versatile genome manipulation.\nAuthors: Chen, Peter J, Liu, David R | Year: 2023 | Journal: Nature reviews. Genetics\nAbstract: Programmable gene-editing tools have transformed the life sciences and have shown potential for the treatment of genetic disease. Among the CRISPR-Cas technologies that can currently make targeted DNA changes in mammalian cells, prime editors offer an unusual combination of versatility, specificity and precision. Prime editors do not require double-strand DNA breaks and can make virtually any substitution, small insertion and small deletion within the DNA of living cells. Prime editing minimally requires a programmable nickase fused to a polymerase enzyme, and an extended guide RNA that both specifies the target site and templates the desired genome edit. In this Review, we summarize prime editing strategies to generate programmed genomic changes, highlight their limitations and recent developments that circumvent some of these bottlenecks, and discuss applications and future directions.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34608327\">Title: Engineered pegRNAs improve prime editing efficiency.\nAuthors: Nelson, James W, Randolph, Peyton B, Shen, Simon P et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature biotechnology\nAbstract: Prime editing enables the installation of virtually any combination of point mutations, small insertions or small deletions in the DNA of living cells. A prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) directs the prime editor protein to the targeted locus and also encodes the desired edit. Here we show that degradation of the 3' region of the pegRNA that contains the reverse transcriptase template and the primer binding site can poison the activity of prime editing systems, impeding editing efficiency. We incorporated structured RNA motifs to the 3' terminus of pegRNAs that enhance their stability and prevent degradation of the 3' extension. The resulting engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs) improve prime editing efficiency 3-4-fold in HeLa, U2OS and K562 cells and in primary human fibroblasts without increasing off-target editing activity. We optimized the choice of 3' structural motif and developed pegLIT, a computational tool to identify non-interfering nucleotide linkers between pegRNAs and 3' motifs. Finally, we showed that epegRNAs enhance the efficiency of the installation or correction of disease-relevant mutations.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35941224\">Title: Designing and executing prime editing experiments in mammalian cells.\nAuthors: Doman, Jordan L, Sousa, Alexander A, Randolph, Peyton B et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature protocols\nAbstract: Prime editing (PE) is a precision gene editing technology that enables the programmable installation of substitutions, insertions and deletions in cells and animals without requiring double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The mechanism of PE makes it less dependent on cellular replication and endogenous DNA repair than homology-directed repair-based approaches, and its ability to precisely install edits without creating DSBs minimizes indels and other undesired outcomes. The capabilities of PE have also expanded since its original publication. Enhanced PE systems, PE4 and PE5, manipulate DNA repair pathways to increase PE efficiency and reduce indels. Other advances that improve PE efficiency include engineered pegRNAs (epegRNAs), which include a structured RNA motif to stabilize and protect pegRNA 3' ends, and the PEmax architecture, which improves editor expression and nuclear localization. New applications such as twin PE (twinPE) can precisely insert or delete hundreds of base pairs of DNA and can be used in tandem with recombinases to achieve gene-sized (&gt;5 kb) insertions and inversions. Achieving optimal PE requires careful experimental design, and the large number of parameters that influence PE outcomes can be daunting. This protocol describes current best practices for conducting PE and twinPE experiments and describes the design and optimization of pegRNAs. We also offer guidelines for how to select the proper PE system (PE1 to PE5 and twinPE) for a given application. Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to perform PE in mammalian cells. Compared with other procedures for editing human cells, PE offers greater precision and versatility, and can be completed within 2-4 weeks.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37002157\">Title: Prime editing: advances and therapeutic applications.\nAuthors: Zhao, Zhihan, Shang, Peng, Mohanraju, Prarthana et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Trends in biotechnology\nAbstract: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas)-mediated genome editing has revolutionized biomedical research and will likely change the therapeutic and diagnostic landscape. However, CRISPR-Cas9, which edits DNA by activating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, is not always sufficient for gene therapy applications where precise mutation repair is required. Prime editing, the latest revolution in genome-editing technologies, can achieve any possible base substitution, insertion, or deletion without the requirement for DSBs. However, prime editing is still in its infancy, and further development is needed to improve editing efficiency and delivery strategies for therapeutic applications. We summarize latest developments in the optimization of prime editor (PE) variants with improved editing efficiency and precision. Moreover, we highlight some potential therapeutic applications.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">Anzalone prime editing 2019</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 3 results.

Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay-Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31835025\">Title: One Prime for All Editing.\nAuthors: Yang, Li, Yang, Bei, Chen, Jia | Year: 2019 | Journal: Cell\nAbstract: Many targeted base transversions, insertions, and deletions remain challenging due to the lack of precise and efficient genome editing technologies.

Clinically affected individuals without two identified causal variants typically have no further interrogation of CFTR beyond examination of coding regions, but the development of variant-specific CFTR-targeted treatments necessitates complete understanding of CFTR genotype.\nMETHODS\nWhole genome sequences were analyzed on 5,058 individuals with CF. We focused on the full CFTR gene sequence and identified disease-causing variants in three phases: screening for known and structural variants; discovery of novel loss-of-function variants; and investigation of remaining variants.\nRESULTS\nAll variants identified in the first two phases and coding region variants found in the third phase were interpreted according to CFTR2 or ACMG criteria (n = 371; 16 [4.3%] previously unreported). Full gene sequencing enabled delineation of 18 structural variants (large insertions or deletions), of which two were novel. Additional CFTR variants of uncertain effect were found in 76 F508del homozygotes and in 21 individuals with other combinations of CF-causing variants. Both causative variants were identified in 98.1% (n = 4,960) of subjects, an increase of 2.3 percentage points from the 95.8% (n = 4,847) who had a registry- or chart-reported disease-causing CFTR genotype. Of the remaining 98 individuals, 78 carried one variant that has been associated with CF (CF-causing [n = 70] or resulting in varying clinical consequences n = 8]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nComplete CFTR gene sequencing in 5,058 individuals with CF identified at least one DNA variant in 99.6% of the cohort that is targetable by current molecular or emerging gene-based therapeutic technologies.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31036917\">Title: Sequencing as a first-line methodology for cystic fibrosis carrier screening.\nAuthors: Beauchamp, Kyle A, Johansen Taber, Katherine A, Grauman, Peter V et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics\nAbstract: PURPOSE\nMedical society guidelines recommend offering genotyping-based cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening to pregnant women or women considering pregnancy. We assessed the performance of sequencing-based CF screening relative to genotyping, in terms of analytical validity, clinical validity, clinical impact, and clinical utility.\nMETHODS\nAnalytical validity was assessed using orthogonal confirmation and reference samples. Clinical validity was evaluated using the CFTR2 database. Clinical impact was assessed using ~100,000 screened patients. Three screening strategies were compared: genotyping 23 guideline-recommended variants (\"CF23\"), sequencing all coding bases in CFTR (\"NGS\"), and sequencing with large copy-number variant (CNV) identification (\"NGS + CNV\"). Clinical utility was determined via self-reported actions of at-risk couples (ARCs).\nRESULTS\nAnalytical accuracy of NGS + CNV was 100% for SNVs, indels, and CNVs; interpretive clinical specificity relative to CFTR2 was 99.5%. NGS + CNV detected 58 ARCs, 18 of whom would have gone undetected with CF23 alone. Most ARCs (89% screened preconceptionally, 56% prenatally) altered pregnancy management, and no significant differences were observed between ARCs with or without at least one non-CF23 variant.\nCONCLUSION\nModern NGS and variant interpretation enable accurate sequencing-based CF screening. Limiting screening to 23 variants does not improve analytical validity, clinical validity, or clinical utility, but does fail to detect approximately 30% (18/58) of ARCs.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32172930\">Title: Variant classifications, databases and genotype-phenotype correlations.\nAuthors: Raynal, C, Corvol, H | Year: 2020 | Journal: Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie\nAbstract: Because CFTR gene studies now represent one of the most frequent genetic analyses routinely performed worldwide, the number of rare CFTR variants identified in various clinical situations, regularly increases. To provide appropriate diagnosis and prognosis to CF patients as well as appropriate genetic counseling to families, the clinical impact and the phenotypic spectrum of variants identified by diagnostic techniques need to be characterized. Three complementary locus specific databases, called CFTR1, CFTR2 and CFTR-France were developed to address these issues. Besides, the growing knowledge of the CF pathophysiology and the technical evolution in molecular biology allowed to identify candidate modifier genes, regulatory loci, epigenetic profiles and trans-regulators that could help to refine genotype-phenotype correlations at the individual level. These different factors may contribute to the large phenotypic variability between patients with CF, even when they carry identical CFTR variants, regarding lung function, meconium ileus susceptibility or the risk for developing CFTR-related diabetes and liver disease. Finally, the availability of new therapies that target the CFTR protein for numbers of CF patients led to the identification of 'good' and 'poor' responders, thus raising questions of pharmacogenetics factors that may influence treatment efficiency as a novel feature of the complexity of CF patients' management. © 2020 French Society of Pediatrics.

Phenotype and genotype information on approximately 40,000 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were collected from registries and large clinics. The disease-liability of the 160 most frequently reported mutations was evaluated by means of a multistage process which involved clinical (sweat chloride average), functional (expression in cell-based systems) and epidemiological (mutation analysis in obligate heterozygotes) steps. The results of this analysis can be consulted in a dedicated website. Data originated by CFTR2 may be valuable in several facets of CF care, including diagnosis, newborn screening, carrier testing, genotype/phenotype correlation and mutation-specific therapeutics.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35184981\">Title: How the sweat gland reveals levels of CFTR activity.\nAuthors: Wine, Jeffrey J | Year: 2022 | Journal: Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society\nAbstract: CFTR is an anion channel that causes cystic fibrosis (CF) when its activity, equal to channel number x open probability x conductance (n·P O ·γ) is absent or nearly so. CFTR modulators increase CFTR activity, but estimates of in vivo efficacy vary. This review shows how values from the simple and widely used sweat chloride test can be calibrated to provide more accurate estimates of CFTR activity as a percent of the average for healthy control (HC) subjects (hereafter 'CFTR activity'). Sweating stimulated by β-adrenergic agonists (β-sweat) is rate-limited by CFTR, producing a near linear, ratio scale of CFTR activity with carriers = 50% and CF = 0% of HC values set = 100%, but the β-sweat assay is difficult to use. Here, sweat chloride is calibrated to CFTR activity by plotting mean sweat chloride values, taken from numerous studies and the CFTR2 database against mean β-sweat rates for CF, carriers and HC. The resulting inverse logarithmic relations indicate that sweat chloride values ≥60 mmol/L occur when CFTR activity is below 1.2% -10% of HC. These are lower than most previous estimates, which resulted from setting nasal potential difference (NPD) as linear rather than logarithmic measures of CFTR activity. Features of the sweat gland coil and duct are used to explain why readouts of CFTR activity are linear for β-sweat and logarithmic for sweat chloride. Sweat chloride values fall steeply for small increments of CFTR activity above zero-the most clinically relevant region. Thus, large health benefits can be achieved by restoring low levels of CFTR activity, especially if this is done before irreversible lung damage.

Few of the almost 2,000 variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene CFTR have empirical evidence that they cause cystic fibrosis. To address this gap, we collected both genotype and phenotype data for 39,696 individuals with cystic fibrosis in registries and clinics in North America and Europe.

These variants were evaluated for both clinical severity and functional consequence, with 127 (80%) meeting both clinical and functional criteria consistent with disease.

Few of the almost 2,000 variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene CFTR have empirical evidence that they cause cystic fibrosis. To address this gap, we collected both genotype and phenotype data for 39,696 individuals with cystic fibrosis in registries and clinics in North America and Europe. In these individuals, 159 CFTR variants had an allele frequency of ł0.01%. These variants were evaluated for both clinical severity and functional consequence, with 127 (80%) meeting both clinical and functional criteria consistent with disease. Assessment of disease penetrance in 2,188 fathers of individuals with cystic fibrosis enabled assignment of 12 of the remaining 32 variants as neutral, whereas the other 20 variants remained of indeterminate effect. This study illustrates that sourcing data directly from well-phenotyped subjects can address the gap in our ability to interpret clinically relevant genomic variation. \n##  Publication types \n  * Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural \n  * Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't \n\n\n##  MeSH terms \n  * Cystic Fibrosis / genetics* \n  * Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator / genetics* \n  * Female \n  * Gene Frequency \n  * Genotype \n  * Humans \n  * Male \n  * Phenotype \n\n\n##  Substances \n  * CFTR protein, human \n  * Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator \n\n\n##  Grants and funding \n  * 5R37DK044003/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \n  * T32 HL072748/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States \n  * R01 DK049835/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \n  * DK49835/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \n  * R37 DK044003/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \n  * R37 DK049835/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \n  * R01 DK044003/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \n\n\n", "fit_markdown": "", "html": null, "error": null}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:33:55.261333"}, {"tool_name": "google_search", "parameters": {}, "query": "23974870 CFTR2 genotype distribution F508del homozygous percentage", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"searchParameters\": {\"q\": \"23974870 CFTR2 genotype distribution F508del homozygous percentage\", \"gl\": \"us\", \"hl\": \"en\", \"type\": \"search\", \"num\": 10, \"engine\": \"google\"}, \"organic\": [{\"title\": \"VCV000007105.196 - ClinVar - NCBI - NIH\", \"link\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7105\", \"snippet\": \"Phe508del) variant, also known as delta508, has been reported in the homozygous or trans heterozygous state in many individuals affected with cystic fibrosis ...Read more\", \"position\": 1}, {\"title\": \"(PDF) Genetic Heterogeneity Correlated with Phenotypic ...\", \"link\": \"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394094174_Genetic_Heterogeneity_Correlated_with_Phenotypic_Variability_in_48_Patients_with_Cystic_Fibrosis\", \"snippet\": \"The F508del variant was the most frequent (69.79%), followed by G542X (6.25%, 6/96).

The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.\nRESULTS\nFor this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

Those trial participants with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <92% on air or requiring oxygen therapy) and evidence of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein ≥75 mg/L) were eligible for random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to usual standard of care alone versus usual standard of care plus tocilizumab at a dose of 400 mg-800 mg (depending on weight) given intravenously. A second dose could be given 12-24 h later if the patient's condition had not improved. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936).\nFINDINGS\nBetween April 23, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021, 4116 adults of 21 550 patients enrolled into the RECOVERY trial were included in the assessment of tocilizumab, including 3385 (82%) patients receiving systemic corticosteroids. Overall, 621 (31%) of the 2022 patients allocated tocilizumab and 729 (35%) of the 2094 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0·85; 95% CI 0·76-0·94; p=0·0028). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including those receiving systemic corticosteroids. Patients allocated to tocilizumab were more likely to be discharged from hospital within 28 days (57% vs 50%; rate ratio 1·22; 1·12-1·33; p<0·0001). Among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, patients allocated tocilizumab were less likely to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (35% vs 42%; risk ratio 0·84; 95% CI 0·77-0·92; p<0·0001).\nINTERPRETATION\nIn hospitalised COVID-19 patients with hypoxia and systemic inflammation, tocilizumab improved survival and other clinical outcomes. These benefits were seen regardless of the amount of respiratory support and were additional to the benefits of systemic corticosteroids.\nFUNDING\nUK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40406130\">Title: Management of immune-related myocarditis, myositis and myasthenia gravis (MMM) overlap syndrome: a single institution case series and literature review.\nAuthors: Sánchez-Camacho, Alberto, Torres-Zurita, Alberto, Gallego-López, Laura et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Frontiers in immunology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of various malignancies, particularly melanoma. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) pose significant challenges, particularly in cases of severe toxicity syndromes. One such life-threatening irAE is the myocarditis, myositis, and myasthenia gravis (MMM) overlap syndrome, which occurs in less than 1% of patients but has in-hospital mortality rates ranging from 40 to 60%. Due to its rarity and complexity, early recognition and a multidisciplinary approach are critical to improving outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe present a single-institution case series of four patients diagnosed with MMM overlap syndrome following ICI therapy. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging, and electrophysiological tests were analyzed to confirm the diagnosis. Therapeutic interventions-including corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange (PLEX), tocilizumab, and rituximab- were evaluated in terms of efficacy and clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS\nThe onset of MMM syndrome varied from 2 to 4 weeks after initiating ICI therapy. Patients presented with rapidly progressive symptoms, including ptosis, bulbar dysfunction, respiratory distress, myopathy, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated in all cases. Additional immunomodulatory treatments (IVIG, tocilizumab, PLEX, and rituximab) were administered based on clinical deterioration and autoimmune profile. Two patients achieved complete recovery, one remains on maintenance immunosuppression, and one died due to respiratory failure despite aggressive treatment.\nCONCLUSION\nMMM overlap syndrome is a severe and often fatal irAE associated with ICI therapy. Early identification, aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, and individualized therapeutic strategies are essential to optimize patient outcomes. Further research is needed to refine diagnostic criteria, identify predictive biomarkers, and establish standardized treatment protocols.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35908569\">Title: Baricitinib in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial and updated meta-analysis.\nAuthors:  | Year: 2022 | Journal: Lancet (London, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nWe aimed to evaluate the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1-2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nThis randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was done, which included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381936) and is ongoing.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Feb 2 and Dec 29, 2021, from 10 852 enrolled, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% were receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 h recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 514 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0·87; 95% CI 0·77-0·99; p=0·028). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of eight previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths), in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0·57; 95% CI 0·45-0·72). Including the results from RECOVERY in an updated meta-analysis of all nine completed trials (involving 11 888 randomly assigned patients and 1485 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or another JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0·80; 95% CI 0·72-0·89; p<0·0001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no significant excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn patients hospitalised with COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.\nFUNDING\nUK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council) and National Institute of Health Research.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32929488\">Title: Flotetuzumab as salvage immunotherapy for refractory acute myeloid leukemia.\nAuthors: Uy, Geoffrey L, Aldoss, Ibrahim, Foster, Matthew C et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Blood\nAbstract: Approximately 50% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients do not respond to induction therapy (primary induction failure [PIF]) or relapse after <6 months (early relapse [ER]). We have recently shown an association between an immune-infiltrated tumor microenvironment (TME) and resistance to cytarabine-based chemotherapy but responsiveness to flotetuzumab, a bispecific DART antibody-based molecule to CD3ε and CD123. This paper reports the results of a multicenter, open-label, phase 1/2 study of flotetuzumab in 88 adults with relapsed/refractory AML: 42 in a dose-finding segment and 46 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 500 ng/kg per day. The most frequent adverse events were infusion-related reactions (IRRs)/cytokine release syndrome (CRS), largely grade 1-2. Stepwise dosing during week 1, pretreatment dexamethasone, prompt use of tocilizumab, and temporary dose reductions/interruptions successfully prevented severe IRR/CRS. Clinical benefit accrued to PIF/ER patients showing an immune-infiltrated TME. Among 30 PIF/ER patients treated at the RP2D, the complete remission (CR)/CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh) rate was 26.7%, with an overall response rate (CR/CRh/CR with incomplete hematological recovery) of 30.0%. In PIF/ER patients who achieved CR/CRh, median overall survival was 10.2 months (range, 1.87-27.27), with 6- and 12-month survival rates of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.450-1.05) and 50% (95% CI, 0.154-0.846). Bone marrow transcriptomic analysis showed that a parsimonious 10-gene signature predicted CRs to flotetuzumab (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.904 vs 0.672 for the European LeukemiaNet classifier). Flotetuzumab represents an innovative experimental approach associated with acceptable safety and encouraging evidence of activity in PIF/ER patients.

Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours after starting organ support in the intensive care unit (ICU), were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight), sarilumab (400 mg), or standard care (control). The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support-free days, on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with predefined criteria for superiority, efficacy, equivalence, or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both.\nRESULTS\nBoth tocilizumab and sarilumab met the predefined criteria for efficacy. At that time, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, and 402 to control. The median number of organ support-free days was 10 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) in the tocilizumab group, 11 (interquartile range, 0 to 16) in the sarilumab group, and 0 (interquartile range, -1 to 15) in the control group. The median adjusted cumulative odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95% credible interval, 1.17 to 2.91) for sarilumab as compared with control, yielding posterior probabilities of superiority to control of more than 99.9% and of 99.5%, respectively. An analysis of 90-day survival showed improved survival in the pooled interleukin-6 receptor antagonist groups, yielding a hazard ratio for the comparison with the control group of 1.61 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.08) and a posterior probability of superiority of more than 99.9%.

Eight trials were included. No one was in favour for controlled arm about main endpoint of death or mechanical ventilation incidence at day 28-30. Five trials on heterogenous populations seem to not demonstrate tocilizumab efficacy, but showed encouraging results in subgroup analysis on severe/critical patients (in favour for tocilizumab). Trials on severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia as REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY showed mortality benefit of tocilizumab administration; CORIMUNO, REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY showed that tocilizumab decreased the incidence of mechanical ventilation. No safety signal about tocilizumab used was noticed in all trials. We concluded that tocilizumab reduces mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement if administered with the right timing in COVID-19 pneumonia. The challenge now is to define the optimal group and timing for tocilizumab benefit and we suggest that: (i) tocilizumab has a place in treatment of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia, with a high level of O 2 flow or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula; (ii) possibly early after intubation in patients on mechanical ventilation. Initiating tocilizumab in critically ill patients early before irreversible respiratory failure, especially in patients at an inflammatory stage could be the key to successful outcome.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34894345\">Title: Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Considerations of Alternate Dosing Strategies of Tocilizumab in COVID-19.\nAuthors: Leung, Elizabeth, Crass, Ryan L, Jorgensen, Sarah C J et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Clinical pharmacokinetics\nAbstract: Tocilizumab is one of few treatments that have been shown to improve mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but increased demand has led to relative global shortages. Recently, it has been suggested that lower doses, or fixed doses, of tocilizumab could be a potential solution to conserve the limited global supply while conferring equivalent therapeutic benefit to the dosing regimens studied in major trials. The relationship between tocilizumab dose, exposure, and response in COVID-19 has not been adequately characterized. There are a number of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters that likely differ between patients with severe COVID-19 and patients in whom tocilizumab was studied during the US FDA approval process. Likewise, it is unclear whether a threshold exposure is necessary for tocilizumab efficacy. The safety and efficacy of fixed versus weight-based dosing of tocilizumab has been evaluated outside of COVID-19, but it is uncertain if these observations are generalizable to severe or critical COVID-19. In the current review, we consider the potential advantages and limitations of alternative tocilizumab dosing strategies. Leveraging PK models and simulation analyses, we demonstrate that a fixed single dose of tocilizumab 400 mg is unlikely to produce PK exposures equivalent to those achieved in the REMAP-CAP trial, although weight-stratified dosing appears to produce more uniform exposure distribution. Data from current and future trials could provide PK/pharmacodynamic insight to better inform dosing strategies at the bedside. Ultimately, rational dosing strategies that balance available limited supply with patient needs are required.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33915284\">Title: Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients: a living systematic review and meta-analysis, first update.\nAuthors: Tleyjeh, Imad M, Kashour, Zakariya, Riaz, Muhammad et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nCytokine release syndrome with elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels is associated with multiorgan damage and death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to update the data in a living systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy and toxicity of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients.\nMETHODS\nData sources were Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google from 8th October 2020 till 24th February 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. The participants were hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and intervention was tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs with a random effects model and evaluated inconsistency between studies with I 2 . We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.\nRESULTS\nOf 1600 citations, eight RCTs and 28 cohorts were eligible. The eight RCTs had low risk of bias, and with 6311 patients they examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 0.91 (95%CI 0.78-1.07, I 2 25%). Only the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials, with the majority of their patients on concomitant corticosteroids, showed lower 30-day mortality with tocilizumab use: RR 0.74 (95%CI 0.59-0.93) and 0.89 (95%CI 0.81-0.97), respectively. Seven RCTs, with 5391 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.84 (95%CI 0.76-0.93), I 2 0%, with a corresponding number needed to treat of 20 (95%CI 14.3-33.3). Eight RCTs, with 5340 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on a composite of poor outcome; pooled RR was 0.82 (95%CI 0.76-0.90, I 2 3%). Data from the RCTs showed a lower risk of infections and no higher risk of serious adverse events with tocilizumab: pooled RR 0.67 (95%CI 0.45-0.99, eight RCTs) and 0.85 (95%CI 0.63-1.16, seven RCTs), respectively. Among 28 cohorts with 15 484 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.53 (95%CI 0.43-0.67, I 2 76%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nCumulative high-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of poor outcome and the risk of secondary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This review will continuously evaluate the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 treatment.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35802687\">Title: Association between tocilizumab, sarilumab and all-cause mortality at 28 days in hospitalised patients with COVID-19: A network meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Godolphin, Peter J, Fisher, David J, Berry, Lindsay R et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: PloS one\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nA recent prospective meta-analysis demonstrated that interleukin-6 antagonists are associated with lower all-cause mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, compared with usual care or placebo. However, emerging evidence suggests that clinicians are favouring the use of tocilizumab over sarilumab. A new randomised comparison of these agents from the REMAP-CAP trial shows similar effects on in-hospital mortality. Therefore, we initiated a network meta-analysis, to estimate pairwise associations between tocilizumab, sarilumab and usual care or placebo with 28-day mortality, in COVID-19 patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and ventilation, based on all available direct and indirect evidence.\nMETHODS\nEligible trials randomised hospitalised patients with COVID-19 that compared tocilizumab or sarilumab with usual care or placebo in the prospective meta-analysis or that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab. Data were restricted to patients receiving corticosteroids and either non-invasive or invasive ventilation at randomisation. Pairwise associations between tocilizumab, sarilumab and usual care or placebo for all-cause mortality 28 days after randomisation were estimated using a frequentist contrast-based network meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs), implementing multivariate fixed-effects models that assume consistency between the direct and indirect evidence.\nFINDINGS\nOne trial (REMAP-CAP) was identified that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab and supplied results on all-cause mortality at 28-days. This network meta-analysis was based on 898 eligible patients (278 deaths) from REMAP-CAP and 3710 eligible patients from 18 trials (1278 deaths) from the prospective meta-analysis. Summary ORs were similar for tocilizumab [0·82 [0·71-0·95, p = 0·008]] and sarilumab [0·80 [0·61-1·04, p = 0·09]] compared with usual care or placebo. The summary OR for 28-day mortality comparing tocilizumab with sarilumab was 1·03 [95%CI 0·81-1·32, p = 0·80]. The p-value for the global test of inconsistency was 0·28.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdministration of either tocilizumab or sarilumab was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality compared with usual care or placebo. The association is not dependent on the choice of interleukin-6 receptor antagonist.</snippet>\n</tool_output>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbim.nih.gov/33933206/", "result": {"error": "Error calling tool 'crawl4ai_docker_fetch_webpage_content': Server error 500: Crawl request failed: Unexpected error in _crawl_web at line 696 in _crawl_web (../usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/crawl4ai/async_crawler_strategy.py):\nError: Failed on navigating ACS-GOTO:\nPage.goto: net::ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED at https://pubmed.ncbim.nih.gov/33933206/\nCall log:\n  - navigating to \"https://pubmed.ncbim.nih.gov/33933206/\", waiting until \"domcontentloaded\"\n\n\nCode context:\n 691                               tag=\"GOTO\",\n 692                               params={\"url\": url},\n 693                           )\n 694                           response = None\n 695                       else:\n 696 →                         raise RuntimeError(f\"Failed on navigating ACS-GOTO:\\n{str(e)}\")\n 697   \n 698                   await self.execute_hook(\n 699                       \"after_goto\", page, context=context, url=url, response=response, config=config\n 700                   )\n 701   "}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:35:46.998061"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "RECOVERY tocilizumab 33933206 mortality", "result": {"total": 79, "data": [{"paperId": "29385370", "title": "Tisagenlecleucel in Children and Young Adults with B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a single-center phase 1-2a study, the anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel produced high rates of complete remission and was associated with serious but mainly reversible toxic effects in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL.

Ultimately, rational dosing strategies that balance available limited supply with patient needs are required.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Clinical pharmacokinetics"}, {"paperId": "33915284", "title": "Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients: a living systematic review and meta-analysis, first update.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nCytokine release syndrome with elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels is associated with multiorgan damage and death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to update the data in a living systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy and toxicity of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients.\nMETHODS\nData sources were Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google from 8th October 2020 till 24th February 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. The participants were hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and intervention was tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs with a random effects model and evaluated inconsistency between studies with I 2 . We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.\nRESULTS\nOf 1600 citations, eight RCTs and 28 cohorts were eligible. The eight RCTs had low risk of bias, and with 6311 patients they examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 0.91 (95%CI 0.78-1.07, I 2 25%). Only the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials, with the majority of their patients on concomitant corticosteroids, showed lower 30-day mortality with tocilizumab use: RR 0.74 (95%CI 0.59-0.93) and 0.89 (95%CI 0.81-0.97), respectively. Seven RCTs, with 5391 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.84 (95%CI 0.76-0.93), I 2 0%, with a corresponding number needed to treat of 20 (95%CI 14.3-33.3). Eight RCTs, with 5340 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on a composite of poor outcome; pooled RR was 0.82 (95%CI 0.76-0.90, I 2 3%). Data from the RCTs showed a lower risk of infections and no higher risk of serious adverse events with tocilizumab: pooled RR 0.67 (95%CI 0.45-0.99, eight RCTs) and 0.85 (95%CI 0.63-1.16, seven RCTs), respectively. Among 28 cohorts with 15 484 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.53 (95%CI 0.43-0.67, I 2 76%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nCumulative high-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of poor outcome and the risk of secondary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

However, emerging evidence suggests that clinicians are favouring the use of tocilizumab over sarilumab. A new randomised comparison of these agents from the REMAP-CAP trial shows similar effects on in-hospital mortality. Therefore, we initiated a network meta-analysis, to estimate pairwise associations between tocilizumab, sarilumab and usual care or placebo with 28-day mortality, in COVID-19 patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and ventilation, based on all available direct and indirect evidence.\nMETHODS\nEligible trials randomised hospitalised patients with COVID-19 that compared tocilizumab or sarilumab with usual care or placebo in the prospective meta-analysis or that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab. Data were restricted to patients receiving corticosteroids and either non-invasive or invasive ventilation at randomisation. Pairwise associations between tocilizumab, sarilumab and usual care or placebo for all-cause mortality 28 days after randomisation were estimated using a frequentist contrast-based network meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs), implementing multivariate fixed-effects models that assume consistency between the direct and indirect evidence.\nFINDINGS\nOne trial (REMAP-CAP) was identified that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab and supplied results on all-cause mortality at 28-days. This network meta-analysis was based on 898 eligible patients (278 deaths) from REMAP-CAP and 3710 eligible patients from 18 trials (1278 deaths) from the prospective meta-analysis. Summary ORs were similar for tocilizumab [0·82 [0·71-0·95, p = 0·008]] and sarilumab [0·80 [0·61-1·04, p = 0·09]] compared with usual care or placebo. The summary OR for 28-day mortality comparing tocilizumab with sarilumab was 1·03 [95%CI 0·81-1·32, p = 0·80]. The p-value for the global test of inconsistency was 0·28.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdministration of either tocilizumab or sarilumab was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality compared with usual care or placebo.

The primary objective of Part 1 is to demonstrate that semaglutide improves liver histology compared with placebo. The two primary endpoints are: resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis, and improvement in liver fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis. The Part 2 objective is based on clinical outcomes. The current work reports baseline characteristics of the first 800 randomised participants which includes demographics, laboratory parameters, liver histology, non-invasive tests and presence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) cardiometabolic criteria.\nRESULTS\nOf 800 participants, 250 (31.3%) had fibrosis stage 2 and 550 (68.8%) had fibrosis stage 3. In the overall population, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 56 (11.6) years, 57.1% were female, mean (SD) body mass index was 34.6 (7.2) kg/m 2 , 55.5% had type 2 diabetes and > 99% had at least one MASLD cardiometabolic criterion according to the published definition.\nCONCLUSION\nThe ESSENCE baseline population includes participants with clinically significant fibrosis stages 2 and 3. Although MASLD cardiometabolic criteria were not a requirement for study enrolment, almost all participants (> 99%) had at least one MASLD cardiometabolic criterion.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nNCT04822181.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33185364\">Title: A Placebo-Controlled Trial of Subcutaneous Semaglutide in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.\nAuthors: Newsome, Philip N, Buchholtz, Kristine, Cusi, Kenneth et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common disease that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but treatment options are limited. The efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in patients with NASH is not known.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a 72-week, double-blind phase 2 trial involving patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis of stage F1, F2, or F3. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 3:3:3:1:1:1 ratio, to receive once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg or corresponding placebo. The primary end point was resolution of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis. The confirmatory secondary end point was an improvement of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of NASH. The analyses of these end points were performed only in patients with stage F2 or F3 fibrosis; other analyses were performed in all the patients.\nRESULTS\nIn total, 320 patients (of whom 230 had stage F2 or F3 fibrosis) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide at a dose of 0.1 mg (80 patients), 0.2 mg (78 patients), or 0.4 mg (82 patients) or to receive placebo (80 patients). The percentage of patients in whom NASH resolution was achieved with no worsening of fibrosis was 40% in the 0.1-mg group, 36% in the 0.2-mg group, 59% in the 0.4-mg group, and 17% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for semaglutide 0.4 mg vs. placebo). An improvement in fibrosis stage occurred in 43% of the patients in the 0.4-mg group and in 33% of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.48). The mean percent weight loss was 13% in the 0.4-mg group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of nausea, constipation, and vomiting was higher in the 0.4-mg group than in the placebo group (nausea, 42% vs. 11%; constipation, 22% vs. 12%; and vomiting, 15% vs. 2%). Malignant neoplasms were reported in 3 patients who received semaglutide (1%) and in no patients who received placebo. Overall, neoplasms (benign, malignant, or unspecified) were reported in 15% of the patients in the semaglutide groups and in 8% in the placebo group; no pattern of occurrence in specific organs was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis phase 2 trial involving patients with NASH showed that treatment with semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with NASH resolution than placebo. However, the trial did not show a significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with an improvement in fibrosis stage.

The results of a planned interim analysis conducted at week 72 involving the first 800 patients are reported here (part 1). The primary end points for part 1 were the resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of liver fibrosis and reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis.\nRESULTS\nResolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 62.9% of the 534 patients in the semaglutide group and in 34.3% of the 266 patients in the placebo group (estimated difference, 28.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21.1 to 36.2; P<0.001). A reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis was reported in 36.8% of the patients in the semaglutide group and in 22.4% of those in the placebo group (estimated difference, 14.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 21.3; P<0.001). Results for the three secondary outcomes that were included in the plan to adjust for multiple testing were as follows: combined resolution of steatohepatitis and reduction in liver fibrosis was reported in 32.7% of the patients in the semaglutide group and in 16.1% of those in the placebo group (estimated difference, 16.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.2 to 22.8; P<0.001). The mean change in body weight was -10.5% with semaglutide and -2.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -8.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.6 to -7.4; P<0.001). Mean changes in bodily pain scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the semaglutide group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with MASH and moderate or advanced liver fibrosis, once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg improved liver histologic results.

Gastroenterology & hepatology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nPatients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis are at high risk of liver-related and all-cause morbidity and mortality. We investigated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue semaglutide in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.\nMETHODS\nThis double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial enrolled patients from 38 centres in Europe and the USA. Adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH-related cirrhosis and body-mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m 2 or more were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg or visually matching placebo. Patients were randomly allocated via an interactive web response system, stratified by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an improvement in liver fibrosis of one stage or more without worsening of NASH after 48 weeks, assessed by biopsy in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is closed and completed, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03987451.\nFINDINGS\n71 patients were enrolled between June 18, 2019, and April 22, 2021; 49 (69%) patients were female and 22 (31%) were male. Patients had a mean age of 59·5 years (SD 8·0) and mean BMI of 34·9 kg/m 2 (SD 5·9); 53 (75%) patients had diabetes. 47 patients were randomly assigned to the semaglutide group and 24 to the placebo group. After 48 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients with an improvement in liver fibrosis of one stage or more without worsening of NASH (five [11%] of 47 patients in the semaglutide group vs seven [29%] of 24 in the placebo group; odds ratio 0·28 [95% CI 0·06-1·24; p=0·087). There was also no significant difference between groups in the proportion of patients who achieved NASH resolution (p=0·29). Similar proportions of patients in each group reported adverse events (42 [89%] patients in the semaglutide group vs 19 [79%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (six [13%] vs two [8%]). The most common adverse events were nausea (21 [45%] vs four [17%]), diarrhoea (nine [19%] vs two [8%]), and vomiting (eight [17%] vs none). Hepatic and renal function remained stable. There were no decompensating events or deaths.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis, semaglutide did not significantly improve fibrosis or achievement of NASH resolution versus placebo.

Here, we profiled monotherapy with semaglutide (glucagon-like-receptor-1 receptor agonist) and lanifibranor (pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist) in a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model of NASH-HCC. Disease progression was characterized in male C57BL/6 J mice fed the GAN (Gubra Amylin NASH) diet high in fat, fructose and cholesterol for 12-72 weeks (n = 15 per group). Other GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice fed the GAN diet for 54 weeks and with biopsy-confirmed NASH (NAFLD Activity Score ≥ 5) and advanced fibrosis (stage F3) received vehicle (n = 16), semaglutide (30 nmol/kg, s.c., n = 15), or lanifibranor (30 mg/kg, p.o., n = 15) once daily for 14 weeks. GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice demonstrated progressive NASH, fibrosis and HCC burden. Tumors presented with histological and molecular signatures of poor prognostic HCC. Consistent with clinical trial outcomes in NASH patients, both lanifibranor and semaglutide improved NASH while only lanifibranor reduced fibrosis in GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice. Notably, only semaglutide reduced tumor burden in GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice. In conclusion, the GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mouse is a clinical translational model of NASH-HCC. Semaglutide improves both NASH and tumor burden in GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice, highlighting the suitability of this preclinical model for profiling novel drug therapies targeting NASH-HCC.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">25601265 FLINT obeticholic fibrosis improvement</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 9 results.

A myriad of pathways and genetic influence contribute to NASH pathogenesis and liver disease progression. Diagnosing patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis is critical prior to treatment and prognostication. There has been ongoing interest in developing non-invasive biomarkers and tools for identifying NASH and advanced fibrosis. To date, there has been no approved therapy for NASH. Recently, the FLINT (Farnesoid X Receptor [FXR] Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment) trial provided promising results of the efficacy of obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, in improving histological features of NASH and fibrosis. Long-term studies are needed to assess the safety of obeticholic acid and its effects on liver- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30253043\">Title: Relationship between three commonly used non-invasive fibrosis biomarkers and improvement in fibrosis stage in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nAuthors: Chalasani, Naga, Abdelmalek, Manal F, Loomba, Rohit et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver\nAbstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS\nNon-invasive biomarkers are needed for monitoring changes in liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Obeticholic acid (OCA) was shown to improve fibrosis in patients with NASH in the FLINT trial; a post hoc analysis of these data was performed to determine the relationship between 3 non-invasive fibrosis markers and liver fibrosis improvement.\nMETHODS\nIn the Phase 2b FLINT trial, patients were randomised (1:1) to receive 25 mg OCA or placebo once daily for 72 weeks. Aspartate aminotransferase:platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) were evaluated in serum at baseline and weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96. Liver biopsies were obtained at baseline and 72 weeks.\nRESULTS\nIn patients with fibrosis improvement at week 24, scores were reduced by a median of 34% for APRI, 10% for FIB-4 and 4% for NFS. Reductions in APRI (P = 0.015) and FIB-4 (P = 0.036), but not NFS (P = 0.201) at week 24, significantly correlated with ≥1-stage improvement in histologic fibrosis at week 72. Reductions in APRI at week 72 were significantly correlated with fibrosis improvement at week 72 (P = 0.012). Patients receiving OCA had significant reductions in all markers compared with patients receiving placebo at week 72 [APRI and FIB-4 (P < 0.0001); NFS (P < 0.05)].\nCONCLUSIONS\nReadily available non-invasive markers may predict improvement in liver fibrosis in patients with NASH. Upon external confirmation and further refinement in larger populations, these markers may serve as surrogate endpoints in NASH clinical trials.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27895393\">Title: Emerging role of obeticholic acid in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAuthors: Makri, Evangelia, Cholongitas, Evangelos, Tziomalos, Konstantinos | Year: 2016 | Journal: World journal of gastroenterology\nAbstract: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest chronic liver disease and its prevalence is increasing driven by the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic acid (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35903833\">Title: Association of changes in histologic severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and changes in patient-reported quality of life.\nAuthors: Heath, Laura, Aveyard, Paul, Tomlinson, Jeremy W et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Hepatology communications\nAbstract: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent chronic disease that is associated with a spectrum of liver fibrosis and can lead to cirrhosis. Patients with NASH report lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than the general population. It remains uncertain how changes in histologic severity are associated with changes in HRQoL. This is a secondary analysis of the Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment (FLINT) and Pioglitazone, Vitamin E, or Placebo for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) randomized controlled trials in patients with biopsy-proven NASH. HRQoL was assessed using short form-36 at baseline and at follow-up biopsy (at 72 and 96 weeks, respectively). Adjusted linear regression models were used to examine the association between changes in liver fibrosis (primary analysis), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (secondary analysis), and changes in HRQoL scores. Compared with stable fibrosis, improvement of fibrosis by at least one stage was significantly associated with improvements only in the physical function component by 1.8 points (95% confidence interval, 0.1, 3.5). Worsening of fibrosis by at least one stage was not associated with statistically significant changes in any HRQoL domain compared with stable fibrosis. Associations between HRQoL and NAFLD disease activity score in the secondary analysis were of similar magnitude. Weight loss was associated with small improvements in physical function, general health, and energy levels. Conclusion: Improvements in fibrosis stage were associated with improvements in the physical component of HRQoL, but the clinical impact was modest. As improving fibrosis may not meaningfully improve well-being, treatment for NASH will be cost effective only if it prevents long-term hepatic and cardiovascular disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30549292\">Title: Improvements in Histologic Features and Diagnosis Associated With Improvement in Fibrosis in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Results From the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network Treatment Trials.\nAuthors: Brunt, Elizabeth M, Kleiner, David E, Wilson, Laura A et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)\nAbstract: Hepatocellular injury and inflammation are believed to be the primary drivers of fibrogenesis that ultimately lead to cirrhosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study sought associations between observed improvements in fibrosis with improvement in specific histologic features, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) ≥2, diagnostic category, and primary histologically based outcomes of two adult NASH treatment trials. The primary outcome for the study was fibrosis improvement from baseline to end of treatment, defined as a 1-point or more improvement in fibrosis stage. This is a retrospective analysis of biopsy data collected from the NASH Clinical Research Network Pathology Committee of Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with NASH Trial (PIVENS) and Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment Trial (FLINT) baseline and final biopsies. Treatment group-adjusted univariable and multivariable logistic regression models related improvement in fibrosis to improvements in other histologic variables, resolution of steatohepatitis, and improvement in the NAS ≥2. In PIVENS 221 subjects had baseline and 96-week biopsies, and in FLINT 200 subjects had baseline and 72-week biopsies. Improvement in fibrosis was found in 38% of PIVENS and 29% of FLINT biopsies; fibrosis improvement was more likely in treated than placebo subjects in both studies. Controlling for treatment group, fibrosis improvement was associated most strongly with resolution of NASH (PIVENS, odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-7.6; P < 0.001; FLINT, OR, 8.0; 95% CI 3.1-20.9; P < 0.001), and improved NAS by ≥2 (PIVENS, OR, 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.3; P = 0.003; FLINT, OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.3; P < 0.001). Improvement in histologic features associated with improved fibrosis for both studies included steatosis, ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies, and portal, but not lobular, inflammation. Conclusion: These findings support a strong link between histologic resolution of steatohepatitis with improvement in fibrosis in NASH.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25601265/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">FLINT trial obeticholic fibrosis improved</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 9 results.

We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nMETHODS\nWe did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the USA in patients with non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to assess treatment with obeticholic acid given orally (25 mg daily) or placebo for 72 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01265498.\nFINDINGS\nBetween March 16, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 141 patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic acid and 142 to placebo. 50 (45%) of 110 patients in the obeticholic acid group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and 72 weeks had improved liver histology compared with 23 (21%) of 109 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 2·8; p=0·0002). 33 (23%) of 141 patients in the obeticholic acid developed pruritus compared with nine (6%) of 142 in the placebo group.\nINTERPRETATION\nObeticholic acid improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification.\nFUNDING\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Intercept Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25926979\">Title: Recent advances in understanding/management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nAuthors: Pacana, Tommy, Sanyal, Arun J | Year: 2015 | Journal: F1000prime reports\nAbstract: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to advanced fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.

NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD.

In this context, obeticholic acid (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation.

There are limited multicenter data comparing an active drug versus placebo on the association between the quantity of liver fat reduction assessed by MRI-PDFF and histologic response in NASH. This study aims to examine the association between 30% relative reduction in MRI-PDFF and histologic response in obeticholic acid (OCA) versus placebo-treated patients in the FLINT (farnesoid X receptor ligand obeticholic acid in NASH trial).\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS\nThis is a secondary analysis of the FLINT trial including 78 patients with MRI-PDFF measured before and after treatment along with paired liver histology assessment. Histologic response was defined as a 2-point improvement in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score without worsening of fibrosis. OCA (25 mg orally once daily) was better than placebo in improving MRI-PDFF by an absolute difference of -3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -6.5 to -0.2%, P value = 0.04) and relative difference of -17% (95% CI, -34 to 0%, P value = 0.05). The optimal cutoff point for relative decline in MRI-PDFF for histologic response was 30% (using Youden's index). The rate of histologic response in those who achieved less than 30% decline in MRI-PDFF versus those who achieved a 30% or greater decline in MRI-PDFF (MRI-PDFF responders) relative to baseline was 19% versus 50%, respectively. Compared with MRI-PDFF nonresponders, MRI-PDFF responders demonstrated both a statistically and clinically significant higher odds 4.86 (95% CI, 1.4-12.8, P value < 0.009) of histologic response, including significant improvements in both steatosis and ballooning.\nCONCLUSION\nOCA was better than placebo in reducing liver fat.

This study sought associations between observed improvements in fibrosis with improvement in specific histologic features, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) ≥2, diagnostic category, and primary histologically based outcomes of two adult NASH treatment trials. The primary outcome for the study was fibrosis improvement from baseline to end of treatment, defined as a 1-point or more improvement in fibrosis stage. This is a retrospective analysis of biopsy data collected from the NASH Clinical Research Network Pathology Committee of Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with NASH Trial (PIVENS) and Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment Trial (FLINT) baseline and final biopsies. Treatment group-adjusted univariable and multivariable logistic regression models related improvement in fibrosis to improvements in other histologic variables, resolution of steatohepatitis, and improvement in the NAS ≥2. In PIVENS 221 subjects had baseline and 96-week biopsies, and in FLINT 200 subjects had baseline and 72-week biopsies. Improvement in fibrosis was found in 38% of PIVENS and 29% of FLINT biopsies; fibrosis improvement was more likely in treated than placebo subjects in both studies.

However, within some specialties, including renal medicine, qualitative approaches remain under-represented in the high-impact factor journals. Qualitative research can be undertaken: (i) as a stand-alone research method, addressing specific research questions; (ii) as part of a mixed methods approach alongside quantitative approaches or (iii) embedded in clinical trials, or during the development of complex interventions. The aim of this paper is to introduce qualitative research, including the rationale for choosing qualitative approaches, and guidance for ensuring quality when undertaking and reporting qualitative research. In addition, we introduce types of qualitative data (observation, interviews and focus groups) as well as some of the most commonly encountered methodological approaches (case studies, ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, thematic analysis, framework analysis and content analysis). \n**Keywords:** focus groups; interviews; methodology; observation; qualitative. \n© The Author 2015.

We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nMETHODS\nWe did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the USA in patients with non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to assess treatment with obeticholic acid given orally (25 mg daily) or placebo for 72 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01265498.\nFINDINGS\nBetween March 16, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 141 patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic acid and 142 to placebo. 50 (45%) of 110 patients in the obeticholic acid group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and 72 weeks had improved liver histology compared with 23 (21%) of 109 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 2·8; p=0·0002). 33 (23%) of 141 patients in the obeticholic acid developed pruritus compared with nine (6%) of 142 in the placebo group.\nINTERPRETATION\nObeticholic acid improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification.\nFUNDING\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Intercept Pharmaceuticals.", "year": "2015", "venue": "Lancet (London, England)"}, {"paperId": "25926979", "title": "Recent advances in understanding/management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.", "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to advanced fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.

There are limited multicenter data comparing an active drug versus placebo on the association between the quantity of liver fat reduction assessed by MRI-PDFF and histologic response in NASH. This study aims to examine the association between 30% relative reduction in MRI-PDFF and histologic response in obeticholic acid (OCA) versus placebo-treated patients in the FLINT (farnesoid X receptor ligand obeticholic acid in NASH trial).\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS\nThis is a secondary analysis of the FLINT trial including 78 patients with MRI-PDFF measured before and after treatment along with paired liver histology assessment. Histologic response was defined as a 2-point improvement in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score without worsening of fibrosis. OCA (25 mg orally once daily) was better than placebo in improving MRI-PDFF by an absolute difference of -3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -6.5 to -0.2%, P value = 0.04) and relative difference of -17% (95% CI, -34 to 0%, P value = 0.05). The optimal cutoff point for relative decline in MRI-PDFF for histologic response was 30% (using Youden's index). The rate of histologic response in those who achieved less than 30% decline in MRI-PDFF versus those who achieved a 30% or greater decline in MRI-PDFF (MRI-PDFF responders) relative to baseline was 19% versus 50%, respectively. Compared with MRI-PDFF nonresponders, MRI-PDFF responders demonstrated both a statistically and clinically significant higher odds 4.86 (95% CI, 1.4-12.8, P value < 0.009) of histologic response, including significant improvements in both steatosis and ballooning.\nCONCLUSION\nOCA was better than placebo in reducing liver fat.

Yet, the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis has remained unproved.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of canakinumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, involving 10,061 patients with previous myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per liter. The trial compared three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg, administered subcutaneously every 3 months) with placebo. The primary efficacy end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS\nAt 48 months, the median reduction from baseline in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 26 percentage points greater in the group that received the 50-mg dose of canakinumab, 37 percentage points greater in the 150-mg group, and 41 percentage points greater in the 300-mg group than in the placebo group. Canakinumab did not reduce lipid levels from baseline. At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the incidence rate for the primary end point was 4.50 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group, 4.11 events per 100 person-years in the 50-mg group, 3.86 events per 100 person-years in the 150-mg group, and 3.90 events per 100 person-years in the 300-mg group. The hazard ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the 50-mg group, 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.07; P=0.30); in the 150-mg group, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.021); and in the 300-mg group, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P=0.031). The 150-mg dose, but not the other doses, met the prespecified multiplicity-adjusted threshold for statistical significance for the primary end point and the secondary end point that additionally included hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascularization (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005). Canakinumab was associated with a higher incidence of fatal infection than was placebo. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio for all canakinumab doses vs. placebo, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.06; P=0.31).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAntiinflammatory therapy targeting the interleukin-1β innate immunity pathway with canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo, independent of lipid-level lowering.

Moreover, studies in mouse models indicate a causal role of inflammasomes and IL-1β in atherosclerosis. However, recent studies have led to a more granular view of the role of inflammasomes in atherosclerosis. Studies in hyperlipidemic mouse models suggest that prominent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a second hit such as defective cholesterol efflux, defective DNA repair, clonal hematopoiesis or diabetes. Similarly in humans some mutations promoting clonal hematopoiesis increase coronary artery disease risk in part by promoting inflammasome activation. Recent studies in mice and humans point to a wider role of the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome in promoting cardiovascular disease including in some forms of clonal hematopoiesis and diabetes. These developments suggest a precision medicine approach in which treatments targeting inflammasomes or IL-1β might be best employed in clinical settings involving increased inflammasome activation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29146124\">Title: Relationship of C-reactive protein reduction to cardiovascular event reduction following treatment with canakinumab: a secondary analysis from the CANTOS randomised controlled trial.\nAuthors: Ridker, Paul M, MacFadyen, Jean G, Everett, Brendan M et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Lancet (London, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCanakinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, reduces inflammation and cardiovascular event rates with no effect on lipid concentrations. However, it is uncertain which patient groups benefit the most from treatment and whether reductions in the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) correlate with clinical benefits for individual patients.\nMETHODS\nThe Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) used computer-generated codes to randomly allocate 10 061 men and women with a history of myocardial infarction to placebo or one of three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) given subcutaneously once every 3 months. In a prespecified secondary analysis designed to address the relationship of hsCRP reduction to event reduction in CANTOS, we evaluated the effects of canakinumab on rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality according to on-treatment concentrations of hsCRP. We used multivariable modelling to adjust for baseline factors associated with achieved hsCRP and multiple sensitivity analyses to address the magnitude of residual confounding. The median follow-up was 3·7 years. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01327846.\nFINDINGS\nBaseline clinical characteristics did not define patient groups with greater or lesser cardiovascular benefits when treated with canakinumab. However, trial participants allocated to canakinumab who achieved hsCRP concentrations less than 2 mg/L had a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio [HR adj ]=0·75, 95% CI 0·66-0·85, p<0·0001), whereas no significant benefit was observed among those with on-treatment hsCRP concentrations of 2 mg/L or above (HR adj =0·90, 0·79-1·02, p=0·11). For those treated with canakinumab who achieved on-treatment hsCRP concentrations less than 2 mg/L, cardiovascular mortality (HR adj =0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·85, p=0·0004) and all-cause mortality (HR adj =0·69, 0·58-0·81, p<0·0001) were both reduced by 31%, whereas no significant reduction in these endpoints was observed among those treated with canakinumab who achieved hsCRP concentrations of 2 mg/L or above. Similar differential effects were found in analyses of the trial prespecified secondary cardiovascular endpoint (which additionally included hospitalisation for unstable angina requiring unplanned revascularisation) and in sensitivity analyses alternatively based on median reductions in hsCRP, on 50% or greater reductions in hsCRP, on the median percent reduction in hsCRP, in dose-specific analyses, and in analyses using a causal inference approach to estimate the effect of treatment among individuals who would achieve a targeted hsCRP concentration.\nINTERPRETATION\nThe magnitude of hsCRP reduction following a single dose of canakinumab might provide a simple clinical method to identify individuals most likely to accrue the largest benefit from continued treatment. These data further suggest that lower is better for inflammation reduction with canakinumab.\nFUNDING\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29880500\">Title: NLRP3 Inflammasome and the IL-1 Pathway in Atherosclerosis.\nAuthors: Grebe, Alena, Hoss, Florian, Latz, Eicke | Year: 2018 | Journal: Circulation research\nAbstract: Inflammation is an important driver of atherosclerosis, the underlying pathology of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of inflammatory pathways is suggested to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases. This concept was recently proven by CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study), which demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the monoclonal IL (interleukin)-1β-neutralizing antibody canakinumab. IL-1β and other IL-1 family cytokines are important vascular and systemic inflammatory mediators, which contribute to atherogenesis. The NLRP3 (NOD [nucleotide oligomerization domain]-, LRR [leucine-rich repeat]-, and PYD [pyrin domain]-containing protein 3) inflammasome, an innate immune signaling complex, is the key mediator of IL-1 family cytokine production in atherosclerosis. NLRP3 is activated by various endogenous danger signals abundantly present in atherosclerotic lesions, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol crystals. Consequently, NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the vascular inflammatory response driving atherosclerosis development and progression. Here, we review the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and proinflammatory IL-1 family cytokine production in the context of atherosclerosis and discuss treatment possibilities in light of the positive outcomes of the CANTOS trial.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29607136\">Title: Anti-inflammatory therapy with canakinumab for atherosclerotic disease: lessons from the CANTOS trial.\nAuthors: Thompson, Peter L, Nidorf, S Mark | Year: 2018 | Journal: Journal of thoracic disease\nAbstract: </snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">COLCOT colchicine 31733140</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 48 results.

Colchicine is an orally administered, potent antiinflammatory medication that is indicated for the treatment of gout and pericarditis.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a randomized, double-blind trial involving patients recruited within 30 days after a myocardial infarction. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization. The components of the primary end point and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS\nA total of 4745 patients were enrolled; 2366 patients were assigned to the colchicine group, and 2379 to the placebo group. Patients were followed for a median of 22.6 months. The primary end point occurred in 5.5% of the patients in the colchicine group, as compared with 7.1% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.96; P = 0.02). The hazard ratios were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.46 to 1.52) for death from cardiovascular causes, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.25 to 2.73) for resuscitated cardiac arrest, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.21) for myocardial infarction, 0.26 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.70) for stroke, and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.81) for urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization. Diarrhea was reported in 9.7% of the patients in the colchicine group and in 8.9% of those in the placebo group (P = 0.35). Pneumonia was reported as a serious adverse event in 0.9% of the patients in the colchicine group and in 0.4% of those in the placebo group (P = 0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with a recent myocardial infarction, colchicine at a dose of 0.5 mg daily led to a significantly lower risk of ischemic cardiovascular events than placebo.

Its effects were evaluated in this prespecified analysis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nCOLCOT was a randomized, double-blinded trial of colchicine, 0.5 mg daily, versus placebo initiated within 30 days after a myocardial infarction.\nRESULTS\nThere were 959 patients with T2D enrolled and monitored for a median of 22.6 months. A primary end point event occurred in 8.7% of patients in the colchicine group and in 13.1% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.44-0.96; P = 0.03). Nausea was reported in 2.7% and 0.8% in the study groups (P = 0.03), and pneumonia occurred in 2.4% and 0.4% (P = 0.008).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with T2D and a recent myocardial infarction, colchicine, 0.5 mg daily, leads to a large reduction of cardiovascular events. These results support the conduct of the COLCOT-T2D trial in primary prevention.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39166327\">Title: Effect of Colchicine on Coronary Plaque Stability in Acute Coronary Syndrome as Assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography: The COLOCT Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Yu, Miao, Yang, Yong, Dong, Si-Lai et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Circulation\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nColchicine has been approved to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary heart disease on the basis of its potential benefits demonstrated in the COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) and LoDoCo2 (Low-Dose Colchicine 2) studies. Nevertheless, there are limited data available about the specific impact of colchicine on coronary plaques.\nMETHODS\nThis was a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. From May 3, 2021, until August 31, 2022, a total of 128 patients with acute coronary syndrome aged 18 to 80 years with lipid-rich plaque (lipid pool arc >90°) detected by optical coherence tomography were included. The subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) or placebo for 12 months. The primary end point was the change in the minimal fibrous cap thickness from baseline to the 12-month follow-up.\nRESULTS\nAmong 128 patients, 52 in the colchicine group and 52 in the placebo group completed the study. The mean age of the 128 patients was 58.0±9.8 years, and 25.0% were female. Compared with placebo, colchicine therapy significantly increased the minimal fibrous cap thickness (51.9 [95% CI, 32.8 to 71.0] μm versus 87.2 [95% CI, 69.9 to 104.5] μm; difference, 34.2 [95% CI, 9.7 to 58.6] μm; P =0.006), and reduced average lipid arc (-25.2° [95% CI, -30.6° to -19.9°] versus -35.7° [95% CI, -40.5° to -30.8°]; difference, -10.5° [95% CI, -17.7° to -3.4°]; P =0.004), mean angular extension of macrophages (-8.9° [95% CI, -13.3° to -4.6°] versus -14.0° [95% CI, -18.0° to -10.0°]; difference, -6.0° [95% CI, -11.8° to -0.2°]; P =0.044), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level (geometric mean ratio, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.0] versus 0.3 [95% CI, 0.2 to 0.5]; difference, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.0]; P =0.046), interleukin-6 level (geometric mean ratio, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.1] versus 0.5 [95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7]; difference, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4 to 0.9]; P =0.025), and myeloperoxidase level (geometric mean ratio, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.8 to 1.2] versus 0.8 [95% CI, 0.7 to 0.9]; difference, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.0]; P =0.047).\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggested that colchicine resulted in favorable effects on coronary plaque stabilization at optical coherence tomography in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\nREGISTRATION\nURL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04848857.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35716932\">Title: Low-dose colchicine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein after myocardial infarction: A combined analysis using individual patient data from the COLCOT and LoDoCo-MI studies.\nAuthors: Sun, Maxine, Dubé, Marie-Pierre, Hennessy, Thomas et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: International journal of cardiology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nLow-dose colchicine is effective in reducing the risks of recurrent cardiovascular events following an acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, the influence of colchicine on inflammation remains inconclusive. In the current study, we conducted a combined analysis using individual patient data from the COLCOT and LoDoCo-MI trials to assess the effect of low-dose colchicine on high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with acute MI.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a combined analysis of individual patient data from two clinical trials (COLCOT, LoDoCo-MI). Paired pre-treatment and post-treatment hs-CRP (mg/L) were available in 222 patients for LoDoCo-MI and 207 patients for COLCOT (n pooled = 429). We evaluated the effect of colchicine vs. placebo on post-treatment hs-CRP coded continuously and ≤ 1.0 mg/L in adjusted mixed-model multi-level regression analyses.\nRESULTS\nColchicine was not significantly associated with post-treatment hs-CRP when it was considered as a continuous variable (beta: -0.41, P = 0.429). However, the intervention was significantly associated with increased odds of achieving post-treatment hs-CRP values ≤1.0 mg/L compared to placebo (odds ratio: 1.64, 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 2.51, P = 0.024).\nCONCLUSIONS\nReduction of inflammation may be a key component in the clinical efficacy of low-dose colchicine with respect to decreased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events following MI. Systematic sampling of hs-CRP before and after treatment with colchicine may be relevant.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33560138\">Title: Pharmacogenomics of the Efficacy and Safety of Colchicine in COLCOT.\nAuthors: Dubé, Marie-Pierre, Legault, Marc-André, Lemaçon, Audrey et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Circulation. Genomic and precision medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) has shown the benefits of colchicine 0.5 mg daily to lower the rate of ischemic cardiovascular events in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. Here, we conducted a post hoc pharmacogenomic study of COLCOT with the aim to identify genetic predictors of the efficacy and safety of treatment with colchicine.\nMETHODS\nThere were 1522 participants of European ancestry from the COLCOT trial available for the pharmacogenomic study of COLCOT trial. The pharmacogenomic study's primary cardiovascular end point was defined as for the main trial, as time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent hospitalization for angina requiring coronary revascularization. The safety end point was time to the first report of gastrointestinal events. Patients' DNA was genotyped using the Illumina Global Screening array followed by imputation. We performed a genome-wide association study in colchicine-treated patients.\nRESULTS\nNone of the genetic variants passed the genome-wide association study significance threshold for the primary cardiovascular end point conducted in 702 patients in the colchicine arm who were compliant to medication. The genome-wide association study for gastrointestinal events was conducted in all 767 patients in the colchicine arm and found 2 significant association signals, one with lead variant rs6916345 (hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.52-2.35], P =7.41×10 -9 ) in a locus which colocalizes with Crohn disease, and one with lead variant rs74795203 (hazard ratio, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.82-3.47]; P =2.70×10 -8 ), an intronic variant in gene SEPHS1 . The interaction terms between the genetic variants and treatment with colchicine versus placebo were significant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found 2 genomic regions associated with gastrointestinal events in patients treated with colchicine. Those findings will benefit from replication to confirm that some patients may have genetic predispositions to lower tolerability of treatment with colchicine.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">LoDoCo2 colchicine 31904751</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 46 results.

The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous (nonprocedural) myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke.\nRESULTS\nA total of 5522 patients underwent randomization; 2762 were assigned to the colchicine group and 2760 to the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up was 28.6 months. A primary end-point event occurred in 187 patients (6.8%) in the colchicine group and in 264 patients (9.6%) in the placebo group (incidence, 2.5 vs. 3.6 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.83; P<0.001).

Advances\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn the COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) and LoDoCo2 (Low-Dose Colchicine 2) coronary artery disease trials, low-dose colchicine decreased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) by 23% to 31% beyond statin therapy with a strong safety profile. The number of MACE potentially preventable by widespread colchicine use in the United States remains uncertain.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the current and potential impact of colchicine on cardiovascular outcomes.\nMETHODS\nWe first calculated the number of new colchicine users with coronary artery disease before and after COLCOT and LoDoCo2 publication at an integrated health care system in southeastern New England from 2018 to 2023. Second, we estimated the number of potentially avoidable MACEs with widespread colchicine use using incidence rates and the relative risk reduction from the LoDoCo2 trial and the nationally representative National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey study.\nRESULTS\nFrom January 2018 to December 2019 (before COLCOT and LoDoCo2 publication), the number of new colchicine users varied between 126 and 151 every 6 months. From January 2020 to June 2023, the number of new colchicine users increased from 141 to 181 every 6 months (<1% of adults with coronary artery disease at Mass General Brigham). Among the estimated 9.2 million adults with stable coronary artery disease on a statin in the United States, adding colchicine to standard medical management is estimated to prevent 226,000 MACE over a 3-year period.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdding colchicine to standard cardiovascular management may prevent 226,000 MACE in the United States over a 3-year period.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37247416\">Title: Association of Low-Dose Colchicine With Incidence of Knee and Hip Replacements : Exploratory Analyses From a Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Trial.\nAuthors: Heijman, Michelle W J, Fiolet, Aernoud T L, Mosterd, Arend et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Annals of internal medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nOsteoarthritis is a major contributor to pain and disability worldwide.

Yet, the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis has remained unproved.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of canakinumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, involving 10,061 patients with previous myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per liter. The trial compared three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg, administered subcutaneously every 3 months) with placebo. The primary efficacy end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS\nAt 48 months, the median reduction from baseline in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 26 percentage points greater in the group that received the 50-mg dose of canakinumab, 37 percentage points greater in the 150-mg group, and 41 percentage points greater in the 300-mg group than in the placebo group. Canakinumab did not reduce lipid levels from baseline. At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the incidence rate for the primary end point was 4.50 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group, 4.11 events per 100 person-years in the 50-mg group, 3.86 events per 100 person-years in the 150-mg group, and 3.90 events per 100 person-years in the 300-mg group. The hazard ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the 50-mg group, 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.07; P=0.30); in the 150-mg group, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.021); and in the 300-mg group, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P=0.031). The 150-mg dose, but not the other doses, met the prespecified multiplicity-adjusted threshold for statistical significance for the primary end point and the secondary end point that additionally included hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascularization (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005).

Moreover, studies in mouse models indicate a causal role of inflammasomes and IL-1β in atherosclerosis. However, recent studies have led to a more granular view of the role of inflammasomes in atherosclerosis. Studies in hyperlipidemic mouse models suggest that prominent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a second hit such as defective cholesterol efflux, defective DNA repair, clonal hematopoiesis or diabetes. Similarly in humans some mutations promoting clonal hematopoiesis increase coronary artery disease risk in part by promoting inflammasome activation. Recent studies in mice and humans point to a wider role of the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome in promoting cardiovascular disease including in some forms of clonal hematopoiesis and diabetes.

However, it is uncertain which patient groups benefit the most from treatment and whether reductions in the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) correlate with clinical benefits for individual patients.\nMETHODS\nThe Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) used computer-generated codes to randomly allocate 10 061 men and women with a history of myocardial infarction to placebo or one of three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg) given subcutaneously once every 3 months. In a prespecified secondary analysis designed to address the relationship of hsCRP reduction to event reduction in CANTOS, we evaluated the effects of canakinumab on rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality according to on-treatment concentrations of hsCRP. We used multivariable modelling to adjust for baseline factors associated with achieved hsCRP and multiple sensitivity analyses to address the magnitude of residual confounding. The median follow-up was 3·7 years. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01327846.\nFINDINGS\nBaseline clinical characteristics did not define patient groups with greater or lesser cardiovascular benefits when treated with canakinumab. However, trial participants allocated to canakinumab who achieved hsCRP concentrations less than 2 mg/L had a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio [HR adj ]=0·75, 95% CI 0·66-0·85, p<0·0001), whereas no significant benefit was observed among those with on-treatment hsCRP concentrations of 2 mg/L or above (HR adj =0·90, 0·79-1·02, p=0·11). For those treated with canakinumab who achieved on-treatment hsCRP concentrations less than 2 mg/L, cardiovascular mortality (HR adj =0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·85, p=0·0004) and all-cause mortality (HR adj =0·69, 0·58-0·81, p<0·0001) were both reduced by 31%, whereas no significant reduction in these endpoints was observed among those treated with canakinumab who achieved hsCRP concentrations of 2 mg/L or above. Similar differential effects were found in analyses of the trial prespecified secondary cardiovascular endpoint (which additionally included hospitalisation for unstable angina requiring unplanned revascularisation) and in sensitivity analyses alternatively based on median reductions in hsCRP, on 50% or greater reductions in hsCRP, on the median percent reduction in hsCRP, in dose-specific analyses, and in analyses using a causal inference approach to estimate the effect of treatment among individuals who would achieve a targeted hsCRP concentration.\nINTERPRETATION\nThe magnitude of hsCRP reduction following a single dose of canakinumab might provide a simple clinical method to identify individuals most likely to accrue the largest benefit from continued treatment.

The incidence rates of spontaneous myocardial infarction or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization (composite end point), cardiovascular death or spontaneous myocardial infarction (composite end point), ischemia-driven coronary revascularization, and spontaneous myocardial infarction were also significantly lower with colchicine than with placebo. The incidence of death from noncardiovascular causes was higher in the colchicine group than in the placebo group (incidence, 0.7 vs. 0.5 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.31).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a randomized trial involving patients with chronic coronary disease, the risk of cardiovascular events was significantly lower among those who received 0.5 mg of colchicine once daily than among those who received placebo.

ALS/Riluzole Study Group.\nAuthors: Bensimon, G, Lacomblez, L, Meininger, V | Year: 1994 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive motor neuron disease for which there is no adequate treatment. Some research suggests that the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate may be involved in the pathogenesis.\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of the antiglutamate agent riluzole, we conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 155 outpatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The dose of riluzole was 100 mg per day. Randomization was stratified according to the site of disease onset (the bulbar region or the limbs). The primary end points were survival and rates of change in functional status. The main secondary end point was change in muscle strength. Analyses were undertaken after 12 months of treatment and at the end of the placebo-controlled period (median follow-up, 573 days).\nRESULTS\nAfter 12 months, 45 of 78 patients (58 percent) in the placebo group were still alive, as compared with 57 of 77 patients (74 percent) in the riluzole group (P = 0.014). For patients with bulbar-onset disease, one-year survival rates were 35 percent (6 of 17) with placebo and 73 percent (11 of 15) with riluzole (P = 0.014), whereas for those with limb-onset disease one-year survival was 64 percent and 74 percent, respectively (P = 0.17). The survival advantage with riluzole was smaller (37 percent [29 of 78] with placebo vs. 49 percent [38 of 77] with riluzole) at the end of the placebo-controlled period, but it remained significant in the overall population (P = 0.046) as well as in the patients with bulbar-onset disease (18 percent [3 of 17] vs. 53 percent [8 of 15], P = 0.013). The deterioration of muscle strength was significantly slower in the riluzole group than in the placebo group (P = 0.028). Adverse reactions to riluzole included asthenia, spasticity, and mild elevations in aminotransferase levels. Twenty-seven patients in the riluzole group withdrew from the study, as compared with 17 in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe antiglutamate agent riluzole appears to slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and it may improve survival in patients with disease of bulbar onset.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34120226\">Title: A systematic review of non-motor symptom evaluation in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nAuthors: Beswick, Emily, Forbes, Deborah, Hassan, Zack et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Journal of neurology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a multi-system disorder, presenting with common and impactful non-motor symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric symtpoms, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue and problematic saliva.\nAIM/HYPOTHESIS\nWe aimed to systematically review 25 years of ALS clinical trials data to identify if non-motor features were evaluated, in addition to the traditional measures of motor functioning and survival, and where evaluated to describe the instruments used to assess. We hypothesised that assessment of non-motor symptoms has been largely neglected in trial design and not evaluated with ALS-suitable instruments.\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed clinical trials of investigative medicinal products in ALS, since the licensing of riluzole in 1994. Trial registry databases including WHO International Trials Registry, European Clinical Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed were systematically searched for Phase II, III or IV trials registered, completed or published between 01/01/1994 and 16/09/2020. No language restrictions were applied.\nRESULTS\n237 clinical trials, including over 29,222 participants, were investigated for their use of non-motor outcome measures. These trials evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms (75, 32%), cognitive impairment (16, 6.8%), behavioural change (34, 14%), pain (55, 23%), sleep disturbances (12, 5%) and fatigue (18, 8%). Problematic saliva was assessed as part of composite ALS-FRS(R) scores in 184 trials (78%) but with no focus on this as an isolated symptom. 31 (13%) trials including 3585 participants did not include any assessment of non-motor symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS\nNon-motor symptoms such as neuropsychiatric, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue, and problematic saliva have not been consistently evaluated in trials for people with ALS. Where evaluated, non-symptoms were primarily assessed using instruments and impairment thresholds that are not adapted for people with ALS. Future trials should include non-motor symptom assessments to evaluate the additional potential therapeutic benefit of candidate drugs.\nPROPSERO REGISTRATION\nCRD42020223648.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37748881\">Title: Epidemiologic Trends of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Ireland, 1996-2021.\nAuthors: McFarlane, Robert, Peelo, Colm, Galvin, Miriam et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Neurology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this study was to examine changes to the incidence, prevalence, age at onset, and survival of patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Republic of Ireland over 25 years.\nMETHODS\nIncident and prevalent cases of ALS were estimated using the Irish population-based ALS Register, which has been in continuous operation since 1994. Incident cases were age standardized using the direct method and applied to 3 standard populations (Irish, European, and American). Survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. Non-normally distributed groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with a Bonferroni correction.\nRESULTS\nA total of 2,771 patients with ALS were identified in the Republic of Ireland over 25 years. Incidence per 100,000 was determined for the population older than 15 years. Crude incidence increased from 2.64 to 5.46 per 100,000. Standardized incidence increased from 2.64 to 3.1 per 100,000. Prevalence increased from 5.83 to 8.10 per 100,000. The median age at onset increased from 64 to 67 years. The peak age of incidence increased from those between 70 and 74 years to those between 75 and 79 years. Overall, women had a consistently later median age at onset of 67 years compared with men at 65 years ( p < 0.001). No significant difference in survival was noted between those captured across 3 different epochs (1996-2003, 2004-2012, 2013-2021). Older age at onset (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, CI 1.02-1.04, p < 0.001) was a negative predictive factor of survival in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Riluzole use (HR 0.67, CI 0.50-0.90, p = 0.033) and diagnostic delay (HR 0.98, CI 0.98-0.99, p < 0.001) were positive predictive factors.\nDISCUSSION\nWithin the Republic of Ireland, the age-standardized overall incidence, peak incidence, prevalence, and age at onset of ALS have all increased over 25 years. Despite the widespread use of noninvasive ventilation, aggressive secretion management, and changes in ALS care, the mean survival within the Irish population has not changed.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29525492\">Title: Stage at which riluzole treatment prolongs survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a retrospective analysis of data from a dose-ranging study.\nAuthors: Fang, Ton, Al Khleifat, Ahmad, Meurgey, Jacques-Henri et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: The Lancet. Neurology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nRiluzole is the only drug to prolong survival for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and, at a dose of 100 mg, was associated with a 35% reduction in mortality in a clinical trial. A key question is whether the survival benefit occurs at an early stage of disease, late stage, or is spread throughout the course of the disease. To address this question, we used the King's clinical staging system to do a retrospective analysis of data from the original dose-ranging clinical trial of riluzole.\nMETHODS\nIn the original dose-ranging trial, patients were enrolled between December, 1992, and November, 1993, in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, the USA, and the UK if they had probable or definite ALS as defined by the El Escorial criteria. The censor date for the riluzole survival data was set as the original study end date of Dec 31, 1994. For this analysis, King's clinical ALS stage was estimated from the electronic case record data of the modified Norris scale, UK Medical Research Council score for muscle strength, El Escorial category, vital capacity, and gastrostomy insertion data. The lowest allocated stage was 2 because the original trial only included patients with probable or definite ALS. We used a χ 2 test to assess the independence of stage at trial enrolment and treatment group, Kaplan-Meier product limit distribution to test the transition from each stage to subsequent stages, and Cox regression to confirm an effect of treatment group on time in stage, controlling for covariates. We did sensitivity analyses by combining treatment groups, using alternative strategies to stage, stratifying by stage at trial enrolment, and using multistate outcome analysis of treatments (MOAT).\nFINDINGS\nWe analysed the case records of all 959 participants from the original dose-ranging trial, 237 assigned to 50 mg/day riluzole, 236 to 100 mg/day, 244 to 200 mg/day, and 242 to daily placebo. Clinical stage at enrolment did not significantly differ between treatment groups (p=0·22). Time in stage 4 was longer for patients receiving 100 mg/day riluzole than for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·55, 95% CI 0·36-0·83; log-rank p=0·037). Combining treatment groups and stratifying by stage at enrolment showed a similar result (HR 0·638, 95% CI 0·464-0·878; p=0·006), as did analysis with MOAT where the mean number of days spent in stage 4 was numerically higher for patients given riluzole at higher doses compared with patients receiving placebo. Time from stages 2 or 3 to subsequent stages or death did not differ between riluzole treatment groups and placebo (p=0·83 for stage 2 and 0·88 for stage 3).\nINTERPRETATION\nWe showed that riluzole prolongs survival in the last clinical stage of ALS; this finding needs to be confirmed in a prospective study, and treatment effects at stage 1 still need to be analysed. The ALS stage at which benefit occurs is important for counselling of patients before starting treatment. Staging should be used in future ALS clinical trials to assess the stage at which survival benefit occurs, and a similar approach could be used for other neurodegenerative diseases.\nFUNDING\nNIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, The European Union Joint Programme on Neurodegeneration, and the King's Summer Undergraduate Studentship.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"11676998\">Title: The cost utility analysis of riluzole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the UK.\nAuthors: Tavakoli, M, Malek, M | Year: 2001 | Journal: Journal of the neurological sciences\nAbstract: This study reports the results of a long-term economic evaluation of riluzole in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus best supportive care in the United Kingdom. The aim was to assess the cost implications of the life extension offered by riluzole through cost utility analysis based on patient assessed utilities of different health states.A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of Rilutek with best supportive care. Transition possibilities and the distribution of patients by health states were taken from a cohort of 954 patients drawn from a large randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial between 1992 and 1994 in the first 18 months and used to extrapolate the model to assess the long-term prolongation of life. Four distinct health states were used corresponding to mild, moderate, severe and terminal states. Costs associated with Rilutek included the acquisition cost and bi-monthly monitoring for raised ALT levels. Patient assessed utilities were collected by use of the standard gamble technique. 77 patients were entered into the study from two centres (King's, London and Preston) in the UK. Mean utilities for each of the health states was generated and, given that the data were skewed, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken with the median utility values. The implications of life extension offered by riluzole versus best supportive care were assessed both in terms of life extension projected and quality adjusted survival using patient based utilities. Using the Markov model and the transitional probabilities the base case cost per life year gained was estimated at pound sterlings 14,370 and applying Standard Gamble utility scores, the base case cost per QALY was assessed as pound sterlings 20,904. The effect of discounting costs and benefits altered the cost effectiveness analysis to pound sterlings 17,760 per life year gained while a sensitivity analysis around median or mean scores for the utility weight resulted in a range of pound sterlings 19,020 to pound sterlings 25,794 per QALY gained.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">8043057 riluzole amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1056 results.

No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P < 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49% in the placebo and 58% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.31).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nRiluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30101496\">Title: Riluzole and edaravone: A tale of two amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drugs.\nAuthors: Jaiswal, Manoj Kumar | Year: 2019 | Journal: Medicinal research reviews\nAbstract: Over the past decades, a multitude of experimental drugs have been shown to delay disease progression in preclinical animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but failed to show efficacy in human clinical trials or are still waiting for approval under Phase I-III trials.

Riluzole is a benzothiazole derivative that blocks glutamatergic neurotransmission in the CNS, which is thought to exert neuroprotective effects. Riluzole was approved by the US FDA in 1995 as the first drug to treat ALS. Although riluzole is generally safe and well tolerated in clinical practice, its efficacy in ALS is modest, prolonging tracheostomy-free survival by only 2-3 months. In this article, we will first provide an overview of the ALS field, followed by a discussion of riluzole regarding its physical properties; pharmacology; clinical efficacy in ALS; safety and tolerability; and recommended administration.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"8302340\">Title: A controlled trial of riluzole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ALS/Riluzole Study Group.\nAuthors: Bensimon, G, Lacomblez, L, Meininger, V | Year: 1994 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive motor neuron disease for which there is no adequate treatment. Some research suggests that the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate may be involved in the pathogenesis.\nMETHODS\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of the antiglutamate agent riluzole, we conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 155 outpatients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The dose of riluzole was 100 mg per day. Randomization was stratified according to the site of disease onset (the bulbar region or the limbs). The primary end points were survival and rates of change in functional status. The main secondary end point was change in muscle strength. Analyses were undertaken after 12 months of treatment and at the end of the placebo-controlled period (median follow-up, 573 days).\nRESULTS\nAfter 12 months, 45 of 78 patients (58 percent) in the placebo group were still alive, as compared with 57 of 77 patients (74 percent) in the riluzole group (P = 0.014). For patients with bulbar-onset disease, one-year survival rates were 35 percent (6 of 17) with placebo and 73 percent (11 of 15) with riluzole (P = 0.014), whereas for those with limb-onset disease one-year survival was 64 percent and 74 percent, respectively (P = 0.17). The survival advantage with riluzole was smaller (37 percent [29 of 78] with placebo vs. 49 percent [38 of 77] with riluzole) at the end of the placebo-controlled period, but it remained significant in the overall population (P = 0.046) as well as in the patients with bulbar-onset disease (18 percent [3 of 17] vs. 53 percent [8 of 15], P = 0.013). The deterioration of muscle strength was significantly slower in the riluzole group than in the placebo group (P = 0.028). Adverse reactions to riluzole included asthenia, spasticity, and mild elevations in aminotransferase levels. Twenty-seven patients in the riluzole group withdrew from the study, as compared with 17 in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe antiglutamate agent riluzole appears to slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and it may improve survival in patients with disease of bulbar onset.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35269543\">Title: Comprehensive Research on Past and Future Therapeutic Strategies Devoted to Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\nAuthors: Sever, Belgin, Ciftci, Halilibrahim, DeMirci, Hasan et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: International journal of molecular sciences\nAbstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly debilitating fatal neurodegenerative disorder, causing muscle atrophy and weakness, which leads to paralysis and eventual death. ALS has a multifaceted nature affected by many pathological mechanisms, including oxidative stress (also via protein aggregation), mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, skeletal muscle deterioration and viruses. This complexity is a major obstacle in defeating ALS. At present, riluzole and edaravone are the only drugs that have passed clinical trials for the treatment of ALS, notwithstanding that they showed modest benefits in a limited population of ALS. A dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate combination was also approved to treat pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in the course of ALS. Globally, there is a struggle to prevent or alleviate the symptoms of this neurodegenerative disease, including implementation of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), CRISPR-9/Cas technique, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) or ALS-on-a-chip technology. Additionally, researchers have synthesized and screened new compounds to be effective in ALS beyond the drug repurposing strategy. Despite all these efforts, ALS treatment is largely limited to palliative care, and there is a strong need for new therapeutics to be developed. This review focuses on and discusses which therapeutic strategies have been followed so far and what can be done in the future for the treatment of ALS.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">8043057 riluzole ALS</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 839 results.

As the exact underlying causative pathological pathway is unclear and potentially diverse, finding a suitable therapy to slow down or possibly stop disease progression remains challenging. Varying by country Riluzole, Edaravone, and Sodium phenylbutyrate/Taurursodiol are the only drugs currently approved in ALS treatment for their moderate effect on disease progression. Even though curative treatment options, able to prevent or stop disease progression, are still unknown, recent breakthroughs, especially in the field of targeting genetic disease forms, raise hope for improved care and therapy for ALS patients. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of ALS therapy, including medication as well as supportive therapy, and discuss the ongoing developments and prospects in the field. Furthermore, we highlight the rationale behind the intense research on biomarkers and genetic testing as a feasible way to improve the classification of ALS patients towards personalized medicine.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"8302340\">Title: A controlled trial of riluzole in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

We hypothesised that assessment of non-motor symptoms has been largely neglected in trial design and not evaluated with ALS-suitable instruments.\nMETHODS\nWe reviewed clinical trials of investigative medicinal products in ALS, since the licensing of riluzole in 1994.

Incident cases were age standardized using the direct method and applied to 3 standard populations (Irish, European, and American). Survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. Non-normally distributed groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with a Bonferroni correction.\nRESULTS\nA total of 2,771 patients with ALS were identified in the Republic of Ireland over 25 years. Incidence per 100,000 was determined for the population older than 15 years. Crude incidence increased from 2.64 to 5.46 per 100,000. Standardized incidence increased from 2.64 to 3.1 per 100,000.

Overall, women had a consistently later median age at onset of 67 years compared with men at 65 years ( p < 0.001). No significant difference in survival was noted between those captured across 3 different epochs (1996-2003, 2004-2012, 2013-2021).

A key question is whether the survival benefit occurs at an early stage of disease, late stage, or is spread throughout the course of the disease. To address this question, we used the King's clinical staging system to do a retrospective analysis of data from the original dose-ranging clinical trial of riluzole.\nMETHODS\nIn the original dose-ranging trial, patients were enrolled between December, 1992, and November, 1993, in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, the USA, and the UK if they had probable or definite ALS as defined by the El Escorial criteria. The censor date for the riluzole survival data was set as the original study end date of Dec 31, 1994. For this analysis, King's clinical ALS stage was estimated from the electronic case record data of the modified Norris scale, UK Medical Research Council score for muscle strength, El Escorial category, vital capacity, and gastrostomy insertion data. The lowest allocated stage was 2 because the original trial only included patients with probable or definite ALS. We used a χ 2 test to assess the independence of stage at trial enrolment and treatment group, Kaplan-Meier product limit distribution to test the transition from each stage to subsequent stages, and Cox regression to confirm an effect of treatment group on time in stage, controlling for covariates. We did sensitivity analyses by combining treatment groups, using alternative strategies to stage, stratifying by stage at trial enrolment, and using multistate outcome analysis of treatments (MOAT).\nFINDINGS\nWe analysed the case records of all 959 participants from the original dose-ranging trial, 237 assigned to 50 mg/day riluzole, 236 to 100 mg/day, 244 to 200 mg/day, and 242 to daily placebo. Clinical stage at enrolment did not significantly differ between treatment groups (p=0·22). Time in stage 4 was longer for patients receiving 100 mg/day riluzole than for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·55, 95% CI 0·36-0·83; log-rank p=0·037). Combining treatment groups and stratifying by stage at enrolment showed a similar result (HR 0·638, 95% CI 0·464-0·878; p=0·006), as did analysis with MOAT where the mean number of days spent in stage 4 was numerically higher for patients given riluzole at higher doses compared with patients receiving placebo. Time from stages 2 or 3 to subsequent stages or death did not differ between riluzole treatment groups and placebo (p=0·83 for stage 2 and 0·88 for stage 3).\nINTERPRETATION\nWe showed that riluzole prolongs survival in the last clinical stage of ALS; this finding needs to be confirmed in a prospective study, and treatment effects at stage 1 still need to be analysed. The ALS stage at which benefit occurs is important for counselling of patients before starting treatment. Staging should be used in future ALS clinical trials to assess the stage at which survival benefit occurs, and a similar approach could be used for other neurodegenerative diseases.\nFUNDING\nNIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre, The European Union Joint Programme on Neurodegeneration, and the King's Summer Undergraduate Studentship.", "year": "2018", "venue": "The Lancet.

The aim was to assess the cost implications of the life extension offered by riluzole through cost utility analysis based on patient assessed utilities of different health states.A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of Rilutek with best supportive care. Transition possibilities and the distribution of patients by health states were taken from a cohort of 954 patients drawn from a large randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial between 1992 and 1994 in the first 18 months and used to extrapolate the model to assess the long-term prolongation of life. Four distinct health states were used corresponding to mild, moderate, severe and terminal states. Costs associated with Rilutek included the acquisition cost and bi-monthly monitoring for raised ALT levels. Patient assessed utilities were collected by use of the standard gamble technique. 77 patients were entered into the study from two centres (King's, London and Preston) in the UK. Mean utilities for each of the health states was generated and, given that the data were skewed, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken with the median utility values. The implications of life extension offered by riluzole versus best supportive care were assessed both in terms of life extension projected and quality adjusted survival using patient based utilities. Using the Markov model and the transitional probabilities the base case cost per life year gained was estimated at pound sterlings 14,370 and applying Standard Gamble utility scores, the base case cost per QALY was assessed as pound sterlings 20,904. The effect of discounting costs and benefits altered the cost effectiveness analysis to pound sterlings 17,760 per life year gained while a sensitivity analysis around median or mean scores for the utility weight resulted in a range of pound sterlings 19,020 to pound sterlings 25,794 per QALY gained.", "year": "2001", "venue": "Journal of the neurological sciences"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:36:11.334427"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "8043057 riluzole amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "result": {"total": 1056, "data": [{"paperId": "22419278", "title": "Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nRiluzole is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries.

Currently, lactulose is the most studied in terms of medical use oligosaccharide with a high prebiotic index. The exact mechanisms of action of lactulose remain largely unknown despite a number of new researches based on modern methods of molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics. **The aim** of this review to summarize and analyze the actual information about biological activity, probable mechanisms of action, and possible uses of lactulose in human nutrition. **Results**. The structure of lactulose, methods for its determination and preparation are briefly described. Promising methods for producing lactulose include enzymatic synthesis from lactose using β-galactosidase or epimerase. Information on the physiological effects of lactulose and the mechanisms of its action on the human organism is presented. The works confirming the ability of lactulose to stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria and to influence the metabolism of the intestinal microbiota are summarized. The results of studies of the ability of lactulose to have antitoxic and anticarcinogenic effects are presented. The mechanisms of the positive effect of the prebiotic on the absorption of minerals, increased absorption of Ca and Mg in the human organism are described. The effect of lactulose on immunity and the possibility of its use to reduce the glucose blood level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are shown. The main directions of the use of lactulose in food production are systematized. The data confirming the possibility of using lactulose as a growth factor for probiotics, as well as a protective agent to increase the survival of some starter cultures, are presented. Brief information on the doses and forms of lactulose apply in medicine is presented. The dependence of the effects of lactulose on the dose, health condition and age of patients has been established. **Conclusion**. Perspective directions of lactulose using in combination with probiotics, other prebiotics, and as an encapsulating ingredient for vitamins and other functional nutrition ingredients are determined. In this regard, the study of lactulose interaction with the components of complex products is relevant. \\n**Keywords:** application; lactulose; mechanisms of action; physiological effects; prebiotic.

Diabetes & endocrinology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists differ in their structure and duration of action and have been studied in trials of varying sizes and with different patient populations, with inconsistent effects on cardiovascular outcomes reported. We aimed to synthesise the available evidence by doing a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials of these drugs.\nMETHODS\nWe searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for eligible placebo-controlled trials reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; ie, cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) up to June 15, 2019. We did a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate overall hazard ratios (HRs) for MACE, its components, death from any cause, hospital admission for heart failure, kidney outcomes, and key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE in several subgroups based on patient characteristics (history of cardiovascular disease, BMI, age, baseline HbA1c, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate), trial duration, treatment dosing interval, and structural homology.\nFINDINGS\nOf 27 publications screened, seven trials, with a combined total of 56 004 participants, were included: ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide), Harmony Outcomes (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), and PIONEER 6 (oral semaglutide). Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced MACE by 12% (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·82-0·94; p<0·0001). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity across the subgroups examined. HRs were 0·88 (95% CI 0·81-0·96; p=0·003) for death from cardiovascular causes, 0·84 (0·76-0·93; p<0·0001) for fatal or non-fatal stroke, and 0·91 (0·84-1·00; p=0·043) for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction. GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 12% (0·88, 0·83-0·95; p=0·001), hospital admission for heart failure by 9% (0·91, 0·83-0·99; p=0·028), and a broad composite kidney outcome (development of new-onset macroalbuminuria, decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [or increase in creatinine], progression to end-stage kidney disease, or death attributable to kidney causes) by 17% (0·83, 0·78-0·89; p<0·0001), mainly due to a reduction in urinary albumin excretion.

The primary outcome was a composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (major adverse CV event [MACE]) according to the presence of PAD at baseline.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1184/9340 (12.7%) patients in LEADER and 460/3297 (14.0%) in SUSTAIN 6 had PAD at baseline. Patients with PAD were at an ~35% increased risk of MACE versus those without (LEADER: hazard ratio [HR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.58; SUSTAIN 6: HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.94-1.83). The effects of both therapies on MACE were consistently beneficial in patients with PAD (liraglutide: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58-1.01; semaglutide: 0.61, 0.33-1.13) and without (liraglutide: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-1.00; semaglutide: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58-1.01; P interaction = .34 for liraglutide and .49 for semaglutide). Absolute risk reductions for MACE were higher in patients with PAD (liraglutide: 4.13%-point, 95% CI -0.15-8.42; semaglutide: 4.63%-point, 95% CI -0.58-9.84) versus without (liraglutide:1.42%-point, 95% CI -0.03-2.87; semaglutide: 1.90%-point, 95% CI 0.00-3.80).\nCONCLUSION\nBoth liraglutide and semaglutide reduce MACE with consistent CV efficacy regardless of PAD status.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32366578\">Title: Cardiovascular Risk Reduction With Liraglutide: An Exploratory Mediation Analysis of the LEADER Trial.\nAuthors: Buse, John B, Bain, Stephen C, Mann, Johannes F E et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Diabetes care\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nThe Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov reg. no. NCT01179048) demonstrated a reduced risk of cardiovascular (CV) events for patients with type 2 diabetes who received the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist liraglutide versus placebo. The mechanisms behind this CV benefit remain unclear. We aimed to identify potential mediators for the CV benefit observed with liraglutide in the LEADER trial.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe performed exploratory analyses to identify potential mediators of the effect of liraglutide on major adverse CV events (MACE; composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) from the following candidates: glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ), body weight, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), confirmed hypoglycemia, sulfonylurea use, insulin use, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol. These candidates were selected as CV risk factors on which liraglutide had an effect in LEADER such that a reduction in CV risk might result. We used two methods based on a Cox proportional hazards model and the new Vansteelandt method designed to use all available information from the mediator and to control for confounding factors.\nRESULTS\nAnalyses using the Cox methods and Vansteelandt method indicated potential mediation by HbA 1c (up to 41% and 83% mediation, respectively) and UACR (up to 29% and 33% mediation, respectively) on the effect of liraglutide on MACE. Mediation effects were small for other candidates.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese analyses identify HbA 1c and, to a lesser extent, UACR as potential mediators of the CV effects of liraglutide. Whether either is a marker of an unmeasured factor or a true mediator remains a key question that invites further investigation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30609236\">Title: Heart failure and type 2 diabetes: From cardiovascular outcome trials, with hope.\nAuthors: Giugliano, Dario, Meier, Juris J, Esposito, Katherine | Year: 2019 | Journal: Diabetes, obesity & metabolism\nAbstract: An excess risk of heart failure (HF) persists in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) despite optimal control of an array of conventional risk factors, including hyperglycaemia. Twelve cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have been published to date, although none, with the exception of the DECLARE trial with dapagliflozin, has included HF as a primary endpoint. The four trials with dipeptidyl-peptidase inhibitors (DPP-4i) (SAVOR-TIMI 53 with saxagliptin, EXAMINE with alogliptin, TECOS with sitagliptin and CARMELINA with linagliptin) failed to show any significant effect on HF risk in patients with T2D, with the notable exception of saxagliptin which was associated with a 27% increased risk. Five completed CVOTs with the GLP-1 RAs lixisenatide (ELIXA), liraglutide (LEADER), semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6), exenatide once weekly (EXSCEL) and albiglutide (HARMONY) also failed to reveal any significant effect on HF risk. The three trials with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) (EMPA-REG OUTCOME with empagliflozin, CANVAS with canagliflozin and DECLARE with dapagliflozin) all revealed a robust and significant reduction in the hazard ratios of hospitalization for HF, from 27% to 35%, which remained consistent, significant and of similar magnitude regardless of the presence of a history of HF or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. There is no association between reductions in HF risk and haemoglobin A1c (A1C) levels, while there is a significant association between reductions in HR for MACE and A1C levels (Spearman's correlation, r = 0.695; P = 0.013). All of the 12 CVOTs completed to date have provided reassurance of the overall cardiovascular safety of the newer anti-hyperglycaemic drugs. At present, the robust, consistent and reproducible reduction of approximately 30% in the risk of HF with SGLT-2i may be considered a class effect. The beneficial effect on MACE outcome observed with the use of some GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2i must be interpreted within the frame of the single trial.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40463568\">Title: Real-world cardiovascular effects of liraglutide: transportability analysis of the LEADER trial.\nAuthors: Josey, Kevin, Liu, Wenhui, Warsavage, Theodore et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate generalizability of the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) randomized clinical trial (RCT) - a cardiovascular outcomes study of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) liraglutide - to US Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) patients with diabetes, a population at high cardiovascular disease risk lacking direct RCT evidence of GLP-1RA efficacy.\nDESIGN\nTransportability analysis that integrates real-world and RCT data to estimate the average treatment effect of liraglutide versus placebo had LEADER enrolled VA diabetes patients.\nSETTING\nMulti-national RCT and US VA.\nPARTICIPANTS\n9,336 LEADER participants and 357,075 VA users with diabetes from 2015-2023.\nINTERVENTIONS\nLiraglutide versus placebo.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nRisk differences (RD) in survival probabilities and hazard ratios (HR) of trial-adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality, estimated with augmented inverse probability weighting after balancing baseline characteristics between LEADER participants and trial-eligible veterans using approximate balancing weights. Sensitivity analyses varied VA cohort composition and balancing variables.\nRESULTS\nTransported effects of liraglutide compared to placebo on MACE and all-cause mortality in veterans (\"VA-weighted LEADER\") consistently overlapped the treatment effects observed in LEADER: RD of 3-year MACE of 2.0% [95% CI 0.8, 3.2] in VA-weighted LEADER versus 1.6% [0.3, 2.9] in LEADER; MACE HR 0.74 [0.61, 0.90] in VA-weighted LEADER versus 0.87 [0.78, 0.97] in LEADER; RD of 3-year all-cause mortality of 1.5% [0.6, 2.4] in VA-weighted LEADER versus 0.9% [-0.09, 1.9] in LEADER; all-cause mortality HR 0.71 [0.57, 0.89] in VA-weighted LEADER versus 0.85 [0.74, 0.97] in LEADER. Results were robust to all sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe benefits of liraglutide observed in LEADER generalized to veterans with diabetes - real-world evidence that can guide diabetes treatment decisions for a high-risk population underrepresented in RCTs and inform formulary policies for an integrated healthcare system.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">27295427 liraglutide LEADER</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 163 results.

The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was that liraglutide would be noninferior to placebo with regard to the primary outcome, with a margin of 1.30 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio. No adjustments for multiplicity were performed for the prespecified exploratory outcomes.\nRESULTS\nA total of 9340 patients underwent randomization. The median follow-up was 3.8 years. The primary outcome occurred in significantly fewer patients in the liraglutide group (608 of 4668 patients [13.0%]) than in the placebo group (694 of 4672 [14.9%]) (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). Fewer patients died from cardiovascular causes in the liraglutide group (219 patients [4.7%]) than in the placebo group (278 [6.0%]) (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P=0.007). The rate of death from any cause was lower in the liraglutide group (381 patients [8.2%]) than in the placebo group (447 [9.6%]) (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97; P=0.02). The rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure were nonsignificantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. The most common adverse events leading to the discontinuation of liraglutide were gastrointestinal events. The incidence of pancreatitis was nonsignificantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the time-to-event analysis, the rate of the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was lower with liraglutide than with placebo.

In the pooled analysis, semaglutide/liraglutide lowered albuminuria from baseline to 2 years after randomization by 24% versus placebo (95% CI, 20%-27%; P <0.001). Significant reductions were also observed in by-trial data analyses ( P <0.001 for all), the largest being with semaglutide 1.0 mg (33% [95% CI, 24%-40%]; P <0.001) at 2 years. With semaglutide 1.0 mg and liraglutide, eGFR slope decline was significantly slowed by 0.87 and 0.26 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /y ( P <0.0001 and P <0.001), respectively, versus placebo. Effects appeared larger in patients with baseline eGFR <60 versus ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ( P interaction =0.06 and 0.008 for semaglutide 1.0 mg and liraglutide, respectively). Semaglutide/liraglutide significantly lowered risk of persistent 40% and 50% eGFR reductions versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.99]; P =0.039 and HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66-0.97]; P =0.023, respectively). Similar, nonsignificant, directional results were observed for 30% and 57% eGFR reductions (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.02]; P =0.10 and HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.69-1.13]; P =0.34). In patients with baseline eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , the likelihood of persistent reduction for all thresholds was increased, ranging from HR 0.71 for 30% reduction (95% CI, 0.59-0.85; P =0.0003, P interaction =0.017) to 0.54 for 57% reduction (95% CI, 0.36-0.81; P =0.003, P interaction =0.035).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide/liraglutide offered kidney-protective effects, which appeared more pronounced in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28854085\">Title: Liraglutide and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.\nAuthors: Mann, Johannes F E, Ørsted, David D, Brown-Frandsen, Kirstine et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn a randomized, controlled trial that compared liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk who were receiving usual care, we found that liraglutide resulted in lower risks of the primary end point (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) and death. However, the long-term effects of liraglutide on renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.\nMETHODS\nWe report the prespecified secondary renal outcomes of that randomized, controlled trial in which patients were assigned to receive liraglutide or placebo. The secondary renal outcome was a composite of new-onset persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death due to renal disease. The risk of renal outcomes was determined with the use of time-to-event analyses with an intention-to-treat approach. Changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria were also analyzed.\nRESULTS\nA total of 9340 patients underwent randomization, and the median follow-up of the patients was 3.84 years. The renal outcome occurred in fewer participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (268 of 4668 patients vs. 337 of 4672; hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67 to 0.92; P=0.003). This result was driven primarily by the new onset of persistent macroalbuminuria, which occurred in fewer participants in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group (161 vs. 215 patients; hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.91; P=0.004). The rates of renal adverse events were similar in the liraglutide group and the placebo group (15.1 events and 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years), including the rate of acute kidney injury (7.1 and 6.2 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis prespecified secondary analysis shows that, when added to usual care, liraglutide resulted in lower rates of the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease than placebo.

Diabetes & endocrinology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective glucose-lowering drugs. Findings from cardiovascular outcome trials showed cardiovascular safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists, but results for cardiovascular efficacy were varied. We aimed to examine overall cardiovascular efficacy for lixisenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and extended-release exenatide.\nMETHODS\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analysed data from eligible trials that assessed the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with placebo in adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with type 2 diabetes and had a primary outcome including, but not limited to, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. We searched PubMed and MEDLINE without language restrictions up to Sept 18, 2017, for eligible trials. We did a meta-analysis of available trial data using a random-effects model to calculate overall hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular efficacy outcomes and odds ratios for key safety outcomes.\nFINDINGS\nOf 12 articles identified in our search and screened for eligibility, four trials of cardiovascular outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists were identified: ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide), and EXSCEL (extended-release exenatide). Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment showed a significant 10% relative risk reduction in the three-point major adverse cardiovascular event primary outcome (cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke; HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·82-0·99; p=0·033), a 13% RRR in cardiovascular mortality (0·87, 0·79-0·96; p=0·007), and a 12% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (0·88, 0·81-0·95; p=0·002), with low-to-moderate between-trial statistical heterogeneity. No significant effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists was identified on fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or hospital admission for heart failure. Overall, no significant differences were seen in severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or medullary thyroid cancer reported between GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment and placebo.\nINTERPRETATION\nOur findings show cardiovascular safety across all GLP-1 receptor agonist cardiovascular outcome trials and suggest that drugs in this class can reduce three-point major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality risk, albeit to varying degrees for individual drugs, without significant safety concerns. GLP-1 receptor agonists have a favourable risk-benefit balance overall, which should allow the choice of drug to be individualised to each patient's needs.\nFUNDING\nAmylin Pharmaceuticals (AstraZeneca).</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">31189511 dulaglutide REWIND MACE</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 13 results.

HRs were 0·88 (95% CI 0·81-0·96; p=0·003) for death from cardiovascular causes, 0·84 (0·76-0·93; p<0·0001) for fatal or non-fatal stroke, and 0·91 (0·84-1·00; p=0·043) for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction. GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 12% (0·88, 0·83-0·95; p=0·001), hospital admission for heart failure by 9% (0·91, 0·83-0·99; p=0·028), and a broad composite kidney outcome (development of new-onset macroalbuminuria, decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [or increase in creatinine], progression to end-stage kidney disease, or death attributable to kidney causes) by 17% (0·83, 0·78-0·89; p<0·0001), mainly due to a reduction in urinary albumin excretion.

This article expores the relationship of selected biomarkers to both dulaglutide and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nIn this post hoc analysis, stored fasting baseline and 2-year plasma samples from 824 REWIND participants with MACE during follow-up and 845 matched non-MACE participants were analyzed for 2-year changes in 19 protein biomarkers. Two-year changes in 135 metabolites were also analyzed in 600 participants with MACE during follow-up and in 601 matched non-MACE participants. Linear and logistic regression models were used to identify proteins that were associated with both dulaglutide treatment and MACE. Similar models were used to identify metabolites that were associated with both dulaglutide treatment and MACE.\nRESULTS\nCompared with placebo, dulaglutide was associated with a greater reduction or lesser 2-year rise from baseline in N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and a greater 2-year rise in C-peptide. Compared with placebo, dulaglutide was also associated with a greater fall from baseline in 2-hydroxybutyric acid and a greater rise in threonine (P < 0.001). Increases from baseline in two of the proteins (but neither metabolite) were associated with MACE, including NT-proBNP (OR 1.267; 95% CI 1.119, 1.435; P < 0.001) and GDF-15 (OR 1.937; 95% CI 1.424, 2.634; P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nDulaglutide was associated with a reduced 2-year rise from baseline of NT-proBNP and GDF-15. Higher rises of these biomarkers were also associated with MACE.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34563178\">Title: Exploring potential mediators of the cardiovascular benefit of dulaglutide in type 2 diabetes patients in REWIND.\nAuthors: Konig, Manige, Riddle, Matthew C, Colhoun, Helen M et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Cardiovascular diabetology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe REWIND trial demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefits to patients with type 2 diabetes and multiple CV risk factors or established CV disease. This exploratory analysis evaluated the degree to which the effect of dulaglutide on CV risk factors could statistically account for its effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the REWIND trial.\nMETHODS\nPotential mediators of established CV risk factors that were significantly reduced by dulaglutide were assessed in a post hoc analysis using repeated measures mixed models and included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR). These factors, for which the change in level during follow-up was significantly associated with incident MACE, were identified using Cox regression modeling. Each identified variable was then included as a covariate in the Cox model assessing the effect of dulaglutide on MACE to estimate the degree to which the hazard ratio of dulaglutide vs placebo was attenuated. The combined effect of the variables associated with attenuation was assessed by including all variables in an additional Cox model.\nRESULTS\nAlthough all evaluated variables were significantly improved by treatment, only changes in HbA1c and UACR were associated with MACE and a reduction in the effect of dulaglutide on this outcome was observed. The observed hazard ratio for MACE for dulaglutide vs placebo reduced by 36.1% by the updated mean HbA1c, and by 28.5% by the updated mean UACR. A similar pattern was observed for change from baseline in HbA1c and UACR and a reduction of 16.7% and 25.4%, respectively in the hazard ratio for MACE with dulaglutide vs placebo was observed. When HbA1c and UACR were both included, the observed hazard ratio reduced by 65.4% for the updated mean and 41.7% for the change from baseline with no HbA1c-UACR interaction (P interaction = 0.75 and 0.15, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment-induced improvement in HbA1c and UACR, but not changes in weight, systolic blood pressure, or LDL cholesterol, appear to partly mediate the beneficial effects of dulaglutide on MACE outcomes. These observations suggest that the proven effects of dulaglutide on cardiovascular disease benefit are partially related to changes in glycemic control and albuminuria, with residual unexplained benefit.

Its efficacy and safety in older vs younger patients have not been explicitly analyzed.\nOBJECTIVE\nThis work aimed to assess efficacy and safety of dulaglutide vs placebo in REWIND by age subgroups (≥ 65 and < 65 years).\nMETHODS\nA post hoc subgroup analysis of REWIND was conducted at 371 sites in 24 countries. Participants included type 2 diabetes patients aged 50 years or older with established cardiovascular (CV) disease or multiple CV risk factors, and a wide range of glycemic control. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to dulaglutide 1.5 mg or placebo as an add-on to country-specific standard of care. Main outcomes measures included MACE (first occurrence of the composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from CV or unknown causes).\nRESULTS\nThere were 5256 randomly assigned patients who were 65 years or older (mean = 71.0), and 4645 were younger than 65 years (mean = 60.7). Baseline characteristics were similar in randomized treatment groups. Dulaglutide treatment showed a similar reduction in the incidence (11% vs 13%) of MACE in older vs younger patients. The rate of permanent study drug discontinuation, incidence of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations for heart failure, severe hypoglycemia, severe renal or urinary events, and serious gastrointestinal events were similar between randomized treatment groups within each age subgroup. The incidence rate of serious cardiac conduction disorders was numerically higher in the dulaglutide group compared to placebo within each age subgroup but the difference was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION\nDulaglutide had similar efficacy and safety in REWIND in patients65 years and older and those younger than 65 years.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36073143\">Title: Dulaglutide and cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes in patients with and without heart failure: a post-hoc analysis from the REWIND randomized trial.\nAuthors: Branch, Kelley R H, Dagenais, Gilles R, Avezum, Alvaro et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: European journal of heart failure\nAbstract: AIMS\nPeople with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular events including heart failure (HF). We examined the effect of the glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist dulaglutide on incident HF events and other cardiovascular outcomes in those with or without prior HF in the randomized placebo-controlled Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe REWIND major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) outcome was the first occurrence of a composite endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (including unknown causes). In this post-hoc analysis, a HF event was defined as an adjudication-confirmed hospitalization or urgent evaluation for HF. Of the 9901 participants studied over a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 213/4949 (4.3%) randomly assigned to dulaglutide and 226/4952 (4.6%) participants assigned to placebo experienced a HF event (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-1.12; p = 0.456). In the 853 (8.6%) participants with HF at baseline, there was no change in either MACE or HF events with dulaglutide as compared to participants without HF (p = 0.44 and 0.19 for interaction, respectively). Combined cardiovascular death and HF events were marginally reduced with dulaglutide compared to placebo (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-1.00; p = 0.050) but unchanged in patients with and without HF at baseline (p = 0.31).\nCONCLUSIONS\nDulaglutide was not associated with a reduction in HF events in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of baseline HF status over 5.4 years of follow-up.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">31189511 REWIND dulaglutide</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 48 results.

Neurology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nDiabetes is an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. We aimed to investigate the association between the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist dulaglutide and cognitive impairment as an exploratory analysis within the Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial.\nMETHODS\nREWIND is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at 371 sites in 24 countries. We included men and women (aged ≥50 years) with either established or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and additional cardiovascular risk factors, glycated haemoglobin of up to 9·5% (80 mmol/mol) on a maximum of two oral glucose-lowering drugs with or without basal insulin, and a body-mass index of at least 23 kg/m 2 . Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) subcutaneous injections once a week of either dulaglutide (1·5 mg) or an equal volume of matching placebo. Randomisation was done using a computer-generated code with stratification by site. Participants and all study personnel were masked to treatment allocation until the database was locked. Participants were followed up at least every 6 months for the composite primary outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from cardiovascular or unknown causes. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and during follow-up using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). We present here the exploratory primary cognitive outcome, which was the first occurrence of a follow-up score on MoCA or DSST that was 1·5 SDs or more below the baseline mean score in the participant's country. All analyses were done using an intention-to-treat approach. The REWIND trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01394952.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Aug 18, 2011, and Aug 14, 2013, 9901 participants were randomly assigned to either dulaglutide (n=4949) or placebo (n=4952). During median follow-up of 5·4 (IQR 5·1-5·9) years, 8828 participants provided a baseline and one or more follow-up MoCA or DSST scores, of whom 4456 were assigned dulaglutide and 4372 were assigned placebo. The cognitive outcome occurred in 4·05 per 100 patient-years in participants assigned dulaglutide and 4·35 per 100 patient-years in people assigned placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·93, 95% CI 0·85-1·02; p=0·11). After post-hoc adjustment for individual standardised baseline scores, the hazard of substantive cognitive impairment was reduced by 14% in those assigned dulaglutide (HR 0·86, 95% CI 0·79-0·95; p=0·0018).\nINTERPRETATION\nLong-term treatment with dulaglutide might reduce cognitive impairment in people with type 2 diabetes.

We assessed the long-term effect of the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide on renal outcomes in an exploratory analysis of the REWIND trial of the effect of dulaglutide on cardiovascular disease.\nMETHODS\nREWIND was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 371 sites in 24 countries. Men and women aged at least 50 years with type 2 diabetes who had either a previous cardiovascular event or cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned (1:1) to either weekly subcutaneous injection of dulaglutide (1·5 mg) or placebo and followed up at least every 6 months for outcomes. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios (UACRs) and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were estimated from urine and serum values measured in local laboratories every 12 months. The primary outcome (first occurrence of the composite endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes), secondary outcomes (including a composite microvascular outcome), and safety outcomes of this trial have been reported elsewhere. In this exploratory analysis, we investigate the renal component of the composite microvascular outcome, defined as the first occurrence of new macroalbuminuria (UACR >33·9 mg/mmol), a sustained decline in eGFR of 30% or more from baseline, or chronic renal replacement therapy.

These candidates were selected as CV risk factors on which liraglutide had an effect in LEADER such that a reduction in CV risk might result. We used two methods based on a Cox proportional hazards model and the new Vansteelandt method designed to use all available information from the mediator and to control for confounding factors.\nRESULTS\nAnalyses using the Cox methods and Vansteelandt method indicated potential mediation by HbA 1c (up to 41% and 83% mediation, respectively) and UACR (up to 29% and 33% mediation, respectively) on the effect of liraglutide on MACE.

Increases from baseline in two of the proteins (but neither metabolite) were associated with MACE, including NT-proBNP (OR 1.267; 95% CI 1.119, 1.435; P < 0.001) and GDF-15 (OR 1.937; 95% CI 1.424, 2.634; P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nDulaglutide was associated with a reduced 2-year rise from baseline of NT-proBNP and GDF-15.

This exploratory analysis evaluated the degree to which the effect of dulaglutide on CV risk factors could statistically account for its effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the REWIND trial.\nMETHODS\nPotential mediators of established CV risk factors that were significantly reduced by dulaglutide were assessed in a post hoc analysis using repeated measures mixed models and included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR). These factors, for which the change in level during follow-up was significantly associated with incident MACE, were identified using Cox regression modeling. Each identified variable was then included as a covariate in the Cox model assessing the effect of dulaglutide on MACE to estimate the degree to which the hazard ratio of dulaglutide vs placebo was attenuated. The combined effect of the variables associated with attenuation was assessed by including all variables in an additional Cox model.\nRESULTS\nAlthough all evaluated variables were significantly improved by treatment, only changes in HbA1c and UACR were associated with MACE and a reduction in the effect of dulaglutide on this outcome was observed. The observed hazard ratio for MACE for dulaglutide vs placebo reduced by 36.1% by the updated mean HbA1c, and by 28.5% by the updated mean UACR. A similar pattern was observed for change from baseline in HbA1c and UACR and a reduction of 16.7% and 25.4%, respectively in the hazard ratio for MACE with dulaglutide vs placebo was observed. When HbA1c and UACR were both included, the observed hazard ratio reduced by 65.4% for the updated mean and 41.7% for the change from baseline with no HbA1c-UACR interaction (P interaction = 0.75 and 0.15, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment-induced improvement in HbA1c and UACR, but not changes in weight, systolic blood pressure, or LDL cholesterol, appear to partly mediate the beneficial effects of dulaglutide on MACE outcomes. These observations suggest that the proven effects of dulaglutide on cardiovascular disease benefit are partially related to changes in glycemic control and albuminuria, with residual unexplained benefit.

The CRISPR-associated catalytically inactive dCas9 protein offers a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting. Here, we show that fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in human and yeast cells, with the site of delivery determined solely by a coexpressed short guide (sg)RNA. Coupling of dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain can robustly silence expression of multiple endogenous genes. RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence, revealing the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33934834\">Title: CRISPR interference and its applications.\nAuthors: Ghavami, Seyedkhashayar, Pandi, Amir | Year: 2021 | Journal: Progress in molecular biology and translational science\nAbstract: Sequence-specific control of gene expression is a powerful tool for identifying and studying gene functions and cellular processes. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is an RNA-based method for highly specific silencing of the transcription in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. The typical CRISPRi system is a type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) machinery of Streptococcus pyogenes. CRISPRi requires two main components: A catalytically inactivated Cas9, namely dCas9 and a guide RNA (sgRNA). These two components associate and form a DNA recognition complex. The dCas9/sgRNA complex then specifically binds to the target DNA complementary with the sgRNA and sterically prevents the association of the promoter or transcription factors with their trans-acting sequences or blocks the transcription elongation. This chapter discusses CRISPRi structure, mechanism and its applications.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33020655\">Title: An efficient KRAB domain for CRISPRi applications in human cells.\nAuthors: Alerasool, Nader, Segal, Dmitri, Lee, Hunsang et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Nature methods\nAbstract: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi), based on the fusion of inactive Cas9 (dCas9) to the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor, is a powerful platform for silencing gene expression. However, it suffers from incomplete silencing of target genes. We assayed 57 KRAB domains for their repressive potency and identified the ZIM3 KRAB domain as an exceptionally potent repressor. We establish that ZIM3 KRAB-dCas9 fusion silences gene expression more efficiently than existing platforms.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36576240\">Title: Maximizing CRISPRi efficacy and accessibility with dual-sgRNA libraries and optimal effectors.\nAuthors: Replogle, Joseph M, Bonnar, Jessica L, Pogson, Angela N et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: eLife\nAbstract: CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal non-specific effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown. Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi genetic screening.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39426588\">Title: CRISPR innovations in tissue engineering and gene editing.\nAuthors: Razavi, ZahraSadat, Soltani, Madjid, Souri, Mohammad et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Life sciences\nAbstract: The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful tool for genome editing, utilizing the Cas9 nuclease and programmable single guide RNA (sgRNA). However, the Cas9 nuclease activity can be disabled by mutation, resulting in catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9). By combining the customizable sgRNA with dCas9, researchers can inhibit specific gene expression (CRISPR interference, CRISPRi) or activate the expression of a target gene (CRISPR activation, CRISPRa). In this review, we present the principles and recent advancements of these CRISPR technologies, as well as their delivery vectors. We also explore their applications in stem cell engineering and regenerative medicine, with a focus on in vitro stem cell fate manipulation and in vivo treatments. These include the prevention of retinal and muscular degeneration, neural regeneration, bone regeneration, cartilage tissue engineering, and the treatment of blood, skin, and liver diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of translating CRISPR technologies into regenerative medicine and provide future perspectives.

Here, we develop a method for controlling gene expression based on Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease from a type II CRISPR system. We show that a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide RNA, generates a DNA recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells. This RNA-guided DNA recognition platform provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"23849981\">Title: CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.\nAuthors: Gilbert, Luke A, Larson, Matthew H, Morsut, Leonardo et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Cell\nAbstract: The genetic interrogation and reprogramming of cells requires methods for robust and precise targeting of genes for expression or repression. The CRISPR-associated catalytically inactive dCas9 protein offers a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting. Here, we show that fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in human and yeast cells, with the site of delivery determined solely by a coexpressed short guide (sg)RNA. Coupling of dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain can robustly silence expression of multiple endogenous genes. RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence, revealing the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24136345\">Title: CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) for sequence-specific control of gene expression.\nAuthors: Larson, Matthew H, Gilbert, Luke A, Wang, Xiaowo et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Nature protocols\nAbstract: Sequence-specific control of gene expression on a genome-wide scale is an important approach for understanding gene functions and for engineering genetic regulatory systems. We have recently described an RNA-based method, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), for targeted silencing of transcription in bacteria and human cells. The CRISPRi system is derived from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) pathway, requiring only the coexpression of a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA). The Cas9-sgRNA complex binds to DNA elements complementary to the sgRNA and causes a steric block that halts transcript elongation by RNA polymerase, resulting in the repression of the target gene. Here we provide a protocol for the design, construction and expression of customized sgRNAs for transcriptional repression of any gene of interest. We also provide details for testing the repression activity of CRISPRi using quantitative fluorescence assays and native elongating transcript sequencing. CRISPRi provides a simplified approach for rapid gene repression within 1-2 weeks. The method can also be adapted for high-throughput interrogation of genome-wide gene functions and genetic interactions, thus providing a complementary approach to RNA interference, which can be used in a wider variety of organisms.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23452860/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<answer>\nPMID **23892889** does not appear to be the canonical bacterial dCas9 “CRISPRi” paper.

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.

In phase 3 development, lecanemab has been shown to reduce markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and reduce decline on clinical endpoints of cognition and function at 18 months.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo describe the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) results from Clarity AD which were exploratory outcomes in this trial.\nDESIGN\nClarity AD was an 18-month, multi-center, double-blind, phase 3 trial.\nSETTING\nEarly Alzheimer's disease.\nPARTICIPANTS\nIndividuals 50-90 years of age with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid evidence of cerebral amyloid accumulation.\nINTERVENTION\nPlacebo or lecanemab 10-mg/kg IV biweekly.\nMEASUREMENTS\nHRQoL was measured at baseline and every 6 months using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L; by subject) and Quality of Life in AD (QOL-AD; by subject and proxy). Study partner burden was measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled (lecanemab:898; placebo:897). At month 18, adjusted mean change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L and QOL-AD by subject showed 49% and 56% less decline, respectively. QOL-AD rated by study partner as proxy resulted in 23% less decline. ZBI adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months resulted in 38% less increase of care partner burden. Individual HRQoL test items and dimensions also showed lecanemab benefit.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was associated with a relative preservation of HRQoL and less increase in caregiver burden, with consistent benefits seen across different quality of life scales and within scale subdomains. These benefits provide valuable patient reported outcomes which, together with previously reported benefits of lecanemab across multiple measures of cognition, function, disease progression, and biomarkers, demonstrate that lecanemab treatment may offer meaningful benefits to patients, care partners, and society.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40189473\">Title: Clarity AD: Asian regional analysis of a phase III trial of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Chen, Christopher, Katayama, Sadao, Lee, Jae-Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAcross Asia, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to rise dramatically due to, among other factors, rapidly aging populations. Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38730496\">Title: Updated safety results from phase 3 lecanemab study in early Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Honig, Lawrence S, Sabbagh, Marwan N, van Dyck, Christopher H et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is a major health problem of aging, with tremendous burden on healthcare systems, patients, and families globally. Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3-6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E. Clinicians, participants, and caregivers should understand the incidence, monitoring, and management of these events for optimal patient care.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov numbers: Clarity AD NCT03887455).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33865446\">Title: A randomized, double-blind, phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial in early Alzheimer's disease with lecanemab, an anti-Aβ protofibril antibody.\nAuthors: Swanson, Chad J, Zhang, Yong, Dhadda, Shobha et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nLecanemab (BAN2401), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, preferentially targets soluble aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ), with activity across oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils. BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia.\nMETHODS\nBAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging.\nRESULTS\nA total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints.

Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes.\nRESULTS\nAmong 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.02 (95% CI, -7.01 to -5.03) in the donanemab group and -9.27 (95% CI, -10.23 to -8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and -10.2 (95% CI, -11.22 to -9.16) with donanemab and -13.1 (95% CI, -14.10 to -12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P < .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45]; P < .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36094645\">Title: Association of Amyloid Reduction After Donanemab Treatment With Tau Pathology and Clinical Outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Shcherbinin, Sergey, Evans, Cynthia D, Lu, Ming et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nβ-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits biologically define Alzheimer disease.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo perform post hoc analyses of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment and assess its association with tau pathology and clinical measures.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ) was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, with a double-blind period of up to 76 weeks and a 48-week follow-up period. The study was conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada. Enrolled were participants from 60 to 85 years of age with gradual and progressive change in memory function for 6 months or more, early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nDonanemab (an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate β-amyloid epitope) dosing was every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations occurred at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in amyloid, tau, and clinical decline after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nThe primary study randomized 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 female participants [53.3%]). The trial excluded 1683 of 1955 individuals screened. The rate of donanemab-induced amyloid reduction at 24 weeks was moderately correlated with the amount of baseline amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.39; P &lt; .001). Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResults of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence. Data from other trials will be important to confirm aforementioned observations, particularly treatment response by APOE ε4 status.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40063015\">Title: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities With Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.\nAuthors: Zimmer, Jennifer A, Ardayfio, Paul, Wang, Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThese prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36251300\">Title: Association of Donanemab Treatment With Exploratory Plasma Biomarkers in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Pontecorvo, Michael J, Lu, Ming, Burnham, Samantha C et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nPlasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease may be useful as minimally invasive pharmacodynamic measures of treatment outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo analyze the association of donanemab treatment with plasma biomarkers associated with Alzheimer disease.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, across 56 sites in the US and Canada.

Changes in plasma pTau217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly correlated with the Centiloid percent change in amyloid (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [R] = 0.484 [95% CI, 0.359-0.592]; P < .001 and R = 0.453 [95% CI, 0.306-0.579]; P < .001, respectively) following treatment. Additionally, plasma levels of pTau217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly correlated at baseline and following treatment (R = 0.399 [95% CI, 0.278-0.508], P < .001 and R = 0.393 [95% CI, 0.254-0.517]; P < .001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nSignificant reductions in plasma biomarkers pTau217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein compared with placebo were observed following donanemab treatment in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease. These easily accessible plasma biomarkers might provide additional evidence of Alzheimer disease pathology change through anti-amyloid therapy. Usefulness in assessing treatment response will require further evaluation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33720637\">Title: Donanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease.\nAuthors: Mintun, Mark A, Lo, Albert C, Duggan Evans, Cynthia et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nA hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS; range, 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment) at 76 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 13 ), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the change in the amyloid and tau burden on PET.\nRESULTS\nA total of 257 patients were enrolled; 131 were assigned to receive donanemab and 126 to receive placebo.

Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes.\nRESULTS\nAmong 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.02 (95% CI, -7.01 to -5.03) in the donanemab group and -9.27 (95% CI, -10.23 to -8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and -10.2 (95% CI, -11.22 to -9.16) with donanemab and -13.1 (95% CI, -14.10 to -12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P < .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45]; P < .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33720637\">Title: Donanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease.\nAuthors: Mintun, Mark A, Lo, Albert C, Duggan Evans, Cynthia et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nA hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide.

The clinical benefit achieved in these trials has been modest, however, highlighting the need for both a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and the importance of intervening early in the pathogenic cascade. An immunoprevention strategy for Alzheimer's disease is required that will integrate the findings from clinical trials with mechanistic insights from preclinical disease models to select promising antibodies, optimize the timing of intervention, identify early biomarkers, and mitigate potential side effects.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36094645\">Title: Association of Amyloid Reduction After Donanemab Treatment With Tau Pathology and Clinical Outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Shcherbinin, Sergey, Evans, Cynthia D, Lu, Ming et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nβ-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits biologically define Alzheimer disease.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo perform post hoc analyses of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment and assess its association with tau pathology and clinical measures.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ) was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, with a double-blind period of up to 76 weeks and a 48-week follow-up period. The study was conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada. Enrolled were participants from 60 to 85 years of age with gradual and progressive change in memory function for 6 months or more, early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nDonanemab (an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate β-amyloid epitope) dosing was every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations occurred at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in amyloid, tau, and clinical decline after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nThe primary study randomized 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 female participants [53.3%]). The trial excluded 1683 of 1955 individuals screened. The rate of donanemab-induced amyloid reduction at 24 weeks was moderately correlated with the amount of baseline amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.39; P &lt; .001). Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResults of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence.

Appropriate Use Recommendations (AURs) are intended to help guide the introduction of new therapies into real-world clinical practice. Community dwelling patients with AD differ from those participating in clinical trials. Administration of lecanemab at clinical trial sites by individuals experienced with monoclonal antibody therapy also differs from the community clinic-based administration of lecanemab. These AURs use clinical trial data as well as research and care information regarding AD to help clinicians administer lecanemab with optimal safety and opportunity for effectiveness. Safety and efficacy of lecanemab are known only for patients like those participating in the phase 2 and phase 3 lecanemab trials, and these AURs adhere closely to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials. Adverse events may occur with lecanemab including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. Monitoring guidelines for these events are detailed in this AUR. Most ARIA with lecanemab is asymptomatic, but a few cases are serious or, very rarely, fatal. Microhemorrhages and rare macrohemorrhages may occur in patients receiving lecanemab. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhage, and the AUR recommends that patients requiring anticoagulants not receive lecanemab until more data regarding this interaction are available. Patients who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) gene carriers, especially APOE4 homozygotes, are at higher risk for ARIA, and the AUR recommends APOE genotyping to better inform risk discussions with patients who are lecanemab candidates. Clinician and institutional preparedness are mandatory for use of lecanemab, and protocols for management of serious events should be developed and implemented. Communication between clinicians and therapy candidates or those on therapy is a key element of good clinical practice for the use of lecanemab. Patients and their care partners must understand the potential benefits, the potential harms, and the monitoring requirements for treatment with this agent. Culture-specific communication and building of trust between clinicians and patients are the foundation for successful use of lecanemab.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">34670036 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 32 results.

Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThese prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring.

Exploratory biomarkers were prespecified with the post hoc addition of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and amyloid-β. Men and women aged 60 to 85 years with gradual and progressive change in memory function for at least 6 months were included. A total of 1955 participants were assessed for eligibility. Key eligibility criteria include Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 20 to 28 and elevated amyloid and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nRandomized participants received donanemab or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The first 3 doses of donanemab were given at 700 mg and then increased to 1400 mg with blinded dose reductions as specified based on amyloid reduction.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in plasma biomarker levels after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nIn TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 [53.3%] female) were randomized. Plasma levels of phosphorylated tau217 (pTau217) and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly lower with donanemab treatment compared with placebo as early as 12 weeks after the start of treatment (least square mean change difference vs placebo, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.02]; P = .002 and -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01]; P = .01, respectively). No significant differences in plasma levels of amyloid-β 42/40 and neurofilament light chain were observed between treatment arms at the end of treatment. Changes in plasma pTau217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly correlated with the Centiloid percent change in amyloid (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [R] = 0.484 [95% CI, 0.359-0.592]; P < .001 and R = 0.453 [95% CI, 0.306-0.579]; P < .001, respectively) following treatment. Additionally, plasma levels of pTau217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly correlated at baseline and following treatment (R = 0.399 [95% CI, 0.278-0.508], P < .001 and R = 0.393 [95% CI, 0.254-0.517]; P < .001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nSignificant reductions in plasma biomarkers pTau217 and glial fibrillary acidic protein compared with placebo were observed following donanemab treatment in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease. These easily accessible plasma biomarkers might provide additional evidence of Alzheimer disease pathology change through anti-amyloid therapy. Usefulness in assessing treatment response will require further evaluation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403.</snippet>\n</tool_output>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36449413/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36449413/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease \\nN Engl J Med. 2023 Jan 5;388(1):9-21. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2212948.

The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001).

Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks.

Lecanemab, an FDA-approved amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody indicated for the treatment of early AD, binds with high affinity to soluble Aβ protofibrils, which have been shown to be more toxic to neurons than monomers or insoluble fibrils. Lecanemab has been shown to be well tolerated in multiple clinical trials, although risks include an increased rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions relative to placebo.\nMETHODS\nClarity AD was an 18-month treatment (Core study), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with open-label extension (OLE) in participants with early AD. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly). Safety evaluations included monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. ARIA occurrence was monitored throughout the study by magnetic resonance imaging, read both locally and centrally.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 1795 participants from Core and 1612 participants with at least one dose of lecanemab (Core + OLE) were included. Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated in Clarity AD, with no deaths related to lecanemab in the Core study. There were 9 deaths during the OLE, with 4 deemed possibly related to study treatment. Of the 24 deaths in Core + OLE, 3 were due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): 1 placebo in the Core due to ICH, and 2 lecanemab in OLE with concurrent ICH (1 on tissue plasminogen activator and 1 on anticoagulant therapy). In the Core + OLE, the most common adverse events in the lecanemab group (> 10%) were infusion-related reactions (24.5%), ARIA with hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H) microhemorrhages (16.0%), COVID-19 (14.7%), ARIA with edema (ARIA-E; 13.6%), and headache (10.3%). ARIA-E and ARIA-H were largely radiographically mild-to-moderate. ARIA-E generally occurred within 3-6 months of treatment, was more common in ApoE e4 carriers (16.8%) and most common in ApoE ε4 homozygous participants (34.5%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H, ARIA-E.

The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.", "year": "2025", "venue": "JAMA neurology"}, {"paperId": "36251300", "title": "Association of Donanemab Treatment With Exploratory Plasma Biomarkers in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nPlasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease may be useful as minimally invasive pharmacodynamic measures of treatment outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo analyze the association of donanemab treatment with plasma biomarkers associated with Alzheimer disease.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, across 56 sites in the US and Canada. Exploratory biomarkers were prespecified with the post hoc addition of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and amyloid-β.

Key eligibility criteria include Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 20 to 28 and elevated amyloid and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nRandomized participants received donanemab or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The first 3 doses of donanemab were given at 700 mg and then increased to 1400 mg with blinded dose reductions as specified based on amyloid reduction.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in plasma biomarker levels after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nIn TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 [53.3%] female) were randomized. Plasma levels of phosphorylated tau217 (pTau217) and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly lower with donanemab treatment compared with placebo as early as 12 weeks after the start of treatment (least square mean change difference vs placebo, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.02]; P = .002 and -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01]; P = .01, respectively). No significant differences in plasma levels of amyloid-β 42/40 and neurofilament light chain were observed between treatment arms at the end of treatment.

Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region.

Administration of lecanemab at clinical trial sites by individuals experienced with monoclonal antibody therapy also differs from the community clinic-based administration of lecanemab.

Adverse events may occur with lecanemab including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. Monitoring guidelines for these events are detailed in this AUR. Most ARIA with lecanemab is asymptomatic, but a few cases are serious or, very rarely, fatal. Microhemorrhages and rare macrohemorrhages may occur in patients receiving lecanemab. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhage, and the AUR recommends that patients requiring anticoagulants not receive lecanemab until more data regarding this interaction are available. Patients who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) gene carriers, especially APOE4 homozygotes, are at higher risk for ARIA, and the AUR recommends APOE genotyping to better inform risk discussions with patients who are lecanemab candidates. Clinician and institutional preparedness are mandatory for use of lecanemab, and protocols for management of serious events should be developed and implemented.

Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.", "year": "2025", "venue": "JAMA neurology"}, {"paperId": "36094645", "title": "Association of Amyloid Reduction After Donanemab Treatment With Tau Pathology and Clinical Outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nβ-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits biologically define Alzheimer disease.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo perform post hoc analyses of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment and assess its association with tau pathology and clinical measures.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThe Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ) was a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, with a double-blind period of up to 76 weeks and a 48-week follow-up period. The study was conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada. Enrolled were participants from 60 to 85 years of age with gradual and progressive change in memory function for 6 months or more, early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels.\nINTERVENTIONS\nDonanemab (an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate β-amyloid epitope) dosing was every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, then 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations occurred at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nChange in amyloid, tau, and clinical decline after donanemab treatment.\nRESULTS\nThe primary study randomized 272 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [5.5] years; 145 female participants [53.3%]). The trial excluded 1683 of 1955 individuals screened. The rate of donanemab-induced amyloid reduction at 24 weeks was moderately correlated with the amount of baseline amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.66 to -0.39; P &lt; .001). Modeling provides a hypothesis that amyloid would not reaccumulate to the 24.1-centiloid threshold for 3.9 years (95% prediction interval, 1.9-8.3 years) after discontinuing donanemab treatment. Donanemab slowed tau accumulation in a region-dependent manner as measured using neocortical and regional standardized uptake value ratios with cerebellar gray reference region. A disease-progression model found a significant association between percentage amyloid reduction and change on the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale only in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (95% CI, 24%-59%; P &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResults of post hoc analyses for donanemab-treated participants suggest that baseline amyloid levels were directly associated with the magnitude of amyloid reduction and inversely associated with the probability of achieving complete amyloid clearance. The donanemab-induced slowing of tau was more pronounced in those with complete amyloid clearance and in brain regions identified later in the pathologic sequence. Data from other trials will be important to confirm aforementioned observations, particularly treatment response by APOE ε4 status.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03367403.", "year": "2022", "venue": "JAMA neurology"}, {"paperId": "36251300", "title": "Association of Donanemab Treatment With Exploratory Plasma Biomarkers in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Randomized Clinical Trial.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nPlasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease may be useful as minimally invasive pharmacodynamic measures of treatment outcomes.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo analyze the association of donanemab treatment with plasma biomarkers associated with Alzheimer disease.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020, across 56 sites in the US and Canada.

Heart failure\nAbstract: Sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization and improve symptoms among patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction compared to enalapril, the gold standard angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In the 5 years since the publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF, further insight has been gained into integrating a neprilysin inhibitor into a comprehensive multidrug regimen, including a renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAS) blocker. This paper reviews the current understanding of the effects of sacubitril/valsartan and highlights expected developments over the next 5 years, including potential new indications for use. Additionally, a practical, evidence-based approach is provided to the clinical integration of sacubitril/valsartan among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31997538\">Title: Highlights in heart failure.\nAuthors: Tomasoni, Daniela, Adamo, Marianna, Lombardi, Carlo Mario et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: ESC heart failure\nAbstract: Heart failure (HF) remains a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and poor quality of life. It is an area of active research. This article is aimed to give an update on recent advances in all aspects of this syndrome. Major changes occurred in drug treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated as a substitute to ACEi/ARBs after PARADIGM-HF (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87 for sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril for the primary endpoint and Wei, Lin and Weissfeld HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.89 for recurrent events). Its initiation was then shown as safe and potentially useful in recent studies in patients hospitalized for acute HF. More recently, dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse-outcomes in DAPA-HF trial showed the beneficial effects of the sodium-glucose transporter type 2 inhibitor dapaglifozin vs. placebo, added to optimal standard therapy [HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85;0.74; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85 for the primary endpoint]. Trials with other SGLT 2 inhibitors and in other patients, such as those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or with recent decompensation, are ongoing. Multiple studies showed the unfavourable prognostic significance of abnormalities in serum potassium levels. Potassium lowering agents may allow initiation and titration of mineralocorticoid antagonists in a larger proportion of patients. Meta-analyses suggest better outcomes with ferric carboxymaltose in patients with iron deficiency. Drugs effective in HFrEF may be useful also in HF with mid-range ejection fraction. Better diagnosis and phenotype characterization seem warranted in HF with preserved ejection fraction.

In previous studies, enalapril improved survival in such patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 8442 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial was designed to detect a difference in the rates of death from cardiovascular causes.\nRESULTS\nThe trial was stopped early, according to prespecified rules, after a median follow-up of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed. At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P<0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3%) and 693 (16.5%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21% (P<0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P=0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart failure.

Diabetes & endocrinology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nDiabetes is an independent risk factor for heart failure progression. Sacubitril/valsartan, a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, improves morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in obese hypertensive patients. We aimed to investigate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril on HbA 1c and time to first-time initiation of insulin or oral antihyperglycaemic drugs in patients with diabetes and HFrEF.\nMETHODS\nIn a post-hoc analysis of the PARADIGM-HF trial, we included 3778 patients with known diabetes or an HbA 1c ≥6·5% at screening out of 8399 patients with HFrEF who were randomly assigned to treatment with sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril. Of these patients, most (98%) had type 2 diabetes. We assessed changes in HbA 1c , triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and BMI in a mixed effects longitudinal analysis model. Time to initiation of oral antihyperglycaemic drugs or insulin in subjects previously not treated with these agents were compared between treatment groups.\nFINDINGS\nThere were no significant differences in HbA 1c concentrations between randomised groups at screening. During the first year of follow-up, HbA 1c concentrations decreased by 0·16% (SD 1·40) in the enalapril group and 0·26% (SD 1·25) in the sacubitril/valsartan group (between-group reduction 0·13%, 95% CI 0·05-0·22, p=0·0023). HbA 1c concentrations were persistently lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group over the 3-year follow-up (between-group reduction 0·14%, 95% CI 0·06-0·23, p=0·0055). New use of insulin was 29% lower in patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan (114 [7%] patients) compared with patients receiving enalapril (153 [10%]; hazard ratio 0·71, 95% CI 0·56-0·90, p=0·0052). Similarly, fewer patients were started on oral antihyperglycaemic therapy (0·77, 0·58-1·02, p=0·073) in the sacubitril/valsartan group.\nINTERPRETATION\nPatients with diabetes and HFrEF enrolled in PARADIGM-HF who received sacubitril/valsartan had a greater long-term reduction in HbA 1c than those receiving enalapril. These data suggest that sacubitril/valsartan might enhance glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and HFrEF.\nFUNDING\nNovartis.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27283779\">Title: Efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril at lower than target doses in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the PARADIGM-HF trial.\nAuthors: Vardeny, Orly, Claggett, Brian, Packer, Milton et al. | Year: 2016 | Journal: European journal of heart failure\nAbstract: AIMS\nIn this analysis, we utilized data from PARADIGM-HF to test the hypothesis that participants who exhibited any dose reduction during the trial would have similar benefits from lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan relative to lower doses of enalapril.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nIn a post-hoc analysis from PARADIGM-HF, we characterized patients by whether they received the maximal dose (200 mg sacubitril/valsartan or 10 mg enalapril twice daily) throughout the trial or had any dose reduction to lower doses (100/50/0 mg sacubitril/valsartan or 5/2.5/0 mg enalapril twice daily). The treatment effect for the primary outcome was estimated, stratified by dose level using time-updated Cox regression models. In the two treatment arms, participants with a dose reduction (43% of those randomized to enalapril and 42% of those randomized to sacubitril/valsartan) had similar baseline characteristics and similar baseline predictors of the need for dose reduction. In a time-updated analysis, any dose reduction was associated with a higher subsequent risk of the primary event [hazard ratio (HR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-2.7]. However, the treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.93, P < 0.001) to that observed in patients who had not experienced any dose reduction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88, P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn PARADIGM-HF, study medication dose reduction identified patients at higher risk of a major cardiovascular event. The magnitude of benefit for patients on lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan relative to those on lower doses of enalapril was similar to that of patients who remained on target doses of both drugs.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\nIn PARADIGM-HF, the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure) occurred in **21.8%** of patients assigned to sacubitril/valsartan versus **26.5%** assigned to enalapril. <cite id=\"25176015\">McMurray et al., NEJM 2014 (PARADIGM-HF): primary outcome 21.8% with LCZ696 vs 26.5% with enalapril.</cite>\n\n- **Absolute risk reduction (ARR):** 26.5% − 21.8% = **4.7%** (0.047) <cite id=\"25176015\">Event rates for the primary composite outcome reported as 21.8% vs 26.5%.</cite>  \n- **Number needed to treat (NNT):** 1 / 0.047 = **21.3**, conventionally rounded up to **22** patients treated (over the trial’s median follow-up of 27 months) to prevent 1 primary composite event. <cite id=\"25176015\">Median follow-up and event rates provided in the trial report.</cite>\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "PARADIGM-HF sacubitril enalapril 25176015", "result": {"total": 171, "data": [{"paperId": "33004114", "title": "Sacubitril/Valsartan: Neprilysin Inhibition 5 Years After PARADIGM-HF.", "abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization and improve symptoms among patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction compared to enalapril, the gold standard angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P<0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3%) and 693 (16.5%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21% (P<0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P=0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart failure.

Sacubitril/valsartan, a combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, improves morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in obese hypertensive patients. We aimed to investigate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril on HbA 1c and time to first-time initiation of insulin or oral antihyperglycaemic drugs in patients with diabetes and HFrEF.\nMETHODS\nIn a post-hoc analysis of the PARADIGM-HF trial, we included 3778 patients with known diabetes or an HbA 1c ≥6·5% at screening out of 8399 patients with HFrEF who were randomly assigned to treatment with sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril. Of these patients, most (98%) had type 2 diabetes. We assessed changes in HbA 1c , triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and BMI in a mixed effects longitudinal analysis model. Time to initiation of oral antihyperglycaemic drugs or insulin in subjects previously not treated with these agents were compared between treatment groups.\nFINDINGS\nThere were no significant differences in HbA 1c concentrations between randomised groups at screening. During the first year of follow-up, HbA 1c concentrations decreased by 0·16% (SD 1·40) in the enalapril group and 0·26% (SD 1·25) in the sacubitril/valsartan group (between-group reduction 0·13%, 95% CI 0·05-0·22, p=0·0023). HbA 1c concentrations were persistently lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group over the 3-year follow-up (between-group reduction 0·14%, 95% CI 0·06-0·23, p=0·0055). New use of insulin was 29% lower in patients receiving sacubitril/valsartan (114 [7%] patients) compared with patients receiving enalapril (153 [10%]; hazard ratio 0·71, 95% CI 0·56-0·90, p=0·0052). Similarly, fewer patients were started on oral antihyperglycaemic therapy (0·77, 0·58-1·02, p=0·073) in the sacubitril/valsartan group.\nINTERPRETATION\nPatients with diabetes and HFrEF enrolled in PARADIGM-HF who received sacubitril/valsartan had a greater long-term reduction in HbA 1c than those receiving enalapril. These data suggest that sacubitril/valsartan might enhance glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and HFrEF.\nFUNDING\nNovartis.", "year": "2017", "venue": "The lancet.

The treatment effect for the primary outcome was estimated, stratified by dose level using time-updated Cox regression models. In the two treatment arms, participants with a dose reduction (43% of those randomized to enalapril and 42% of those randomized to sacubitril/valsartan) had similar baseline characteristics and similar baseline predictors of the need for dose reduction. In a time-updated analysis, any dose reduction was associated with a higher subsequent risk of the primary event [hazard ratio (HR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-2.7]. However, the treatment benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril following a dose reduction was similar (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.93, P < 0.001) to that observed in patients who had not experienced any dose reduction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88, P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn PARADIGM-HF, study medication dose reduction identified patients at higher risk of a major cardiovascular event. The magnitude of benefit for patients on lower doses of sacubitril/valsartan relative to those on lower doses of enalapril was similar to that of patients who remained on target doses of both drugs.",

We found that primary resistance to ICIs can be attributed to abnormal gut microbiome composition. Antibiotics inhibited the clinical benefit of ICIs in patients with advanced cancer. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from cancer patients who responded to ICIs into germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice ameliorated the antitumor effects of PD-1 blockade, whereas FMT from nonresponding patients failed to do so. Metagenomics of patient stool samples at diagnosis revealed correlations between clinical responses to ICIs and the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila Oral supplementation with A. muciniphila after FMT with nonresponder feces restored the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an interleukin-12-dependent manner by increasing the recruitment of CCR9 + CXCR3 + CD4 + T lymphocytes into mouse tumor beds.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37289890\">Title: A microbiota-modulated checkpoint directs immunosuppressive intestinal T cells into cancers.\nAuthors: Fidelle, Marine, Rauber, Conrad, Alves Costa Silva, Carolina et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)\nAbstract: Antibiotics (ABX) compromise the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in cancer patients, but the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive effects remain unknown. By inducing the down-regulation of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) in the ileum, post-ABX gut recolonization by Enterocloster species drove the emigration of enterotropic α4β7 + CD4 + regulatory T 17 cells into the tumor. These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, α4β7 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression. In independent lung, kidney, and bladder cancer patient cohorts, low serum levels of soluble MAdCAM-1 had a negative prognostic impact. Thus, the MAdCAM-1-α4β7 axis constitutes an actionable gut immune checkpoint in cancer immunosurveillance.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35115705\">Title: Intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila predicts clinical response to PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.\nAuthors: Derosa, Lisa, Routy, Bertrand, Thomas, Andrew Maltez et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature medicine\nAbstract: Aside from PD-L1 expression, biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed. In a previous retrospective analysis, we documented that fecal Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) was associated with clinical benefit of ICI in patients with NSCLC or kidney cancer. In the current study, we performed shotgun-metagenomics-based microbiome profiling in a large cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC (n = 338) treated with first- or second-line ICIs to prospectively validate the predictive value of fecal Akk. Baseline stool Akk was associated with increased objective response rates and overall survival in multivariate analyses, independent of PD-L1 expression, antibiotics, and performance status. Intestinal Akk was accompanied by a richer commensalism, including Eubacterium hallii and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and a more inflamed tumor microenvironment in a subset of patients. However, antibiotic use (20% of cases) coincided with a relative dominance of Akk above 4.8% accompanied with the genus Clostridium, both associated with resistance to ICI. Our study shows significant differences in relative abundance of Akk that may represent potential biomarkers to refine patient stratification in future studies.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32847937\">Title: The Gut Microbiome Associates with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition Outcomes in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.\nAuthors: Hakozaki, Taiki, Richard, Corentin, Elkrief, Arielle et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Cancer immunology research\nAbstract: The gut microbiome (GM) plays an important role in shaping systemic immune responses and influences immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy. Antibiotics worsen clinical outcomes in patients receiving ICI. However, whether GM profiling and baseline antibiotic can be a biomarker of ICI efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. We prospectively collected baseline (pre-ICI) fecal samples and clinical data of 70 Japanese patients suffering from advanced NSCLC and treated them with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as a first-line or treatment-refractory therapy. We performed 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing of gene amplicons of fecal samples, and bacteria diversity and differential abundance analysis was performed. The clinical endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immune-related adverse events (irAE). ORR was 34%, and median PFS and OS were 5.2 and 16.2 months, respectively. Patients who received pre-ICI antibiotic had lower alpha diversity at baseline and underrepresentation of Ruminococcaceae UCG 13 and Agathobacter When analyzing antibiotic-free patients, alpha diversity correlated with OS. In addition, Ruminococcaceae UCG 13 and Agathobacter were enriched in patients with favorable ORR and PFS >6 months. Ruminococcaceae UCG 13 was enriched in patients with OS >12 months. GM differences were observed between patients who experienced low- versus high-grade irAE.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a single preoperative high dose of intravenous dexamethasone on the inflammatory response and recovery after emergency laparotomy.\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, patients were prospectively stratified according to surgical pathology (intestinal obstruction and perforated viscus) and randomized to preoperative 1 mg/kg dexamethasone or placebo at a ratio of 1 : 1. The primary outcome was C-reactive protein on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes were postoperative recovery, morbidity, and mortality.\nRESULTS\nA total of 120 patients were included in the trial. On postoperative day 1, the C-reactive protein response was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (a median of 170 versus 220 mg/l for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; P = 0.015; mean difference = 49 (95% c.i. 13 to 85) mg/l) and when stratified according to intestinal obstruction (a median of 60 versus 160 mg/l for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; P = 0.002) and perforated viscus (a median of 230 versus 285 mg/l for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; P = 0.035). Dexamethasone administration was associated with improved recovery (better haemodynamics, better pulmonary function, less fatigue, and earlier mobilization). Furthermore, the dexamethasone group had a lower 90-day mortality rate (7% versus 23% for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; relative risk 0.33 (95% c.i. 0.11 to 0.93); P = 0.023) and a decreased incidence of postoperative major complications (27% versus 45% for dexamethasone and for placebo respectively; relative risk 0.62 (95% c.i. 0.37 to 1.00); P = 0.032).\nCONCLUSION\nA single preoperative high dose of intravenous dexamethasone significantly reduces the inflammatory response after emergency laparotomy and is associated with enhanced recovery and improved outcome.\nREGISTRATION NUMBER\nNCT04791566 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36368193\">Title: Short-time recovery skeletal muscle from dexamethasone-induced atrophy and weakness in old female rats.\nAuthors: Alev, Karin, Aru, Maire, Vain, Arved et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nSeveral pathological conditions (atrophy, dystrophy, spasticity, inflammation) can change muscle biomechanical parameters. Our previous works have shown that dexamethasone treatment changes skeletal muscle tone, stiffness, elasticity. Exercise training may oppose the side effects observed during dexamethasone treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in biomechanical parameters (tone, stiffness, elasticity) of skeletal muscle occurring during dexamethasone treatment and subsequent short-time recovery from glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and weakness, as well as the effect of mild therapeutic exercise.\nMETHODS\n17 old female rats, aged 22 months were used in this study. The hand-held and non-invasive device (MyotonPRO, Myoton Ltd., Tallinn, Estonia) was used to study changes in biomechanical properties of muscle. Additionally, body and muscle mass, hind limb grip strength were assessed.\nFINDINGS\nResults showed that dexamethasone treatment alters muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity. During 20-day recovery period all measured parameters gradually improved towards the average baseline, however, remaining significantly lower than these values. The body and muscle mass, hind limb grip strength of the rats decreased considerably in the groups that received glucocorticoids. After 20 days of recovery, hind limb grip strength of the animals was slightly lower than the baseline value and mild therapeutic exercise had a slight but not significant effect on hind limb grip strength. Biomechanical parameters improved during the recovery period, but only dynamic stiffness and decrement retuned to baseline value.\nINTERPRETATION\nThe study results show that monitoring muscle biomechanical parameters allows to assess the recovery of atrophied muscle from steroid myopathy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36729165\">Title: Dexamethasone administration to improve patient recovery in ambulatory vaginal reconstructive surgery: a randomized prospective trial.\nAuthors: Devakumar, Hemikaa, Ossin, David, Martin, Laura et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: International urogynecology journal\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS\nDexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid that may improve quality of recovery (QoR). We hypothesized that standard administration of dexamethasone at induction may improve QoR compared to placebo in subjects undergoing ambulatory vaginal reconstructive surgeries.\nMETHODS\nThis was a randomized prospective clinical trial on subjects scheduled for ambulatory vaginal reconstructive surgery for prolapse and/or urinary incontinence. Intervention arm subjects were administered dexamethasone and the control group, a placebo (normal saline). Timing of administration, anesthesia medications, postoperative pain medications, and antiemetics were standardized. Primary outcome was difference in QoR (QoR-40) scores 24-48 h after surgery. Power analysis estimated that 27 subjects were required in each group to detect a difference in QoR-40 scores with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.\nRESULTS\nFifty-one subjects were enrolled and randomized. 4 withdrew, 1 was excluded, and 46 were analyzed. For the primary outcome, there was no difference in the QoR-40 between the dexamethasone and placebo group (--13.5 vs -19.6, p=0.24). Postoperative nausea vomiting intensity scores were not different (8.33 vs 9.09, p=1). Pain scores were similar in the two groups (6.0 vs 4.7, p=0.12). Although not statistically significant, surgical satisfaction at 6 weeks was better with dexamethasone (23.5 vs 26.9, p=0.09).\nCONCLUSION\nBased on this study, a single dose of dexamethasone at the time of induction prior to ambulatory vaginal reconstructive surgery was not associated with improved QoR. Standardized anesthesia protocols may play a role in postoperative nausea, pain control, and thereby QoR in patients undergoing ambulatory vaginal reconstructive surgeries.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25839037\">Title: Dexamethasone enhanced functional recovery after sciatic nerve crush injury in rats.\nAuthors: Feng, Xinhong, Yuan, Wei | Year: 2015 | Journal: BioMed research international\nAbstract: Dexamethasone is currently used for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury, but its mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Inflammation/immune response at the site of nerve lesion is known to be an essential trigger of the pathological changes that have a critical impact on nerve repair and regeneration. In this study, we observed the effects of various doses of dexamethasone on the functional recovery after sciatic nerve crush injury in a rat model. Motor functional recovery was monitored by walking track analysis and gastrocnemius muscle mass ratio. The myelinated axon number was counted by morphometric analysis. Rats administered dexamethasone by local intramuscular injection had a higher nerve function index value, increased gastrocnemius muscle mass ratio, reduced Wallerian degeneration severity, and enhanced regenerated myelinated nerve fibers. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for CD3 expression, which is a marker for T-cell activation, and infiltration in the sciatic nerve. Dexamethasone-injected rats had fewer CD3-positive cells compared to controls. Furthermore, we found increased expression of GAP-43, which is a factor associated with development and plasticity of the nervous system, in rat nerves receiving dexamethasone. These results provide strong evidence that dexamethasone enhances sciatic nerve regeneration and function recovery in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury through immunosuppressive and potential neurotrophic effects.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">32678530 dexamethasone covid trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 567 results.

Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\nMETHODS\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the final results of this assessment.\nRESULTS\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.55).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

Drug discovery\nAbstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has stimulated tremendous efforts to develop therapeutic strategies that target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and/or human proteins to control viral infection, encompassing hundreds of potential drugs and thousands of patients in clinical trials. So far, a few small-molecule antiviral drugs (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir and molnupiravir) and 11 monoclonal antibodies have been marketed for the treatment of COVID-19, mostly requiring administration within 10 days of symptom onset. In addition, hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may benefit from treatment with previously approved immunomodulatory drugs, including glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone, cytokine antagonists such as tocilizumab and Janus kinase inhibitors such as baricitinib. Here, we summarize progress with COVID-19 drug discovery, based on accumulated findings since the pandemic began and a comprehensive list of clinical and preclinical inhibitors with anti-coronavirus activities. We also discuss the lessons learned from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases with regard to drug repurposing strategies, pan-coronavirus drug targets, in vitro assays and animal models, and platform trial design for the development of therapeutics to tackle COVID-19, long COVID and pathogenic coronaviruses in future outbreaks.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32876695\">Title: Effect of Dexamethasone on Days Alive and Ventilator-Free in Patients With Moderate or Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and COVID-19: The CoDEX Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Tomazini, Bruno M, Maia, Israel S, Cavalcanti, Alexandre B et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with substantial mortality and use of health care resources. Dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether intravenous dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days among patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nMulticenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in 41 intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil. Patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition, were enrolled from April 17 to June 23, 2020. Final follow-up was completed on July 21, 2020. The trial was stopped early following publication of a related study before reaching the planned sample size of 350 patients.\nINTERVENTIONS\nTwenty mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 5 days, 10 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days or until ICU discharge, plus standard care (n =151) or standard care alone (n = 148).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1, not hospitalized to 6, death), ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater organ dysfunction) at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days.\nRESULTS\nA total of 299 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [14] years; 37% women) were enrolled and all completed follow-up. Patients randomized to the dexamethasone group had a mean 6.6 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 5.0-8.2) during the first 28 days vs 4.0 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 2.9-5.4) in the standard care group (difference, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.2-4.38; P = .04). At 7 days, patients in the dexamethasone group had a mean SOFA score of 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5-6.7) vs 7.5 (95% CI, 6.9-8.1) in the standard care group (difference, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.94 to -0.38; P = .004). There was no significant difference in the prespecified secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days, ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, or the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days. Thirty-three patients (21.9%) in the dexamethasone group vs 43 (29.1%) in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 (31.1%) vs 42 (28.3%) needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 (3.3%) vs 9 (6.1%) experienced other serious adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04327401.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32648899\">Title: Pathophysiology, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review.\nAuthors: Wiersinga, W Joost, Rhodes, Andrew, Cheng, Allen C et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.\nOBSERVATIONS\nSARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAs of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38865154\">Title: Low-Dose Corticosteroids for Critically Ill Adults With Severe Pulmonary Infections: A Review.\nAuthors: Pirracchio, Romain, Venkatesh, Balasubramanian, Legrand, Matthieu | Year: 2024 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nSevere pulmonary infections, including COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, and Pneumocystis pneumonia, are a leading cause of death among adults worldwide. Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients may cause septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or both, which are associated with mortality rates ranging between 30% and 50%.\nOBSERVATIONS\nCorticosteroids mitigate the immune response to infection and improve outcomes for patients with several types of severe pulmonary infections. Low-dose corticosteroids, defined as less than or equal to 400 mg hydrocortisone equivalent daily, can reduce mortality of patients with severe COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. A randomized clinical trial of 6425 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation reported that dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 10 days decreased 28-day mortality (23% vs 26%). A meta-analysis that included 7 randomized clinical trials of 1689 patients treated in the intensive care unit for severe bacterial community-acquired pneumonia reported that hydrocortisone equivalent less than or equal to 400 mg daily for 8 days or fewer was associated with lower 30-day mortality compared with placebo (10% vs 16%). In a meta-analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials, low-dose corticosteroids were associated with lower mortality rates compared with placebo for patients with HIV and moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (13% vs 25%). In a predefined subgroup analysis of a trial of low-dose steroid treatment for septic shock, patients with community-acquired pneumonia randomized to 7 days of intravenous hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours and fludrocortisone 50 μg daily had decreased mortality compared with the placebo group (39% vs 51%). For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by various conditions, low-dose corticosteroids were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (34% vs 45%) according to a meta-analysis of 8 studies that included 1091 patients. Adverse effects of low-dose corticosteroids may include hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, neuropsychiatric disorders, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, and secondary infections.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nTreatment with low-dose corticosteroids is associated with decreased mortality for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (for patients with HIV). Low-dose corticosteroids may also benefit critically ill patients with respiratory infections who have septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or both.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">32876694 WHO REACT corticosteroids</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

The trials were conducted in 12 countries from February 26, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and the date of final follow-up was July 6, 2020. Pooled data were aggregated from the individual trials, overall, and in predefined subgroups. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of overall mortality, with the association between the intervention and mortality quantified using odds ratios (ORs). Random-effects meta-analyses also were conducted (with the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment) and an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect analysis using risk ratios.\nEXPOSURES\nPatients had been randomized to receive systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone (678 patients) or to receive usual care or placebo (1025 patients).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. A secondary outcome was investigator-defined serious adverse events.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1703 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 52-68 years]; 488 [29%] women) were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed as \"low\" for 6 of the 7 mortality results and as \"some concerns\" in 1 trial because of the randomization method. Five trials reported mortality at 28 days, 1 trial at 21 days, and 1 trial at 30 days. There were 222 deaths among the 678 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 425 deaths among the 1025 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.82]; P < .001 based on a fixed-effect meta-analysis). There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 15.6%; P = .31 for heterogeneity) and the summary OR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.48-1.01; P = .053) based on the random-effects meta-analysis. The fixed-effect summary OR for the association with mortality was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.82; P < .001) for dexamethasone compared with usual care or placebo (3 trials, 1282 patients, and 527 deaths), the OR was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.43-1.12; P = .13) for hydrocortisone (3 trials, 374 patients, and 94 deaths), and the OR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.29-2.87; P = .87) for methylprednisolone (1 trial, 47 patients, and 26 deaths). Among the 6 trials that reported serious adverse events, 64 events occurred among 354 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 80 events occurred among 342 patients randomized to usual care or placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nIn this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34228774\">Title: Association Between Administration of IL-6 Antagonists and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Shankar-Hari, Manu, Vale, Claire L, Godolphin, Peter J et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nClinical trials assessing the efficacy of IL-6 antagonists in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have variously reported benefit, no effect, and harm.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes.\nDATA SOURCES\nTrials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts.\nSTUDY SELECTION\nEligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS\nIn this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days.\nRESULTS\nA total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nIn this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nPROSPERO Identifier: CRD42021230155.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"7849810\">Title: Antibiotic drug allergy in children.\nAuthors: Anderson, J A | Year: 1994 | Journal: Current opinion in pediatrics\nAbstract: Cutaneous reactions to penicillin-type antibiotics are usually caused by IgE-mediated reactions directed toward the beta-lactam ring (in penicillin, ampicillin-amoxicillin, and cephalosporins). These allergic reactions may be reliably diagnosed (96% to 99% of the time) with a battery of skin tests derived from penicillin. A few individuals have been identified in Spain, and now Canada, who react to side chains of the beta-lactam antibiotics (and not the beta-lactam ring). Nonallergic cutaneous or systemic reactions to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are now an emerging problem among HIV-infected patients. Life-threatening reactions have been described in HIV-infected infants who were rechallenged with TMP-SMX. New 10-day and 48-hour desensitization procedures have been used successfully in some TMP-SMX-reactive patients. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Lyell's syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis) are the most serious of the antibiotic-associated cutaneous reactions. These reactions may be caused by an immune reaction similar to graft-versus-host syndrome. Corticosteroids have been shown to be helpful in the management of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Although the mortality of toxic epidermal necrolysis is usually high, several children with this disorder have been successfully treated in a burn unit.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33301928\">Title: Corticosteroids in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia who require oxygen: observational comparative study using routine care data.\nAuthors: Tran, Viet-Thi, Mahévas, Matthieu, Bani-Sadr, Firouze et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids on outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation.\nMETHODS\nWe used routine care data from 51 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.8 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (CTC group) versus standard of care (no-CTC group) among adults 18-80 years old with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was intubation or death by day 28. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e. time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 891 patients included in the analysis, 203 were assigned to the CTC group. Use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with risk of intubation or death by day 28 (weighted hazard ratio (wHR) 0.92, 95%CI 0.61-1.39) nor cumulative death rate (wHR 1.03, 95%CI 0.54-1.98). However, use of corticosteroids was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death by day 28 in the prespecified subgroups of patients requiring oxygen ≥3 L/min (wHR 0.50, 95%CI 0.30-0.85) or C-reactive protein level ≥100 mg/L (wHR 0.44, 95%CI 0.23-0.85). The number of hyperglycaemia events was higher for patients with corticosteroids than for those without, but the number of infections was similar.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found no association between the use of corticosteroids and intubation or death in the broad population of patients 18-80 years old, with COVID-19, hospitalized in settings non intensive care units. However, the treatment was associated with a reduced risk of intubation or death for patients with ≥3 L/min oxygen or C-reactive protein level ≥100 mg/L at baseline.

Thirty-three patients (21.9%) in the dexamethasone group vs 43 (29.1%) in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 (31.1%) vs 42 (28.3%) needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 (3.3%) vs 9 (6.1%) experienced other serious adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04327401.", "year": "2020", "venue": "JAMA"}, {"paperId": "32648899", "title": "Pathophysiology, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.\nOBSERVATIONS\nSARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAs of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.", "year": "2020", "venue": "JAMA"}, {"paperId": "38865154", "title": "Low-Dose Corticosteroids for Critically Ill Adults With Severe Pulmonary Infections: A Review.", "abstract": "IMPORTANCE\nSevere pulmonary infections, including COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, and Pneumocystis pneumonia, are a leading cause of death among adults worldwide. Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients may cause septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or both, which are associated with mortality rates ranging between 30% and 50%.\nOBSERVATIONS\nCorticosteroids mitigate the immune response to infection and improve outcomes for patients with several types of severe pulmonary infections. Low-dose corticosteroids, defined as less than or equal to 400 mg hydrocortisone equivalent daily, can reduce mortality of patients with severe COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. A randomized clinical trial of 6425 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation reported that dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 10 days decreased 28-day mortality (23% vs 26%). A meta-analysis that included 7 randomized clinical trials of 1689 patients treated in the intensive care unit for severe bacterial community-acquired pneumonia reported that hydrocortisone equivalent less than or equal to 400 mg daily for 8 days or fewer was associated with lower 30-day mortality compared with placebo (10% vs 16%). In a meta-analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials, low-dose corticosteroids were associated with lower mortality rates compared with placebo for patients with HIV and moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (13% vs 25%). In a predefined subgroup analysis of a trial of low-dose steroid treatment for septic shock, patients with community-acquired pneumonia randomized to 7 days of intravenous hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours and fludrocortisone 50 μg daily had decreased mortality compared with the placebo group (39% vs 51%). For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by various conditions, low-dose corticosteroids were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (34% vs 45%) according to a meta-analysis of 8 studies that included 1091 patients. Adverse effects of low-dose corticosteroids may include hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, neuropsychiatric disorders, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, and secondary infections.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nTreatment with low-dose corticosteroids is associated with decreased mortality for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia (for patients with HIV).

Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of overall mortality, with the association between the intervention and mortality quantified using odds ratios (ORs). Random-effects meta-analyses also were conducted (with the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment) and an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect analysis using risk ratios.\nEXPOSURES\nPatients had been randomized to receive systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone (678 patients) or to receive usual care or placebo (1025 patients).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. A secondary outcome was investigator-defined serious adverse events.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1703 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 52-68 years]; 488 [29%] women) were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed as \"low\" for 6 of the 7 mortality results and as \"some concerns\" in 1 trial because of the randomization method. Five trials reported mortality at 28 days, 1 trial at 21 days, and 1 trial at 30 days.

Associations between ELF with baseline and end of trial (EOT) fibrosis stages and other histologic features were assessed using χ 2 tests and logistic regression models.\nRESULTS\nELF was significantly associated with severity of fibrosis at baseline and EOT. ELF areas under the curve for discriminating patients with clinically significant and advanced fibrosis were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-0.89), respectively. A 1-unit decrease in ELF at EOT was associated with overall histologic improvement (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14; P = .02), resolution of steatohepatitis (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.09-3.25; P = .02), improvement in steatosis grade (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.82; P = .03), and hepatocellular ballooning (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.06-3.00; P = .03), but not with improvement in fibrosis stage (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.78-2.03; P = .34).\nCONCLUSIONS\nELF was associated with fibrosis stage in children who participated in TONIC. Although not associated with improvement in fibrosis, a decrease in ELF at EOT was associated with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis resolution and improvement in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease histology. ELF may be a useful noninvasive test to monitor treatment response in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"21521847\">Title: Effect of vitamin E or metformin for treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children and adolescents: the TONIC randomized controlled trial.\nAuthors: Lavine, Joel E, Schwimmer, Jeffrey B, Van Natta, Mark L et al. | Year: 2011 | Journal: JAMA\nAbstract: CONTEXT\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in US children and adolescents and can present with advanced fibrosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

We evaluated the association of ELF and PIIINP with fibrosis stages at baseline and end of treatment (EOT) with vitamin E or pioglitazone in the PIVENS trial (Pioglitazone vs. Vitamin E vs. Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients With NASH) and characterized ELF and PIIINP changes and their associations with changes in the histological endpoints. ELF and PIIINP were measured at baseline and weeks 16, 48, and 96 on sera from 243 PIVENS participants. Baseline and EOT ELF were significantly associated with fibrosis stage ( P < 0.001). The area under the curve for ELF's detection of clinically significant and advanced fibrosis in baseline biopsies was 0.74 and 0.79, respectively ( P < 0.001). There was a significant drop in ELF score at weeks 48 and 96 in patients who achieved the NAFLD activity score (NAS)-based primary end point ( P = 0.007) but not in those who experienced NASH resolution ( P = 0.24) or fibrosis improvement ( P = 0.50). Change in PIIINP was significantly associated with NASH resolution and improvement in NAS-based histological endpoint and fibrosis ( P < 0.05 for all). Over the study period, both ELF and PIIINP significantly decreased with vitamin E ( P < 0.05), but only PIIINP decreased with pioglitazone ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: ELF is significantly associated with clinically significant and advanced fibrosis in patients with NASH, but its longitudinal changes were not associated with improvement in fibrosis or NASH resolution. PIIINP, one of its components, appears promising for identifying longitudinal histologic changes in patients with NASH and is worthy of further investigation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"18804555\">Title: Pioglitazone versus vitamin E versus placebo for the treatment of non-diabetic patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: PIVENS trial design.\nAuthors: Chalasani, Naga P, Sanyal, Arun J, Kowdley, Kris V et al. | Year: 2009 | Journal: Contemporary clinical trials\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disease associated with obesity and diabetes.

We conducted a study to examine the changes in adipose tissue insulin resistance (Adipo-IR) during the PIVENS trial and its relationship to histological endpoints. Adipo-IR (fasting nonesterified fatty acids [NEFAs] × fasting insulin) was calculated at baseline and after 16 and 96 weeks of therapy. Compared to placebo, the baseline Adipo-IR was not different in either the vitamin E group (P = 0.34) or the pioglitazone group (P = 0.29). Baseline Adipo-IR was significantly associated with fibrosis score (P = 0.02), but not with other histological features or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS). After 16 weeks, compared to placebo, the pioglitazone group had a significant reduction in Adipo-IR (-15.7 versus -1.91; P = 0.02), but this effect did not persist at 96 weeks (-3.25 versus -4.28; P = 0.31). Compared to placebo, Adipo-IR in the vitamin E group did not change significantly either after 16 weeks (P = 0.70) or after 96 weeks (P = 0.85). Change in Adipo-IR at week 16 was not associated with changes in any histological parameters at week 96, but improvement in Adipo-IR at week 96 was significantly associated with improvement in ballooning (P = 0.03), fibrosis (P = 0.004), and NAS (P = 0.01).\nCONCLUSION\nVitamin E improved liver histology independent of changes in Adipo-IR, and pioglitazone treatment acutely improved Adipo-IR, but this was not sustained.

We aimed to determine whether FIB-4 can effectively screen and monitor changes in steatohepatitis (MASH).\nMETHODS\nData were retrieved from the NIDDK-CR R4R central repository, of the CRN/PIVENS (pioglitazone vs vitamin E vs placebo) trial of adult patients without diabetes mellitus and with MASLD.\nRESULTS\n220 patients with MASLD had alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and platelet count, to calculate FIB-4, and repeat liver biopsies for histological MASLD activity scores (NAS). Compared to NAS score of 2, Fib-4 was higher at NAS 5) (p = 0.03), and NAS score of 6 (p = 0.02). FIB-4 correlated with cellular ballooning (r = 0.309, p < 0.001). Levels of ALT (ANOVA, p = 0.016) and AST (ANOVA p = 0.0008) were associated with NAS. NAS improved with pioglitazone by 39 %, p < 0.001 and with vitamin E by 36 %, p < 0.001. Pioglitazone and vitamin E both improved histological sub-scores for steatosis, and inflammation, without statistical changes in fibrosis grade. Changes in FIB-4 correlated with changes in NAS (r = 0.237, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this post hoc analysis, changes in FIB-4 were associated with changes of steatohepatitis. Medication known to treat steatohepatitis, may be considered, before the onset of advanced fibrosis.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30549292\">Title: Improvements in Histologic Features and Diagnosis Associated With Improvement in Fibrosis in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Results From the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network Treatment Trials.\nAuthors: Brunt, Elizabeth M, Kleiner, David E, Wilson, Laura A et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)\nAbstract: Hepatocellular injury and inflammation are believed to be the primary drivers of fibrogenesis that ultimately lead to cirrhosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study sought associations between observed improvements in fibrosis with improvement in specific histologic features, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) ≥2, diagnostic category, and primary histologically based outcomes of two adult NASH treatment trials. The primary outcome for the study was fibrosis improvement from baseline to end of treatment, defined as a 1-point or more improvement in fibrosis stage. This is a retrospective analysis of biopsy data collected from the NASH Clinical Research Network Pathology Committee of Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with NASH Trial (PIVENS) and Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment Trial (FLINT) baseline and final biopsies. Treatment group-adjusted univariable and multivariable logistic regression models related improvement in fibrosis to improvements in other histologic variables, resolution of steatohepatitis, and improvement in the NAS ≥2. In PIVENS 221 subjects had baseline and 96-week biopsies, and in FLINT 200 subjects had baseline and 72-week biopsies. Improvement in fibrosis was found in 38% of PIVENS and 29% of FLINT biopsies; fibrosis improvement was more likely in treated than placebo subjects in both studies. Controlling for treatment group, fibrosis improvement was associated most strongly with resolution of NASH (PIVENS, odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-7.6; P < 0.001; FLINT, OR, 8.0; 95% CI 3.1-20.9; P < 0.001), and improved NAS by ≥2 (PIVENS, OR, 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.3; P = 0.003; FLINT, OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.3; P < 0.001). Improvement in histologic features associated with improved fibrosis for both studies included steatosis, ballooning, Mallory-Denk bodies, and portal, but not lobular, inflammation. Conclusion: These findings support a strong link between histologic resolution of steatohepatitis with improvement in fibrosis in NASH.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">20427778 PIVENS vitamin E pioglitazone</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 13 results.

The aim of this review is to discuss the role of oxidative stress in NASH and biological activities of vitamin E and present available evidence on the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin E in NASH.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nIn Pioglitazone versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (PIVENS) trial, vitamin E therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and resolution of steatohepatitis in adult patients with aggressive NASH, who do not have diabetes or cirrhosis. Although vitamin E showed a significant resolution of NASH in children, a sustained reduction of alanine aminotransferase was not attained in The Treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Children (TONIC) trial.\nSUMMARY\nThe prevalence of NAFLD is likely to increase over time due to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Presently, there is no definitive treatment for NAFLD. Based on available evidence, vitamin E (RRR-α-tocopherol) is only recommended in NASH adults without diabetes or cirrhosis and with aggressive histology. Validation is needed in children before its use can be recommended. Longer follow-up of randomized controlled trials are needed to assess long-term vitamin E safety.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38788522\">Title: FIB-4 as a screening and disease monitoring method in pre-fibrotic stages of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD).\nAuthors: Albert, Stewart G, Wood, Emily M | Year: 2024 | Journal: Journal of diabetes and its complications\nAbstract: AIMS\nGuidelines emphasize screening high-risk patients for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) with a calculated FIB-4 score for therapy to reverse fibrosis. We aimed to determine whether FIB-4 can effectively screen and monitor changes in steatohepatitis (MASH).\nMETHODS\nData were retrieved from the NIDDK-CR R4R central repository, of the CRN/PIVENS (pioglitazone vs vitamin E vs placebo) trial of adult patients without diabetes mellitus and with MASLD.\nRESULTS\n220 patients with MASLD had alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and platelet count, to calculate FIB-4, and repeat liver biopsies for histological MASLD activity scores (NAS). Compared to NAS score of 2, Fib-4 was higher at NAS 5) (p = 0.03), and NAS score of 6 (p = 0.02). FIB-4 correlated with cellular ballooning (r = 0.309, p < 0.001). Levels of ALT (ANOVA, p = 0.016) and AST (ANOVA p = 0.0008) were associated with NAS. NAS improved with pioglitazone by 39 %, p < 0.001 and with vitamin E by 36 %, p < 0.001. Pioglitazone and vitamin E both improved histological sub-scores for steatosis, and inflammation, without statistical changes in fibrosis grade. Changes in FIB-4 correlated with changes in NAS (r = 0.237, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this post hoc analysis, changes in FIB-4 were associated with changes of steatohepatitis. Medication known to treat steatohepatitis, may be considered, before the onset of advanced fibrosis.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n### Pediatric NAFLD (TONIC) vs adult NASH (PIVENS): histologic and biochemical", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21521847/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21521847/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Effect of vitamin E or metformin for treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children and adolescents: the TONIC randomized controlled trial \\nJAMA. 2011 Apr 27;305(16):1659-68. doi: 10.1001/jama.2011.520. \\n###  Authors \\nJoel E Lavine 1 , Jeffrey B Schwimmer, Mark L Van Natta, Jean P Molleston, Karen F Murray, Philip Rosenthal, Stephanie H Abrams, Ann O Scheimann, Arun J Sanyal, Naga Chalasani, James Tonascia, Aynur Ünalp, Jeanne M Clark, Elizabeth M Brunt, David E Kleiner, Jay H Hoofnagle, Patricia R Robuck; Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network\\n###  Collaborators \\n  * **Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network** : \\nJoel E Lavine, Arun J Sanyal, Stephanie H Abrams, Nathan M Bass, Naga Chalasani, Anna Mae Diehl, Kris V Kowdley, Rohit Loomba, Arthur J McCullough, Jean P Molleston, Karen F Murray, Patricia R Robuck, Philip Rosenthal, Brent A Neuschwander-Tetri, James Tonascia, Joel E Lavine, Jeffrey B Schwimmer, Aynur Ünalp, Arthur J McCullough, Margaret Stager, Srinivasan Dasarathy, Carol Hawkins, Yao-Chang Liu, Ruth Sargent, Judy Whitwell, Anna Mae Diehl, Manal F Abdelmalek, Cynthia Guy, Dawn Piercy, Melissa Smith, Yi-Ping Pan, Ann O Scheimann, Michael Torbenson, Kimberly Pfeifer, Naga Chalasani, Jean P Molleston, Oscar W Cummings, Ann Klipsch, Linda Ragozzino, Girish Subbarao, Raj Vuppalanchi, Brent A Neuschwander-Tetri, Jose Derdoy, Elizabeth M Brunt, Sarah Barlow, Susan Stewart, Joan Siegner, Joyce A Hoffmann, Judy Thompson, Stephanie H Abrams, Leanel A Fairly, Joel E Lavine, Jeffrey B Schwimmer, Cynthia Behling, Janis Durelle, Steven Rose, Tanya Stein, Nathan M Bass, Philip Rosenthal, Linda D Ferrell, Raphael Merriman, Mark Pabst, Danuta Filipowski, Arun J Sanyal, Daphne Bryan, Melissa J Contos, Velimir A C Luketic, Michael Fuchs, Bimalijit Sandhu, Carol Sargeant, Sherry Boyett, Melanie White, Amy Jones, Parvathi Mohan, Kavita Nair, Kris V Kowdley, James Nelson, Sarah Ackermann, Cheryl Shaw, Karen F Murray, Matthew Yeh, Melissa Young, David E Kleiner, Edward C Doo, Jay H Hoofnagle, Patricia R Robuck, Terry T-K Huang, James Tonascia, Patricia Belt, Jeanne M Clark, Ryan Colvin, Michele Donithan, Mika Green, Milana Isaacson, Wana K Jin, Laura A Miriel, Alice Sternberg, Aynur Ünalp, Mark L Van Natta, Ivana Vaughn, Laura A Wilson, Katherine P Yates, Timothy Morgan, Maureen Jonas, Elizabeth Rand, John Buse, David M Reboussin, William Lee\\n\\n\\n###  Affiliation \\n  * 1 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. jl3553@columbia.edu\\n\\n\\n  * PMID:  21521847 \\n  * PMCID:  PMC3110082 \\n  * DOI:  10.1001/jama.2011.520 \\n\\n\\n##  Abstract \\n**Context:** Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in US children and adolescents and can present with advanced fibrosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis "}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:38:25.721877"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "TONIC pediatric NAFLD vitamin E metformin", "result": {"total": 3, "data": [{"paperId": "34400208", "title": "Relationship of Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Score with Pediatric Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Histology and Response to Vitamin E or Metformin.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo study the diagnostic performance of the enhanced liver fibrosis score (ELF) for detecting different stages of fibrosis and its usefulness in detecting histologic response to vitamin E or metformin in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who participated in the Vitamin E or Metformin for the Treatment Of NAFLD In Children (TONIC) trial.\nSTUDY DESIGN\nELF was measured at baseline and weeks 24, 48, and 96 on sera from 166 TONIC participants.

NASH is a progressive disorder that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress are thought to play important roles in its pathogenesis. There is no definitive treatment for NASH.\nOBJECTIVES\nPIVENS is conducted to test the hypotheses that treatment with pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizer, or vitamin E, a naturally available antioxidant, will lead to improvement in hepatic histology in non-diabetic adults with biopsy proven NASH.\nDESIGN\nPIVENS is a randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with pioglitazone or vitamin E improves hepatic histology in non-diabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo. Before and post-treatment liver biopsies are read centrally in a masked fashion for an assessment of steatohepatitis and a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) consisting of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning. The primary outcome measure is defined as either an improvement in NAS by 2 or more in at least two NAS features, or a post-treatment NAS of 3 or less, and improvement in hepatocyte ballooning by 1 or more, and no worsening of fibrosis.\nMETHODS\nPIVENS enrollment started in January 2005 and ended in January 2007 with 247 patients randomized to receive either pioglitazone (30 mg q.d.), vitamin E (800 IU q.d.), or placebo for 96 weeks. Participants will be followed for an additional 24 weeks after stopping the treatment. The study protocol incorporates the use of several validated questionnaires and specimen banking. This protocol was approved by all participating center Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) which was established for monitoring the accumulated interim data as the trial progresses to ensure patient safety and to review efficacy as well as the quality of data collection and overall study management.

Presently, there is no definitive treatment for NAFLD. Based on available evidence, vitamin E (RRR-α-tocopherol) is only recommended in NASH adults without diabetes or cirrhosis and with aggressive histology.

The primary end point was event-free survival according to blinded central review. Key secondary end points were response and overall survival. Safety was also assessed.\nRESULTS\nA total of 180 patients were randomly assigned to receive axi-cel and 179 to receive standard care. The primary end-point analysis of event-free survival showed that axi-cel therapy was superior to standard care. At a median follow-up of 24.9 months, the median event-free survival was 8.3 months in the axi-cel group and 2.0 months in the standard-care group, and the 24-month event-free survival was 41% and 16%, respectively (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.51; P<0.001). A response occurred in 83% of the patients in the axi-cel group and in 50% of those in the standard-care group (with a complete response in 65% and 32%, respectively). In an interim analysis, the estimated overall survival at 2 years was 61% in the axi-cel group and 52% in the standard-care group. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 91% of the patients who received axi-cel and in 83% of those who received standard care. Among patients who received axi-cel, grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome occurred in 6% and grade 3 or higher neurologic events in 21%. No deaths related to cytokine release syndrome or neurologic events occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAxi-cel therapy led to significant improvements, as compared with standard care, in event-free survival and response, with the expected level of high-grade toxic effects.

PRO instruments were administered at baseline, day 50, day 100, day 150, month 9, and every 3 months from randomization until 24 months or an event-free survival event. The quality of life (QoL) analysis set comprised patients with a baseline and ≥1 follow-up PRO completion. Prespecified hypotheses for Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) physical functioning, global health status/QoL, and EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (VAS) were tested using mixed-effects models with repeated measures. Clinically meaningful changes were defined as 10 points for QLQ-C30 and 7 for EQ-5D-5L VAS. Among 359 patients, 296 (165 axi-cel, 131 SOC) met inclusion criteria for QoL analysis. At day 100, statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in mean change of scores from baseline were observed favoring axi-cel over SOC for QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL (estimated difference 18.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.3-23.9]), physical functioning (13.1 [95% CI, 8.0-18.2]), and EQ-5D-5L VAS (13.7 [95% CI, 8.5-18.8]; P < .0001 for all).

Data were needed on longer-term outcomes.\nMETHODS\nIn this trial, we randomly assigned patients with early relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma in a 1:1 ratio to receive either axi-cel or standard care (two to three cycles of chemoimmunotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients who had a response). The primary outcome was event-free survival, and key secondary outcomes were response and overall survival. Here, we report the results of the prespecified overall survival analysis at 5 years after the first patient underwent randomization.\nRESULTS\nA total of 359 patients underwent randomization to receive axi-cel (180 patients) or standard care (179 patients). At a median follow-up of 47.2 months, death had been reported in 82 patients in the axi-cel group and in 95 patients in the standard-care group. The median overall survival was not reached in the axi-cel group and was 31.1 months in the standard-care group; the estimated 4-year overall survival was 54.6% and 46.0%, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.98; P = 0.03 by stratified two-sided log-rank test). This increased survival with axi-cel was observed in the intention-to-treat population, which included 74% of patients with primary refractory disease and other high-risk features. The median investigator-assessed progression-free survival was 14.7 months in the axi-cel group and 3.7 months in the standard-care group, with estimated 4-year percentages of 41.8% and 24.4%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.67).

Herein, we report pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and product and apheresis attributes associated with outcomes among patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in ZUMA-7. Axi-cel peak expansion associated with clinical response and toxicity, but not response durability. In apheresis material and final product, a naive T-cell phenotype (CCR7+CD45RA+) expressing CD27 and CD28 associated with improved response durability, event-free survival, progression-free survival, and a lower number of prior therapies. This phenotype was not associated with high-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurologic events. Higher baseline and postinfusion levels of serum inflammatory markers associated with differentiated/effector products, reduced efficacy, and increased CRS and neurologic events, thus suggesting targets for intervention.

Adults eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT; N = 184) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to liso-cel (100 × 106 chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells) or SOC (3 cycles of platinum-based immunochemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT in responders). The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS). In this primary analysis with a 17.5-month median follow-up, median EFS was not reached (NR) for liso-cel vs 2.4 months for SOC. Complete response (CR) rate was 74% for liso-cel vs 43% for SOC (P < .0001) and median progression-free survival (PFS) was NR for liso-cel vs 6.2 months for SOC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.400; P < .0001). Median overall survival (OS) was NR for liso-cel vs 29.9 months for SOC (HR = 0.724; P = .0987). When adjusted for crossover from SOC to liso-cel, 18-month OS rates were 73% for liso-cel and 54% for SOC (HR = 0.415).

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas.\nMETHODS\nWe did a seamless design study at 14 cancer centres in the USA. We enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas. Eligible histological subgroups included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC and either BCL2, BCL6, or both (double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformed from any indolent lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B. Patients were assigned to one of three target dose levels of liso-cel as they were sequentially tested in the trial (50 × 10 6 CAR + T cells [one or two doses], 100 × 10 6 CAR + T cells, and 150 × 10 6 CAR + T cells), which were administered as a sequential infusion of two components (CD8 + and CD4 + CAR + T cells) at equal target doses. Primary endpoints were adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, and the objective response rate (assessed per Lugano criteria); endpoints were assessed by an independent review committee in the efficacy-evaluable set (comprising all patients who had confirmed PET-positive disease and received at least one dose of liso-cel). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02631044.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Jan 11, 2016, and July 5, 2019, 344 patients underwent leukapheresis for manufacture of CAR + T cells (liso-cel), of whom 269 patients received at least one dose of liso-cel. Patients had received a median of three (range 1-8) previous lines of systemic treatment, with 260 (97%) patients having had at least two lines. 112 (42%) patients were aged 65 years or older, 181 (67%) had chemotherapy-refractory disease, and seven (3%) had secondary CNS involvement. Median follow-up for overall survival for all 344 patients who had leukapheresis was 18·8 months (95% CI 15·0-19·3). Overall safety and activity of liso-cel did not differ by dose level. The recommended target dose was 100 × 10 6 CAR + T cells (50 × 10 6 CD8 + and 50 × 10 6 CD4 + CAR + T cells). Of 256 patients included in the efficacy-evaluable set, an objective response was achieved by 186 (73%, 95% CI 66·8-78·0) patients and a complete response by 136 (53%, 46·8-59·4). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia in 161 (60%) patients, anaemia in 101 (37%), and thrombocytopenia in 72 (27%). Cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in 113 (42%) and 80 (30%) patients, respectively; grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in six (2%) and 27 (10%) patients, respectively. Nine (6%) patients had a dose-limiting toxicity, including one patient who died from diffuse alveolar damage following a dose of 50 × 10 6 CAR + T cells.\nINTERPRETATION\nUse of liso-cel resulted in a high objective response rate, with a low incidence of grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome and neurological events in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas, including those with diverse histological subtypes and high-risk features. Liso-cel is under further evaluation at first relapse in large B-cell lymphomas and as a treatment for other relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.\nFUNDING\nJuno Therapeutics, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35717989\">Title: Lisocabtagene maraleucel versus standard of care with salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation as second-line treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (TRANSFORM): results from an interim analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.\nAuthors: Kamdar, Manali, Solomon, Scott R, Arnason, Jon et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Lancet (London, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nPatients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) primary refractory to or relapsed within 12 months of first-line therapy are at high risk for poor outcomes with current standard of care, platinum-based salvage immunochemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), an autologous, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has previously demonstrated efficacy and manageable safety in third-line or later LBCL. In this Article, we report a prespecified interim analysis of liso-cel versus standard of care as second-line treatment for primary refractory or early relapsed (within 12 months after response to initial therapy) LBCL.\nMETHODS\nTRANSFORM is a global, phase 3 study, conducted in 47 sites in the USA, Europe, and Japan, comparing liso-cel with standard of care as second-line therapy in patients with primary refractory or early (≤12 months) relapsed LBCL. Adults aged 18-75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 or less, adequate organ function, PET-positive disease per Lugano 2014 criteria, and candidates for autologous HSCT were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of interactive response technology, to liso-cel (100 × 10 6 CAR + T cells intravenously) or standard of care. Standard of care consisted of three cycles of salvage immunochemotherapy delivered intravenously-R-DHAP (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, two infusions of cytarabine 2000 mg/m 2 on day 2, and cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 on day 1), R-ICE (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, ifosfamide 5000 mg/m 2 on day 2, etoposide 100 mg/m 2 on days 1-3, and carboplatin area under the curve 5 [maximum dose of 800 mg] on day 2), or R-GDP (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 on day 1)-followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT in responders. Primary endpoint was event-free survival, with response assessments by an independent review committee per Lugano 2014 criteria. Efficacy was assessed per intention-to-treat (ie, all randomly assigned patients) and safety in patients who received any treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03575351, and is ongoing.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Oct 23, 2018, and Dec 8, 2020, 232 patients were screened and 184 were assigned to the liso-cel (n=92) or standard of care (n=92) groups. At the data cutoff for this interim analysis, March 8, 2021, the median follow-up was 6·2 months (IQR 4·4-11·5). Median event-free survival was significantly improved in the liso-cel group (10·1 months [95% CI 6·1-not reached]) compared with the standard-of-care group (2·3 months [2·2-4·3]; stratified hazard ratio 0·35; 95% CI 0·23-0·53; stratified Cox proportional hazards model one-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (74 [80%] of 92 patients in the liso-cel group vs 46 [51%] of 91 patients in the standard-of-care group), anaemia (45 [49%] vs 45 [49%]), thrombocytopenia (45 [49%] vs 58 [64%]), and prolonged cytopenia (40 [43%] vs three [3%]). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurological events, which are associated with CAR T-cell therapy, occurred in one (1%) and four (4%) of 92 patients in the liso-cel group, respectively (no grade 4 or 5 events). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 44 (48%) patients in the liso-cel group and 44 (48%) in the standard-of-care group. No new liso-cel safety concerns were identified in the second-line setting. There were no treatment-related deaths in the liso-cel group and one treatment-related death due to sepsis in the standard-of-care group.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese results support liso-cel as a new second-line treatment recommendation in patients with early relapsed or refractory LBCL.\nFUNDING\nCelgene, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40623279\">Title: Lisocabtagene Maraleucel Versus Standard of Care for Second-Line Relapsed/Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma: 3-Year Follow-Up From the Randomized, Phase III TRANSFORM Study.\nAuthors: Kamdar, Manali, Solomon, Scott R, Arnason, Jon et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nAbstract: We report 3-year follow-up results from TRANSFORM comparing lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) versus standard of care (SOC) for second-line primary refractory/early relapsed (≤12 months) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Adults eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (N = 184) were randomly assigned 1:1 to liso-cel (100 × 10 6 chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells) or SOC. Results are reported descriptively. With a median follow-up of 33.9 months, median (95% CI) event-free survival was 29.5 months (9.5 to not reached [NR]) for liso-cel versus 2.4 months (2.2 to 4.9) for SOC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.375; 95% CI, 0.259 to 0.542). Median progression-free survival was NR (12.6-NR) for liso-cel versus 6.2 months (4.3-8.6) for SOC (HR, 0.422; 95% CI, 0.279 to 0.639) with 36-month rates of 51% versus 26.5%. Median overall survival (OS) was NR for both arms (HR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.481 to 1.191), with 66% of patients crossing over to receive liso-cel; 36-month OS rate was 63% for liso-cel versus 52% for SOC. OS HR (0.566 [95% CI, 0.359 to 0.895]) favored liso-cel when accounting for the treatment effect of crossover. Safety results were consistent with previous reports. At 3-year follow-up, liso-cel confirmed superior, more durable efficacy versus SOC with a favorable safety profile and no new safety signals.

In relapsed or refractory disease, only about 20% achieve durable remission with salvage chemoimmunotherapy and consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The ZUMA-7 (axicabtagene ciloleucel [axi-cel]) and TRANSFORM (lisocabtagene maraleucel [liso-cel]) trials demonstrated superior event-free survival (and, in ZUMA-7, overall survival) in primary-refractory or early-relapsed (high-risk) DLBCL with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy and consolidative ASCT; however, list prices for CAR-T exceed $400 000 per infusion.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the cost-effectiveness of second-line CAR-T versus salvage chemoimmunotherapy and consolidative ASCT.\nDESIGN\nState-transition microsimulation model.\nDATA SOURCES\nZUMA-7, TRANSFORM, other trials, and observational data.\nTARGET POPULATION\n\"High-risk\" patients with DLBCL.\nTIME HORIZON\nLifetime.\nPERSPECTIVE\nHealth care sector.\nINTERVENTION\nAxi-cel or liso-cel versus ASCT.\nOUTCOME MEASURES\nIncremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) in 2022 U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $200 000 per QALY.\nRESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS\nThe increase in median overall survival was 4 months for axi-cel and 1 month for liso-cel. For axi-cel, the ICER was $684 225 per QALY and the iNMB was -$107 642. For liso-cel, the ICER was $1 171 909 per QALY and the iNMB was -$102 477.\nRESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nTo be cost-effective with a WTP of $200 000, the cost of CAR-T would have to be reduced to $321 123 for axi-cel and $313 730 for liso-cel. Implementation in high-risk patients would increase U.S. health care spending by approximately $6.8 billion over a 5-year period.\nLIMITATION\nDifferences in preinfusion bridging therapies precluded cross-trial comparisons.\nCONCLUSION\nNeither second-line axi-cel nor liso-cel was cost-effective at a WTP of $200 000 per QALY. Clinical outcomes improved incrementally, but costs of CAR-T must be lowered substantially to enable cost-effectiveness.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE\nNo research-specific funding.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n### Event-free survival (EFS): CAR‑T (2nd line) vs standard salvage chemotherapy → ASCT\n\n**ZUMA‑7 (axi-cel vs SOC)**  \n- **Median EFS:** 8.3 months (axi-cel) vs 2.0 months (SOC)  \n- **24-month EFS:** 41% (axi-cel) vs 16% (SOC)  \n- **HR for event/death:** 0.40 (favoring axi-cel) <cite id=\"34891224\">ZUMA-7: axi-cel improved EFS vs standard salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT; median EFS 8.3 vs 2.0 months; 24-month EFS 41% vs 16%; HR 0.40.</cite>\n\n**TRANSFORM (liso-cel vs SOC)**  \n- **Median EFS:** 10.1 months (liso-cel) vs 2.3 months (SOC)  \n- **HR for event/death:** 0.35 (favoring liso-cel) <cite id=\"35717989\">TRANSFORM interim analysis: liso-cel improved EFS vs standard salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT; median EFS 10.1 vs 2.3 months; HR 0.35.</cite>\n\n**Overall:** In both randomized trials, second-line CAR‑T produced substantially longer EFS than standard salvage chemotherapy with intent for ASCT.\n\n---\n\n### Grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (ICANS/neurologic events)\n\n**ZUMA‑7 (axi-cel arm)**  \n- **Grade ≥3 CRS:** 6%  \n- **Grade ≥3 neurologic events:** 21% <cite id=\"34891224\">ZUMA-7 safety: grade ≥3 CRS 6% and grade ≥3 neurologic events 21% with axi-cel.", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891223/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891223/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Betibeglogene Autotemcel Gene Therapy for Non-β0/β0 Genotype β-Thalassemia \\nN Engl J Med. 2022 Feb 3;386(5):415-427. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2113206.

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas.\nMETHODS\nWe did a seamless design study at 14 cancer centres in the USA. We enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas. Eligible histological subgroups included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma with rearrangements of MYC and either BCL2, BCL6, or both (double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma transformed from any indolent lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B. Patients were assigned to one of three target dose levels of liso-cel as they were sequentially tested in the trial (50 × 10 6 CAR + T cells [one or two doses], 100 × 10 6 CAR + T cells, and 150 × 10 6 CAR + T cells), which were administered as a sequential infusion of two components (CD8 + and CD4 + CAR + T cells) at equal target doses. Primary endpoints were adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, and the objective response rate (assessed per Lugano criteria); endpoints were assessed by an independent review committee in the efficacy-evaluable set (comprising all patients who had confirmed PET-positive disease and received at least one dose of liso-cel). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02631044.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Jan 11, 2016, and July 5, 2019, 344 patients underwent leukapheresis for manufacture of CAR + T cells (liso-cel), of whom 269 patients received at least one dose of liso-cel. Patients had received a median of three (range 1-8) previous lines of systemic treatment, with 260 (97%) patients having had at least two lines. 112 (42%) patients were aged 65 years or older, 181 (67%) had chemotherapy-refractory disease, and seven (3%) had secondary CNS involvement. Median follow-up for overall survival for all 344 patients who had leukapheresis was 18·8 months (95% CI 15·0-19·3). Overall safety and activity of liso-cel did not differ by dose level. The recommended target dose was 100 × 10 6 CAR + T cells (50 × 10 6 CD8 + and 50 × 10 6 CD4 + CAR + T cells). Of 256 patients included in the efficacy-evaluable set, an objective response was achieved by 186 (73%, 95% CI 66·8-78·0) patients and a complete response by 136 (53%, 46·8-59·4). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia in 161 (60%) patients, anaemia in 101 (37%), and thrombocytopenia in 72 (27%). Cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in 113 (42%) and 80 (30%) patients, respectively; grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome and neurological events occurred in six (2%) and 27 (10%) patients, respectively.

Adults aged 18-75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1 or less, adequate organ function, PET-positive disease per Lugano 2014 criteria, and candidates for autologous HSCT were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of interactive response technology, to liso-cel (100 × 10 6 CAR + T cells intravenously) or standard of care. Standard of care consisted of three cycles of salvage immunochemotherapy delivered intravenously-R-DHAP (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, two infusions of cytarabine 2000 mg/m 2 on day 2, and cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 on day 1), R-ICE (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, ifosfamide 5000 mg/m 2 on day 2, etoposide 100 mg/m 2 on days 1-3, and carboplatin area under the curve 5 [maximum dose of 800 mg] on day 2), or R-GDP (rituximab 375 mg/m 2 on day 1, dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 on day 1)-followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT in responders.

Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurological events, which are associated with CAR T-cell therapy, occurred in one (1%) and four (4%) of 92 patients in the liso-cel group, respectively (no grade 4 or 5 events). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 44 (48%) patients in the liso-cel group and 44 (48%) in the standard-of-care group. No new liso-cel safety concerns were identified in the second-line setting.

One of the Study 19 inclusion criteria was forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥80% of predicted (≥80%p). Therefore, the study provided no information on edaravone efficacy in subjects with FVC <80%p. In Study 19, 24-week, double-blind treatment was followed by open-label treatment where all subjects received edaravone. At 24 weeks, some subjects had FVC <80%p (FVC24 <80%p). This allowed for post-hoc assessment of the effects of edaravone in subgroups of subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo address the question of the efficacy of edaravone in ALS patients with FVC <80%p.\nMETHODS\nPost-hoc analysis of Study 19 comparing edaravone efficacy at week 48 in subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p.\nRESULTS\nWith edaravone treatment, subjects in both the FVC24 ≥80%p and the FVC24 <80%p subgroups experienced a reduction in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score loss vs placebo subjects through week 48. For the FVC24 ≥80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -7.63 for edaravone-edaravone vs -9.69 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 2.05 (P = .034; 95% CI: 0.16, 3.94). For the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -10.26 for edaravone-edaravone vs -15.20 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 4.94 (P = .0038; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.25).

The 24-week, double-blind period was followed by a 24-week, open-label, active extension period. Patients originally receiving edaravone continued edaravone (E-E group, n = 65), and patients originally receiving placebo switched to edaravone (P-E group, n = 58). Because no statistical tests had been prospectively planned in the open-label period, we performed post-hoc analyses to assist in the interpretation of efficacy data. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) were assessed. Additionally, slopes of time-dependent change between baseline in cycle 1 and the end of cycle 6 (24 weeks double-blind) and between the end of cycle 6 and end of cycle 12 (24 weeks open-label) were calculated using a random coefficient model including all available data during each period. At week 48, the MMRM analysis showed significantly less decline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score in the E-E group than in the P-E group (least-squares mean change from baseline ± standard error, 4.17 ± 1.40, p = 0.0037), meaning that the differences in the ALSFRS-R total score during the 24-week double-blind period were maintained in patients receiving edaravone for an additional 24 weeks. The CAFS endpoint (p = 0.0089) supported this finding. The slope analysis during the double-blind period showed a significant difference between the treatment groups, while there was no significant difference between the groups during the active extension period. These analyses suggest a potential benefit of early and continued edaravone treatment over delayed edaravone treatment.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36054038\">Title: Associations between urate levels and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional score with edaravone treatment: Post hoc analysis of studies MCI186-16, MCI186-17, and MCI186-19.\nAuthors: Takahashi, Fumihiro, Kano, Osamu, Nagano, Yoshito et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Muscle & nerve\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION/AIMS\nEdaravone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was analyzed in two phase 3 studies (MCI186-16 and MCI186-19). Those trials enrolled patients with Japanese ALS severity grades 1 and 2 (less severe ALS), but many patients progressed to grades 3 and 4 during the double-blind treatment period. The placebo patients who initiated edaravone treatment in the open-label periods provided an opportunity to assess the effects of edaravone in more severe ALS. This study also assessed the association between ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) slope and biomarker changes after open-label edaravone initiation.\nMETHODS\nChange in ALSFRS-R slope in placebo patients before and after initiating edaravone treatment was assessed using the random coefficient model. The association of ALSFRS-R change and blood marker changes was explored by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method of machine learning.\nRESULTS\nTwenty-four percent of patients (35/146) in the placebo-edaravone group showed ≥25% slowing of decline in the ALSFRS-R slope. Within the 25% slower-decline group, 60% (21/35) had Japanese ALS severity grades 3 or 4 at the start of edaravone treatment. The LASSO model identified serum urate as associated with the percentage change in ALSFRS-R slope. The rate of decrease in urate was smaller in the 25% slower-decline group than in the non-25% slower-decline group during edaravone treatment.\nDISCUSSION\nThis post hoc analysis indicated that ALS patients, including those with advanced ALS severity grades, may receive benefit in the group of patients whose urate levels are stable during the course of the edaravone treatment.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37219865\">Title: Clenbuterol Treatment Is Safe and Associated With Slowed Disease Progression in a Small Open-Label Trial in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\nAuthors: Li, Xiaoyan, Koeberl, Dwight D, Lutz, Michael W et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Journal of clinical neuromuscular disease\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nClenbuterol, a beta-agonist, has plausible mechanisms for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this highly inclusive open-label trial (NCT04245709), we aimed to study the safety and efficacy of clenbuterol in patients with ALS.\nMETHODS\nAll participants received clenbuterol starting at 40 μg daily and increased to 80 μg twice daily. Outcomes included safety, tolerability, ALS Functional Rating Score (ALSFRS-R) progression, forced vital capacity (FVC) progression, and myometry. ALSFRS-R and FVC slopes measured during treatment were compared with slopes before treatment (calculated by assuming ALSFRS-R was 48 and FVC was 100% at ALS onset).\nRESULTS\nThe 25 participants had a mean age of 59, mean disease duration of 43 months, ALSFRS-R score at enrollment 34, and FVC at enrollment 77%. Forty-eight percent were female, 68% were taking riluzole, and none were taking edaravone. Two participants experienced severe adverse events, neither related to the study. Twenty-four participants experienced adverse events, most commonly tremors/jitters, cramps/spasms, insomnia, and stiffness/spasticity. Fourteen participants withdrew early from the trial, 13 due to adverse events. Patients who withdrew early were significantly older and more likely to be male. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses showed meaningfully slower ALSFRS-R and FVC progression during treatment. Hand grip dynamometry and myometry changes were highly variable between participants; most declined slowly, but some showed improvements.\nCONCLUSIONS\nClenbuterol was safe but less tolerable at the doses we selected compared with an earlier Italian case series. Consistent with that series, our study suggested benefits on ALS progression. However, the latter result should be interpreted with caution as our study is limited by small sample size, large drop out, lack of randomization, and blinding and placebo controls. A larger, more traditional trial now seems warranted.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">edaravone trial 28350746</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 325 results.

The present clinical trial aimed at testing the effects of edaravone dexborneol versus edaravone on 90-day functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).\nMETHODS\nA multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative, phase III clinical trial was conducted at 48 hospitals in China between May 2015 and December 2016. Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed as AIS, 35 to 80 years of age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score between 4 and 24, and within 48 hours of AIS onset. AIS patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment arms: 14-day infusion of edaravone dexborneol or edaravone injection. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale score ≤1 on day 90 after randomization.\nRESULTS\nOne thousand one hundred sixty-five AIS patients were randomly allocated to the edaravone dexborneol group (n=585) or the edaravone group (n=580). The edaravone dexborneol group showed significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing good functional outcomes on day 90 after randomization, compared with the edaravone group (modified Rankin Scale score ≤1, 67.18% versus 58.97%; odds ratio, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.12-1.81]; P =0.004). The prespecified subgroup analyses indicated that a greater benefit was observed in female patients than their male counterparts (2.26, 1.49-3.43 versus 1.14, 0.85-1.52).\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen edaravone dexborneol versus edaravone was administered within 48 hours after AIS, 90-day good functional outcomes favored the edaravone dexborneol group, especially in female patients.

Participants were recruited from 33 centers in China. Patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were aged 18 to 80 years and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score between 6 and 20, a total motor deficit score of the upper and lower limbs of 2 or greater, a clinically diagnosed AIS symptom within 48 hours, and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or less before stroke. Patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria or declined to participate were excluded.\nINTERVENTION\nPatients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive sublingual edaravone dexborneol (edaravone, 30 mg; dexborneol, 6 mg) or placebo (edaravone, 0 mg; dexborneol, 60 μg) twice daily for 14 days and were followed up until 90 days.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with mRS score of 1 or less on day 90 after randomization.\nRESULTS\nOf 956 patients, 42 were excluded. A total of 914 patients (median [IQR] age, 64.0 [56.0-70.0] years; 608 male [66.5%]) were randomly allocated to the edaravone dexborneol group (450 [49.2%]) or placebo group (464 [50.8%]). The edaravone dexborneol group showed a significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing good functional outcomes on day 90 after randomization compared with the placebo group (290 [64.4%] vs 254 [54.7%]; risk difference, 9.70%; 95% CI, 3.37%-16.03%; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.15-1.95, P = .003). The rate of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups (89.8% [405 of 450] vs 90.1% [418 of 464]).\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE\nAmong patients with AIS within 48 hours, sublingual edaravone dexborneol could improve the proportion of those achieving a favorable functional outcome at 90 days compared with placebo.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04950920.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28522181\">Title: Safety and efficacy of edaravone in well defined patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nAuthors:  | Year: 2017 | Journal: The Lancet. Neurology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn a previous phase 3 study in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), edaravone did not show a significant difference in the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score compared with placebo. Post-hoc analysis of these data revealed that patients in an early stage with definite or probable diagnosis of ALS, defined by the revised El Escorial criteria, who met a select set of inclusion criteria showed a greater magnitude of effect than did the full study population. We aimed to substantiate this post-hoc result and assess safety and efficacy of edaravone in a phase 3 trial that focused on patients with early stage ALS who met the post-hoc analysis inclusion criteria.\nMETHODS\nIn this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients aged 20-75 years with ALS of grade 1 or 2 in the Japan ALS Severity Classification, scores of at least 2 points on all 12 items of ALSFRS-R, forced vital capacity of 80% or more, definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and disease duration of 2 years or less were recruited from 31 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients also had a decrease of 1-4 points in the ALSFRS-R score during a 12-week observation period before randomisation. Patients meeting all criteria were then randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 60 mg intravenous edaravone or intravenous saline placebo for 6 cycles (4 weeks per cycle with 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) for a total treatment duration of 24 weeks. In cycle 1, the study drug or placebo was administered once per day for 14 days within a 14 day period, followed by the drug-free period. In cycle 2 and thereafter, the study drug or placebo was administered for 10 days within a 14 day period, followed by a 2 week drug-free period. Participants and investigators, including those assessing outcomes, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in ALSFRS-R score from the baseline to 24 weeks (or at discontinuation if this was after the third cycle) after randomisation. The primary outcome was assessed in all patients who had received at least one treatment infusion, had at least one assessment post-baseline, and reached the end of cycle 3. For patients with missing values at the end of cycle 6, data were imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, provided the patients had completed at least cycle 3. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one treatment infusion and had at least one assessment post-baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01492686.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Nov 28, 2011, and Sept 3, 2014, we screened 213 patients, and enrolled 192 as potential participants. Of these, 137 patients completed the observation period: 69 were randomly assigned to receive edaravone, and 68 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. 68 patients taking edaravone and 66 taking placebo were included in the primary efficacy analysis. For the primary outcome, the change in ALSFRS-R score was -5·01 (SE 0·64) in the edavarone group and -7·50 (0·66) in the placebo group. The least-squares mean difference between groups was 2·49 (SE 0·76, 95% CI 0·99-3·98; p=0·0013) in favour of edaravone. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 58 (84%) patients receiving edaravone and 57 (84%) patients receiving placebo. 11 (16%) patients taking edaravone and 16 (24%) taking placebo had serious adverse events, and one (1%) patient receiving edaravone and four (6%) patients receiving placebo had adverse events (one dysphagia in edaravone group and one dyspnoea, two respiratory disorder, and one rash in the placebo group) that led to withdrawal.\nINTERPRETATION\nEdaravone showed efficacy in a small subset of people with ALS who met criteria identified in post-hoc analysis of a previous phase 3 study, showing a significantly smaller decline of ALSFRS-R score compared with placebo. There is no indication that edaravone might be effective in a wider population of patients with ALS who do not meet the criteria.\nFUNDING\nMitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37296644\">Title: Current State and Future Directions in the Therapy of ALS.\nAuthors: Tzeplaeff, Laura, Wilfling, Sibylle, Requardt, Maria Viktoria et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Cells\nAbstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons, with death resulting mainly from respiratory failure three to five years after symptom onset. As the exact underlying causative pathological pathway is unclear and potentially diverse, finding a suitable therapy to slow down or possibly stop disease progression remains challenging. Varying by country Riluzole, Edaravone, and Sodium phenylbutyrate/Taurursodiol are the only drugs currently approved in ALS treatment for their moderate effect on disease progression. Even though curative treatment options, able to prevent or stop disease progression, are still unknown, recent breakthroughs, especially in the field of targeting genetic disease forms, raise hope for improved care and therapy for ALS patients. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of ALS therapy, including medication as well as supportive therapy, and discuss the ongoing developments and prospects in the field. Furthermore, we highlight the rationale behind the intense research on biomarkers and genetic testing as a feasible way to improve the classification of ALS patients towards personalized medicine.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39330700\">Title: Tofersen for SOD1 ALS.\nAuthors: Everett, William H, Bucelli, Robert C | Year: 2024 | Journal: Neurodegenerative disease management\nAbstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting the motor system. The heterogenous nature of ALS complicates trial design. Genetic forms of ALS present an opportunity to intervene in a less heterogeneous population. ALS associated with gain of function mutations in SOD1 make 'knock-down' strategies an attractive therapeutic approach. Tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide that reduces expression of SOD1 via RNAase mediated degradation of SOD1 mRNA, has shown robust effects on ALS biomarkers. While a Phase III trial of tofersen failed to meet its primary end point, open label extension data suggests that tofersen slows progression of SOD1 ALS.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">28350746 MCI186-19</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 13 results.

One of the Study 19 inclusion criteria was forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥80% of predicted (≥80%p). Therefore, the study provided no information on edaravone efficacy in subjects with FVC <80%p. In Study 19, 24-week, double-blind treatment was followed by open-label treatment where all subjects received edaravone. At 24 weeks, some subjects had FVC <80%p (FVC24 <80%p). This allowed for post-hoc assessment of the effects of edaravone in subgroups of subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo address the question of the efficacy of edaravone in ALS patients with FVC <80%p.\nMETHODS\nPost-hoc analysis of Study 19 comparing edaravone efficacy at week 48 in subjects with FVC24 ≥80%p vs <80%p.\nRESULTS\nWith edaravone treatment, subjects in both the FVC24 ≥80%p and the FVC24 <80%p subgroups experienced a reduction in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score loss vs placebo subjects through week 48. For the FVC24 ≥80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -7.63 for edaravone-edaravone vs -9.69 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 2.05 (P = .034; 95% CI: 0.16, 3.94). For the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, the changes in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to week 48 were -10.26 for edaravone-edaravone vs -15.20 for placebo-edaravone, a difference of 4.94 (P = .0038; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.25). Linear regression analysis indicated that, in the FVC24 <80%p subgroup, there was a notable change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R score-vs-time graph after the start of edaravone treatment.\nCONCLUSION\nALS subjects in the Study 19 placebo arm had a slowing in disease progression, even when edaravone was added with an FVC of <80%p prior to starting edaravone. A randomized, placebo-controlled study is needed to validate these post-hoc findings.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28872916\">Title: Post-hoc analysis of open-label extension period of study MCI186-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nAuthors: Takei, Koji, Tsuda, Kikumi, Takahashi, Fumihiro et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration\nAbstract: Study MCI186-19 investigated the safety and efficacy of edaravone in the treatment of ALS. The 24-week, double-blind period was followed by a 24-week, open-label, active extension period. Patients originally receiving edaravone continued edaravone (E-E group, n = 65), and patients originally receiving placebo switched to edaravone (P-E group, n = 58). Because no statistical tests had been prospectively planned in the open-label period, we performed post-hoc analyses to assist in the interpretation of efficacy data. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) were assessed. Additionally, slopes of time-dependent change between baseline in cycle 1 and the end of cycle 6 (24 weeks double-blind) and between the end of cycle 6 and end of cycle 12 (24 weeks open-label) were calculated using a random coefficient model including all available data during each period. At week 48, the MMRM analysis showed significantly less decline in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score in the E-E group than in the P-E group (least-squares mean change from baseline ± standard error, 4.17 ± 1.40, p = 0.0037), meaning that the differences in the ALSFRS-R total score during the 24-week double-blind period were maintained in patients receiving edaravone for an additional 24 weeks. The CAFS endpoint (p = 0.0089) supported this finding. The slope analysis during the double-blind period showed a significant difference between the treatment groups, while there was no significant difference between the groups during the active extension period. These analyses suggest a potential benefit of early and continued edaravone treatment over delayed edaravone treatment.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36053970\">Title: Associations between the ALSFRS-R score and urate levels during 12 months of edaravone treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Post hoc analysis of ALSFRS-R scores in clinical studies MCI186-16, MCI186-17, and MCI186-19.\nAuthors: Takahashi, Fumihiro, Kano, Osamu, Nagano, Yoshito et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Muscle & nerve\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION/AIMS\nIn this study we examined the relationship between urate levels at baseline and functional change measured by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score after edaravone treatment.\nMETHODS\nData from the edaravone trials MCI186-16, MCI186-17, and MCI186-19 were analyzed, including the following treatment sequence groups: edaravone-edaravone (EE, n = 113); edaravone-placebo (EP, n = 45); and placebo-edaravone (PE, n = 146). Subgroups were defined as low baseline urate (below the median value of 4.8 mg/dL) and high baseline urate (≥4.8 mg/dL). The differences in ALSFRS-R total score change and urate change were evaluated using the mixed model for repeated measurement for overall population, by urate-level subgroup, and by trial.\nRESULTS\nCompared with the PE group, the EE group showed a slower decline in ALSFRS-R score, regardless of the urate baseline level, and a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup. Smaller changes in ALSFRS-R score and urate were observed in patients diagnosed with \"probable, laboratory-supported ALS.\" There was a positive correlation between changes from baseline to cycle 12 in urate levels and ALSFRS-R score.\nDISCUSSION\nEdaravone treatment in ALS patients diagnosed with \"definite ALS\" or \"probable ALS\" showed slowing of disease progression, regardless of baseline urate level. In addition, because edaravone treatment was associated with a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup and urate-level changes were associated with changes in ALSFRS-R score, urate level, and/or change may be one indicator in predicting disease progression after edaravone administration.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31621933\">Title: Long-term edaravone efficacy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Post-hoc analyses of Study 19 (MCI186-19).\nAuthors: Shefner, Jeremy, Heiman-Patterson, Terry, Pioro, Erik P et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Muscle & nerve\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn a Phase 3 study, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients experienced significantly less physical functional decline with 24-week edaravone vs placebo, followed by open-label treatment for an additional 24 weeks.\nMETHODS\nOutcome (the change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, ALSFRS-R, from baseline) was projected for placebo patients through 48 weeks and compared with 48-week edaravone or 24-week edaravone after switching from placebo.\nRESULTS\nA total of 123 patients received open-label treatment (65 edaravone-edaravone; 58 placebo-edaravone). The projected ALSFRS-R decline for placebo from baseline through week 48 was greater than for 48-week edaravone (P < .0001). For patients switching from placebo to edaravone, ALSFRS-R slope approached that of continued edaravone for 48 weeks. ALSFRS-R decline did not differ between actual and projected edaravone through week 48.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with placebo, these analyses suggest that edaravone is beneficial in ALS patients even after 6 mo of receiving placebo, and efficacy is maintained for up to 1 year.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36054038\">Title: Associations between urate levels and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional score with edaravone treatment: Post hoc analysis of studies MCI186-16, MCI186-17, and MCI186-19.\nAuthors: Takahashi, Fumihiro, Kano, Osamu, Nagano, Yoshito et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Muscle & nerve\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION/AIMS\nEdaravone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was analyzed in two phase 3 studies (MCI186-16 and MCI186-19).

An association between stress and dyspepsia has been debated for decades, but the issue has not been resolved. We examined the 3-year risk of redeeming a proton-pump inhibitor or an H2-receptor antagonist as a proxy of dyspepsia according to the level of perceived stress. \\n**Participants and methods:** Perceived stress was measured in a general health survey of 16 124 Danes aged older than 16 years of age in 2010 using Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale. Data were linked individually to national registries, including the Danish National Prescription Registry. The risk of redeeming a proton-pump inhibitor or an H2-receptor antagonist for quintiles of stress level was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. \\n**Results:** In total, 2703 redeemed one of these drugs during the 33 months of follow-up.

In addition, because edaravone treatment was associated with a slower decline in urate level in the higher baseline urate subgroup and urate-level changes were associated with changes in ALSFRS-R score, urate level, and/or change may be one indicator in predicting disease progression after edaravone administration.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Muscle & nerve"}, {"paperId": "31621933", "title": "Long-term edaravone efficacy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Post-hoc analyses of Study 19 (MCI186-19).", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn a Phase 3 study, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients experienced significantly less physical functional decline with 24-week edaravone vs placebo, followed by open-label treatment for an additional 24 weeks.\nMETHODS\nOutcome (the change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, ALSFRS-R, from baseline) was projected for placebo patients through 48 weeks and compared with 48-week edaravone or 24-week edaravone after switching from placebo.\nRESULTS\nA total of 123 patients received open-label treatment (65 edaravone-edaravone; 58 placebo-edaravone).

However, most anti-Aβ antibodies also increase the CSF levels of the 42-amino acid isoform (Aβ42). We evaluated the associations of changes in CSF Aβ42 and brain Aβ-PET with cognitive and clinical end points in randomized trials of anti-Aβ drugs that lowered (β- and γ-secretase inhibitors) or increased CSF Aβ42 levels (anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies) to test the hypothesis that post-treatment increases in CSF Aβ42 levels are independently associated with cognitive and clinical outcomes. From long-term (≥12 months) randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of anti-Aβ drugs published until November 2023, we calculated the post-treatment versus baseline difference in ADAS-Cog (cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) and CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rate-Sum of Boxes) and z-standardized changes in CSF Aβ42 and Aβ-PET Centiloids (CL). We estimated the effect size [regression coefficients (RCs) and confidence intervals (CIs)] and the heterogeneity (I2) of the associations between AD biomarkers and cognitive and clinical end points using random-effects meta-regression models. We included 25 966 subjects with AD from 24 trials. In random-effects analysis, increases in CSF Aβ42 were associated with slower decline in ADAS-Cog (RC: -0.55; 95% CI: -0.89, -0.21, P = 0.003, I2 = 61.4%) and CDR-SB (RC: -0.16; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.06, P = 0.002, I2 = 34.5%). Similarly, decreases in Aβ-PET were associated with slower decline in ADAS-Cog (RC: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.89, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and CDR-SB (RC: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.33, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Higher CSF Aβ42 levels after exposure to anti-Aβ drugs are independently associated with slowing cognitive impairment and clinical decline. Increases in Aβ42 may represent a mechanism of potential benefit of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in AD.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">Centiloid change CDR-SB correlation lecanemab</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

Separate clinical trials for several therapeutic compounds that target amyloid plaque reduction have shown noteworthy correlations among plaque removal, the Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) rate, and clinical efficacy of the treatment. The relationships among therapeutic dose levels, the rate of amyloid removal, and the clinical efficacy deserve further investigation across therapeutic agents, particularly for clinical trials to provide insights for strategies to develop amyloid therapies in Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nPublished data summaries from clinical trials with amyloid therapies of aducanumab, donanemab, lecanemab, and gantenerumab are evaluated with meta-analyses. Linear mixed models for repeated measurements for visits and random study effects are applied to analyze amyloid centiloid value reduction from baseline and clinical cognition change from baseline for treatment groups according to doses and compounds for the clinical trials. Logistic regression analysis is applied to evaluate the relationship between the amyloid removal rate and the ARIA-Edema (ARIA-E) rate across different dose groups and clinical trials.\nRESULTS\nThe extent of amyloid removal varies among therapeutic agents and their dose levels. Across treatment groups and clinical trials, amyloid centiloid value reductions at Weeks 26 and 52 are strongly correlated with both ARIA-E rate over 78 weeks and the clinical efficacy response in the Clinical Dementia-Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score change from baseline at Week 78; and the Spearman rank correlations for amyloid reduction at Week 52 are stronger as - 0.79 with the ARIA-E rate over 78 weeks and 0.73 with the Week 78 CDR-SB score change from baseline.\nCONCLUSION\nAβ plaques removal in the brain due to amyloid therapy is strongly correlated with a better clinical response in patients with early Alzheimer's disease and a higher ARIA-E rate for the treatment groups and clinical trials in this meta-analysis. These relationships suggest that the balance between the clinical efficacy response and safety in ARIA-E rate is relevant for the choice of doses for amyloid therapies in confirmatory clinical trials.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">donanemab lecanemab amyloid PET meta regression CDR-SB</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 0 results.

These relationships suggest that the balance between the clinical efficacy response and safety in ARIA-E rate is relevant for the choice of doses for amyloid therapies in confirmatory clinical trials.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:39:32.119330"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "donanemab lecanemab amyloid PET meta regression CDR-SB", "result": {"total": 0, "data": []}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:39:37.211920"}], "final_answer": "Across anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody trials (including those featuring **lecanemab/CLARITY-AD** and **donanemab/TRAILBLAZER-ALZ**), the **cross-trial relationship between the magnitude of amyloid plaque reduction on PET and the magnitude of clinical slowing** is generally **moderate-to-strong**, but it is **not “tight” enough** to treat PET plaque removal as a stand-alone predictor of clinical benefit at the individual-trial level.\n\n## 1) Cross-trial correlation using amyloid PET change vs CDR-SB (and related endpoints)\nA 2022 meta-analysis pooling *dose groups across multiple amyloid-targeting agents/trials* (including lecanemab and donanemab) reported a **strong association** between greater amyloid PET reduction (Centiloid decrease) and greater clinical slowing on **CDR-SB**:\n- **Spearman correlation ~0.73** between **Week 52 amyloid reduction** and **Week 78 CDR-SB change** (treatment groups with larger PET reductions tended to have smaller/worse CDR-SB worsening). <cite id=\"35320578\">Wang et al., 2022: across dose groups/trials, Week 52 amyloid Centiloid reduction correlated with Week 78 CDR-SB change (Spearman 0.73).</cite>\n\nInterpretation: at the *between-trial / between-dose-group* level, amyloid PET reduction tracks clinical benefit reasonably well, and the association can look “strong” when you compare many regimens with very different plaque-removal potency.\n\n## 2) Meta-regression estimates (continuous association rather than simple correlation)\nA 2024 random-effects meta-regression across **24 randomized trials** (various anti-Aβ drug classes, including monoclonal antibodies) found that **larger decreases in amyloid PET** were associated with **less worsening** on both:\n- **ADAS-Cog** (regression coefficient [RC] 0.69;

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25432517\">Title: A CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants.\nAuthors: Xing, Hui-Li, Dong, Li, Wang, Zhi-Ping et al. | Year: 2014 | Journal: BMC plant biology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nTo accelerate the application of the CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated protein 9) system to a variety of plant species, a toolkit with additional plant selectable markers, more gRNA modules, and easier methods for the assembly of one or more gRNA expression cassettes is required.\nRESULTS\nWe developed a CRISPR/Cas9 binary vector set based on the pGreen or pCAMBIA backbone, as well as a gRNA (guide RNA) module vector set, as a toolkit for multiplex genome editing in plants. This toolkit requires no restriction enzymes besides BsaI to generate final constructs harboring maize-codon optimized Cas9 and one or more gRNAs with high efficiency in as little as one cloning step. The toolkit was validated using maize protoplasts, transgenic maize lines, and transgenic Arabidopsis lines and was shown to exhibit high efficiency and specificity. More importantly, using this toolkit, targeted mutations of three Arabidopsis genes were detected in transgenic seedlings of the T1 generation. Moreover, the multiple-gene mutations could be inherited by the next generation.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe developed a toolkit that facilitates transient or stable expression of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in a variety of plant species, which will facilitate plant research, as it enables high efficiency generation of mutants bearing multiple gene mutations.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"23287722\">Title: RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.\nAuthors: Mali, Prashant, Yang, Luhan, Esvelt, Kevin M et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)\nAbstract: Bacteria and archaea have evolved adaptive immune defenses, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems, that use short RNA to direct degradation of foreign nucleic acids. Here, we engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR system to function with custom guide RNA (gRNA) in human cells. For the endogenous AAVS1 locus, we obtained targeting rates of 10 to 25% in 293T cells, 13 to 8% in K562 cells, and 2 to 4% in induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that this process relies on CRISPR components; is sequence-specific; and, upon simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs, can effect multiplex editing of target loci. We also compute a genome-wide resource of ~190 K unique gRNAs targeting ~40.5% of human exons. Our results establish an RNA-guided editing tool for facile, robust, and multiplexable human genome engineering.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24651067\">Title: CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing: progress, implications and challenges.\nAuthors: Zhang, Feng, Wen, Yan, Guo, Xiong | Year: 2014 | Journal: Human molecular genetics\nAbstract: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein 9 system provides a robust and multiplexable genome editing tool, enabling researchers to precisely manipulate specific genomic elements, and facilitating the elucidation of target gene function in biology and diseases. CRISPR/Cas9 comprises of a nonspecific Cas9 nuclease and a set of programmable sequence-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which can guide Cas9 to cleave DNA and generate double-strand breaks at target sites. Subsequent cellular DNA repair process leads to desired insertions, deletions or substitutions at target sites. The specificity of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage requires target sequences matching crRNA and a protospacer adjacent motif locating at downstream of target sequences. Here, we review the molecular mechanism, applications and challenges of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and clinical therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in future.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37735597\">Title: Defining E3 ligase-substrate relationships through multiplex CRISPR screening.\nAuthors: Timms, Richard T, Mena, Elijah L, Leng, Yumei et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Nature cell biology\nAbstract: Specificity within the ubiquitin-proteasome system is primarily achieved through E3 ubiquitin ligases, but for many E3s their substrates-and in particular the molecular features (degrons) that they recognize-remain largely unknown. Current approaches for assigning E3s to their cognate substrates are tedious and low throughput. Here we developed a multiplex CRISPR screening platform to assign E3 ligases to their cognate substrates at scale. A proof-of-principle multiplex screen successfully performed ~100 CRISPR screens in a single experiment, refining known C-degron pathways and identifying an additional pathway through which Cul2 FEM1B targets C-terminal proline. Further, by identifying substrates for Cul1 FBXO38 , Cul2 APPBP2 , Cul3 GAN , Cul3 KLHL8 , Cul3 KLHL9/13 and Cul3 KLHL15 , we demonstrate that the approach is compatible with pools of full-length protein substrates of varying stabilities and, when combined with site-saturation mutagenesis, can assign E3 ligases to their cognate degron motifs. Thus, multiplex CRISPR screening will accelerate our understanding of how specificity is achieved within the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23287718/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"google_search\">PMID 23287718 multiplex editing efficiency indel distribution</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\n<snippet id=\"G1\">Title: Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems\nby L Cong · 2013 · Cited by 20317 — Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian ...Read more\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23287718/</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"G2\">Title: Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems.\nLastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian ...Read more\nURL: https://www.uniprot.org/citations/23287718</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"G3\">Title: CRISPR Guide\nPrime editing requires more optimization and typically has lower efficiency (< 50%) than base editing (> 90%), while also producing more indels.Read more\nURL: https://www.addgene.org/guides/crispr/</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"G4\">Title: Full article: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering ...\nby SJ Gratz · 2013 · Cited by 149 — Using a plasmid-based injection paradigm to generate indels at 4 targets in 2 genes, we observed mutant progeny at rates ranging from 0.25 to 22%Citation (Read more\nURL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/fly.26566</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"G5\">Title: CRISPR and Target-Specific DNA Endonucleases for ...\nby SH Lee · 2018 · Cited by 41 — Modification of donor DNA has also been reported to be effective in increasing genome editing efficiency by HDR. ...

We report that at least 101 of 987 patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against interferon-ω (IFN-ω) (13 patients), against the 13 types of IFN-α (36), or against both (52) at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three type I IFNs. The auto-Abs neutralize the ability of the corresponding type I IFNs to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. These auto-Abs were not found in 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and were present in only 4 of 1227 healthy individuals. Patients with auto-Abs were aged 25 to 87 years and 95 of the 101 were men.

However, it is unclear whether anti-IFN-α autoantibodies in the airways, the initial site of infection, can also determine disease outcomes. In this study, we developed a multiparameter technology, FlowBEAT, to quantify and profile the isotypes of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-IFN-α antibodies in longitudinal samples collected over 20 months from the airways and blood of 129 donors spanning mild to severe COVID-19. We found that nasal IgA1 anti-IFN-α autoantibodies were induced after infection onset in more than 70% of mild and moderate COVID-19 cases and were associated with robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, fewer symptoms, and efficient recovery. Nasal anti-IFN-α autoantibodies followed the peak of host IFN-α production and waned with disease recovery, revealing a regulated balance between IFN-α and anti-IFN-α response. In contrast, systemic IgG1 anti-IFN-α autoantibodies appeared later and were detected only in a subset of patients with elevated systemic inflammation and worsening symptoms. These data reveal a protective role for nasal anti-IFN-α in the immunopathology of COVID-19 and suggest that anti-IFN-α autoantibodies may serve a homeostatic function to regulate host IFN-α after viral infection in the respiratory mucosa.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34745149\">Title: Dermatomyositis With Anti-MDA5 Antibodies: Bioclinical Features, Pathogenesis and Emerging Therapies.\nAuthors: Nombel, Anaïs, Fabien, Nicole, Coutant, Frédéric | Year: 2021 | Journal: Frontiers in immunology\nAbstract: Anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis is a rare systemic autoimmune disease, historically described in Japanese patients with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis and life-threatening rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. Subsequently, the complete clinical spectrum of the disease was enriched by skin, articular and vascular manifestations. Depending on the predominance of these symptoms, three distinct clinical phenotypes with different prognosis are now defined. To date, the only known molecular component shared by the three entities are specific antibodies targeting MDA5, a cytosolic protein essential for antiviral host immune responses. Several biological tools have emerged to detect these antibodies, with drawbacks and limitations for each of them. However, the identification of this highly specific serological marker of the disease raises the question of its role in the pathogenesis. Although current knowledge on the pathogenic mechanisms that take place in the disease are still in their enfancy, several lines of evidence support a central role of interferon-mediated vasculopathy in the development of skin and lung lesions, as well as a possible pathogenic involvement of anti-MDA5 antibodies. Here, we review the clinical and biological evidences in favor of these hypothesis, and we discuss the contribution of emerging therapies that shed some light on the pathogenesis of the disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35003106\">Title: Anti-Interferon Autoantibodies in Adult-Onset Immunodeficiency Syndrome and Severe COVID-19 Infection.\nAuthors: Chen, Long-Fang, Yang, Cheng-De, Cheng, Xiao-Bing | Year: 2021 | Journal: Frontiers in immunology\nAbstract: Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome due to anti-interferon (IFN)-γ autoantibodies has attracted much attention in recent years. It usually occurs in previously healthy people and usually presents as chronic, recurrent, and hard-to-control infections that can be effectively treated with aggressive antibiotic therapy. Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome is also referred to as AIDS-like syndrome. Anti-type I IFN (IFN-I) autoantibodies have been reported to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and preexisting anti-IFN-I autoantibodies are associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. This review summarizes the effects of anti-IFN autoantibodies on the susceptibility and severity of various infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we discuss the role of anti-IFN autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases that are characterized by recurrent infections.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38571960\">Title: Alveolar cytokines and interferon autoantibodies in COVID-19 ARDS.\nAuthors: Jonassen, Trine B, Jørgensen, Sofie E, Mitchell, Nikki H et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Frontiers in immunology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nType I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN autoantibodies play a crucial role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. The levels of these mediators have only rarely been studied in the alveolar compartment in patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) but have not been compared across different ARDS etiologies, and the potential effect of dexamethasone (DXM) on these mediators is not known.\nMETHODS\nWe assessed the integrity of the alveolo-capillary membrane, interleukins, type I, II, and III IFNs, and IFN autoantibodies by studying the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) volumes, alveolar concentration of protein, and ELF-corrected concentrations of cytokines in two patient subgroups and controls.\nRESULTS\nA total of 16 patients with CARDS (four without and 12 with DXM treatment), eight with non-CARDS, and 15 healthy controls were included. The highest ELF volumes and protein levels were observed in CARDS. Systemic and ELF-corrected alveolar concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 appeared to be particularly low in patients with CARDS receiving DXM, whereas alveolar levels of IL-8 were high regardless of DXM treatment. Alveolar levels of IFNs were similar between CARDS and non-CARDS patients, and IFNα and IFNω autoantibody levels were higher in patients with CARDS and non-CARDS than in healthy controls.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients with CARDS exhibited greater alveolo-capillary barrier disruption with compartmentalization of IL-8, regardless of DXM treatment, whereas systemic and alveolar levels of IL-6 were lower in the DXM-treated subgroup. IFN-I autoantibodies were higher in the BALF of CARDS patients, independent of DXM, whereas IFN autoantibodies in plasma were similar to those in controls.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">32972995 inborn errors interferon COVID-19</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 80 results.

We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34671122\">Title: The type I interferonopathies: 10 years on.\nAuthors: Crow, Yanick J, Stetson, Daniel B | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature reviews. Immunology\nAbstract: As brutally demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, an effective immune system is essential for survival. Developed over evolutionary time, viral nucleic acid detection is a central pillar in the defensive armamentarium used to combat foreign microbial invasion. To ensure cellular homeostasis, such a strategy necessitates the efficient discrimination of pathogen-derived DNA and RNA from that of the host. In 2011, it was suggested that an upregulation of type I interferon signalling might serve as a defining feature of a novel set of Mendelian inborn errors of immunity, where antiviral sensors are triggered by host nucleic acids due to a failure of self versus non-self discrimination. These rare disorders have played a surprisingly significant role in informing our understanding of innate immunity and the relevance of type I interferon signalling for human health and disease. Here we consider what we have learned in this time, and how the field may develop in the future.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32972996\">Title: Autoantibodies against type I IFNs in patients with life-threatening COVID-19.\nAuthors: Bastard, Paul, Rosen, Lindsey B, Zhang, Qian et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)\nAbstract: Interindividual clinical variability in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is vast.

Both types of IFNs induce the transcription factor IRF1. We describe unrelated children with inherited complete IRF1 deficiency and early-onset, multiple, life-threatening diseases caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria and related intramacrophagic pathogens.

In leukocytes or fibroblasts stimulated in vitro, IRF1-dependent responses to IFN-γ are, both quantitatively and qualitatively, much stronger than those to IFN-α/β. Moreover, IRF1-deficient mononuclear phagocytes do not control mycobacteria and related pathogens normally when stimulated with IFN-γ. By contrast, IFN-α/β-dependent intrinsic immunity to nine viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, is almost normal in IRF1-deficient fibroblasts.

The risk of COVID-19 pneumonia in unvaccinated children, which is much lower than in unvaccinated adults, remains unexplained. In an international cohort of 112 children (<16 yr old) hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, we report 12 children (10.7%) aged 1.5-13 yr with critical (7 children), severe (3), and moderate (2) pneumonia and 4 of the 15 known clinically recessive and biochemically complete inborn errors of type I IFN immunity: X-linked recessive TLR7 deficiency (7 children) and autosomal recessive IFNAR1 (1), STAT2 (1), or TYK2 (3) deficiencies. Fibroblasts deficient for IFNAR1, STAT2, or TYK2 are highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. These 15 deficiencies were not found in 1,224 children and adults with benign SARS-CoV-2 infection without pneumonia (P = 1.2 × 10-11) and with overlapping age, sex, consanguinity, and ethnicity characteristics. Recessive complete deficiencies of type I IFN immunity may underlie ∼10% of hospitalizations for COVID-19 pneumonia in children.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n## Type I interferon (IFN-I) neutralizing autoantibodies (Science 2020; PMID: 32972996)\n**Prevalence in severe/critical COVID-19:**  \n- **101/987 (10.2%)** patients with *life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia* had **neutralizing IgG autoantibodies against IFN-α and/or IFN-ω** at disease onset. <cite id=\"32972996\">Bastard et al., Science 2020</cite>\n\n**Prevalence in controls:**  \n- **0/663 (0%)** in individuals with *asymptomatic or mild infection*. <cite id=\"32972996\">Bastard et al., Science 2020</cite>  \n- **4/1227 (0.33%)** in *healthy individuals*. <cite id=\"32972996\">Bastard et al., Science 2020</cite>\n\n**Effect size vs controls (from reported counts):**  \n- Versus **mild/asymptomatic infection (0/663)**: the crude OR is mathematically **infinite** (no events in controls).

The highest ELF volumes and protein levels were observed in CARDS. Systemic and ELF-corrected alveolar concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 appeared to be particularly low in patients with CARDS receiving DXM, whereas alveolar levels of IL-8 were high regardless of DXM treatment.

Clinical trials are in progress using MEK inhibitors following disease progression in patients receiving BRAF inhibitors. However, the PI3K/AKT pathway can also induce resistance to the inhibitors of MAPK pathway.\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nThe sensitivity to vemurafenib or the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 was tested in sensitive and resistant human melanoma cell lines exploring differences in activation-associated phosphorylation levels of major signaling molecules, leading to the testing of co-inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway genetically and pharmacologically. There was a high degree of cross-resistance to vemurafenib and AZD6244, except in two vemurafenib-resistant cell lines that acquired a secondary mutation in NRAS. In other cell lines, acquired resistance to both drugs was associated with persistence or increase in activity of AKT pathway. siRNA-mediated gene silencing and combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor or rapamycin partially or completely reversed the resistance.\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nPrimary and acquired resistance to vemurafenib in these in vitro models results in frequent cross resistance to MEK inhibitors, except when the resistance is the result of a secondary NRAS mutation. Resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is associated with the induction or persistence of activity within the AKT pathway in the presence of these drugs.

Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">Johannessen 20130521 melanoma</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 0 results.

Treatment options are unspecific and offer partial cures at best because available therapies do not primarily treat glomerular cells but rather act systemically and thus cause many side effects. Most glomerulopathies directly stem from injury to podocytes, cells that have a key role in the maintenance of the glomerular filter. Thus, these cells constitute an obvious and promising target for the development of novel kidney-protective drugs. During the last decade, enormous advances have been made in the understanding of podocyte structure and function. A number of pathways that are altered during glomerular diseases may be targeted by novel small- and large-molecule drugs as well as biologicals that have been identified in nephrology and other areas of drug development. Cultured podocytes provide a valuable model for high-throughput drug screening assays. Furthermore, podocytes have been shown to possess many features that make them particularly good target cells for renal protection. This mini-review discusses some of the most recent promising data related to potential drug therapy for proteinuria and kidney disease through direct podocyte targeting. \\n##  Publication types \\n  * Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural \\n  * Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. \\n  * Review \\n\\n\\n##  MeSH terms \\n  * Dosage Forms \\n  * Kidney / physiopathology \\n  * Kidney Diseases / drug therapy* \\n  * Kidney Diseases / pathology \\n  * Kidney Diseases / physiopathology \\n  * Kidney Failure, Chronic / drug therapy \\n  * Kidney Failure, Chronic / pathology \\n  * Kidney Failure, Chronic / physiopathology \\n  * Kidney Glomerulus / cytology \\n  * Kidney Glomerulus / pathology* \\n  * Kidney Glomerulus / physiopathology* \\n  * Pharmaceutical Preparations \\n  * Physiological Phenomena / drug effects \\n  * Podocytes / drug effects \\n  * Podocytes / pathology* \\n  * Proteinuria / drug therapy \\n  * Proteinuria / pathology \\n  * Proteinuria / physiopathology* \\n\\n\\n##  Substances \\n  * Dosage Forms \\n  * Pharmaceutical Preparations \\n\\n\\n##  Grants and funding \\n  * R03 NS053659/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States \\n  * DK073495/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \\n  * K01 DK068253/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \\n  * K01DK068253/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States \\n  * R03NS053659/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United State"}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:40:17.268753"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "Nazarian 20130528 melanoma", "result": {"total": 0, "data": []}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:40:24.053435"}, {"tool_name": "pubmed_search", "parameters": {"limit": 5}, "query": "BRAF inhibitor resistance NRAS Nazarian", "result": {"total": 2, "data": [{"paperId": "22194965", "title": "Reversing melanoma cross-resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors by co-targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe sustained clinical activity of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG7204) in patients with BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma is limited primarily by the development of acquired resistance leading to tumor progression. Clinical trials are in progress using MEK inhibitors following disease progression in patients receiving BRAF inhibitors. However, the PI3K/AKT pathway can also induce resistance to the inhibitors of MAPK pathway.\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS\nThe sensitivity to vemurafenib or the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 was tested in sensitive and resistant human melanoma cell lines exploring differences in activation-associated phosphorylation levels of major signaling molecules, leading to the testing of co-inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway genetically and pharmacologically. There was a high degree of cross-resistance to vemurafenib and AZD6244, except in two vemurafenib-resistant cell lines that acquired a secondary mutation in NRAS. In other cell lines, acquired resistance to both drugs was associated with persistence or increase in activity of AKT pathway. siRNA-mediated gene silencing and combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor or rapamycin partially or completely reversed the resistance.\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE\nPrimary and acquired resistance to vemurafenib in these in vitro models results in frequent cross resistance to MEK inhibitors, except when the resistance is the result of a secondary NRAS mutation. Resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is associated with the induction or persistence of activity within the AKT pathway in the presence of these drugs.

The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 28 in the total score on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R; range, 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function) among participants predicted to have faster-progressing disease. Secondary end points included changes in the total concentration of SOD1 protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the concentration of neurofilament light chains in plasma, in slow vital capacity, and in handheld dynamometry in 16 muscles. A combined analysis of the randomized component of the trial and its open-label extension at 52 weeks compared the results in participants who started tofersen at trial entry (early-start cohort) with those in participants who switched from placebo to the drug at week 28 (delayed-start cohort).\nRESULTS\nA total of 72 participants received tofersen (39 predicted to have faster progression), and 36 received placebo (21 predicted to have faster progression). Tofersen led to greater reductions in concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma than placebo. In the faster-progression subgroup (primary analysis), the change to week 28 in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.98 with tofersen and -8.14 with placebo (difference, 1.2 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.2 to 5.5; P = 0.97). Results for secondary clinical end points did not differ significantly between the two groups. A total of 95 participants (88%) entered the open-label extension. At 52 weeks, the change in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.0 in the early-start cohort and -9.5 in the delayed-start cohort (difference, 3.5 points; 95% CI, 0.4 to 6.7); non-multiplicity-adjusted differences favoring early-start tofersen were seen for other end points. Lumbar puncture-related adverse events were common. Neurologic serious adverse events occurred in 7% of tofersen recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn persons with SOD1 ALS, tofersen reduced concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma over 28 weeks but did not improve clinical end points and was associated with adverse events. The potential effects of earlier as compared with delayed initiation of tofersen are being further evaluated in the extension phase.

In this study we assess neurofilament light chain (NfL) before and during tofersen treatment.\nMETHODS\nIn six SOD1-ALS patients treated with tofersen at three specialized ALS centers in Germany, NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-NfL) and/or serum (sNfL) were investigated using the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) and ALS progression rate (ALS-PR), defined by monthly decline of ALSFRS-R.\nRESULTS\nThree of the six SOD1-ALS patients reported a negative family history. Three patients harbored a homozygous c.272A > C, p.(Asp91Ala) mutation. These and two other patients showed slower progressing ALS (defined by ALS-PR <0.9), whereas one patient demonstrated rapidly progressing ALS (ALS-PR = 2.66). Mean treatment duration was 6.5 (range 5 to 8) months. In all patients, NfL decreased (mean CSF-NfL: -66%, range -52% to -86%; mean sNfL: -62%, range -36% to -84%). sNfL after 5 months of tofersen treatment was significantly reduced compared with the nearest pretreatment measurement (P = .017). ALS-PR decreased in two patients, whereas no changes in ALSFRS-R were observed in four participants who had very low ALS-PR or ALSFRS-R values before treatment.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this case series, the significant NfL decline after tofersen treatment confirmed its value as response biomarker in an expanded clinical spectrum of SOD1-ALS. Given the previously reported strong correlation between sNfL and ALS progression, the NfL treatment response supports the notion of tofersen having disease-modifying activity.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38384337\">Title: Effects of tofersen treatment in patients with SOD1 -ALS in a \"real-world\" setting - a 12-month multicenter cohort study from the German early access program.\nAuthors: Wiesenfarth, Maximilian, Dorst, Johannes, Brenner, David et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: EClinicalMedicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn April 2023, the antisense oligonucleotide tofersen was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of SOD1 -amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), after a decrease of neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels had been demonstrated.\nMETHODS\nBetween 03/2022 and 04/2023, 24 patients with SOD1 -ALS from ten German ALS reference centers were followed-up until the cut-off date for ALS functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), progression rate (loss of ALSFRS-R/month), NfL, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and adverse events.\nFINDINGS\nDuring the observation period, median ALSFRS-R decreased from 38.0 (IQR 32.0-42.0) to 35.0 (IQR 29.0-42.0), corresponding to a median progression rate of 0.11 (IQR -0.09 to 0.32) points of ALSFRS-R lost per month. Median serum NfL declined from 78.0 pg/ml (IQR 37.0-147.0 pg/ml; n = 23) to 36.0 pg/ml (IQR 22.0-65.0 pg/ml; n = 23; p = 0.02), median pNfH in CSF from 2226 pg/ml (IQR 1061-6138 pg/ml; n = 18) to 1151 pg/ml (IQR 521-2360 pg/ml; n = 18; p = 0.02). In the CSF, we detected a pleocytosis in 73% of patients (11 of 15) and an intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis (IgG, IgM, or IgA) in 9 out of 10 patients. Two drug-related serious adverse events were reported.\nINTERPRETATION\nConsistent with the VALOR study and its Open Label Extension (OLE), our results confirm a reduction of NfL serum levels, and moreover show a reduction of pNfH in CSF. The therapy was safe, as no persistent symptoms were observed. Pleocytosis and Ig synthesis in CSF with clinical symptoms related to myeloradiculitis in two patients, indicate the potential of an autoimmune reaction.\nFUNDING\nNo funding was received towards this study.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38758193\">Title: Profiling tofersen as a treatment of superoxide dismutase 1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nAuthors: Oliveira Santos, Miguel, de Carvalho, Mamede | Year: 2024 | Journal: Expert review of neurotherapeutics\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive motor neuron disorder with a fatal outcome 3-5 years after disease onset due to respiratory complications. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations are found in about 2% of all patients. Tofersen is a novel oligonucleotide antisense drug specifically developed to treat SOD1-ALS patients.\nAREAS COVERED\nOur review covers and discusses tofersen pharmacological properties and its phase I/II and III clinical trials results. Other available drugs and their limitations are also addressed.\nEXPERT OPINION\nVALOR study failed to meet the primary endpoint (change in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score from baseline to week 28, tofersen arm vs. placebo), but a significant reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels was observed in tofersen arm (60% vs. 20%). PrefALS study has proposed plasma NfL has a potential biomarker for presymptomatic treatment, since it increases 6-12 months before phenoconversion.

The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 28 in the total score on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R; range, 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function) among participants predicted to have faster-progressing disease. Secondary end points included changes in the total concentration of SOD1 protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the concentration of neurofilament light chains in plasma, in slow vital capacity, and in handheld dynamometry in 16 muscles. A combined analysis of the randomized component of the trial and its open-label extension at 52 weeks compared the results in participants who started tofersen at trial entry (early-start cohort) with those in participants who switched from placebo to the drug at week 28 (delayed-start cohort).\nRESULTS\nA total of 72 participants received tofersen (39 predicted to have faster progression), and 36 received placebo (21 predicted to have faster progression). Tofersen led to greater reductions in concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma than placebo. In the faster-progression subgroup (primary analysis), the change to week 28 in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.98 with tofersen and -8.14 with placebo (difference, 1.2 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.2 to 5.5; P = 0.97). Results for secondary clinical end points did not differ significantly between the two groups. A total of 95 participants (88%) entered the open-label extension. At 52 weeks, the change in the ALSFRS-R score was -6.0 in the early-start cohort and -9.5 in the delayed-start cohort (difference, 3.5 points; 95% CI, 0.4 to 6.7); non-multiplicity-adjusted differences favoring early-start tofersen were seen for other end points. Lumbar puncture-related adverse events were common. Neurologic serious adverse events occurred in 7% of tofersen recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn persons with SOD1 ALS, tofersen reduced concentrations of SOD1 in CSF and of neurofilament light chains in plasma over 28 weeks but did not improve clinical end points and was associated with adverse events. The potential effects of earlier as compared with delayed initiation of tofersen are being further evaluated in the extension phase.

Tofersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that induces SOD1 mRNA degradation. In the 28-week, placebo-controlled, multinational, phase III VALOR trial, intrathecally administered tofersen reduced plasma concentrations of neurofilament proteins (biomarker for neuro-axonal injury) and total SOD1 protein in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with SOD1 mutation-associated ALS. These reductions were sustained in a long-term, open-label extension study. The decline in functional outcomes was not significantly reduced with tofersen treatment compared with placebo in the 28-week phase III trial, although in the longer-term open-label study, early tofersen initiation was associated with slowed functional decline versus delayed tofersen initiation. Tofersen had an acceptable tolerability profile in clinical trials with a favourable benefit-to-risk balance. In summary, tofersen is a new disease-modifying therapy for patients with ALS attributed to an SOD1 mutation, offering reductions in levels of a biomarker associated with neurodegeneration and disease progression, with an acceptable tolerability profile.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38384337\">Title: Effects of tofersen treatment in patients with SOD1 -ALS in a \"real-world\" setting - a 12-month multicenter cohort study from the German early access program.\nAuthors: Wiesenfarth, Maximilian, Dorst, Johannes, Brenner, David et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: EClinicalMedicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn April 2023, the antisense oligonucleotide tofersen was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of SOD1 -amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), after a decrease of neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels had been demonstrated.\nMETHODS\nBetween 03/2022 and 04/2023, 24 patients with SOD1 -ALS from ten German ALS reference centers were followed-up until the cut-off date for ALS functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), progression rate (loss of ALSFRS-R/month), NfL, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and adverse events.\nFINDINGS\nDuring the observation period, median ALSFRS-R decreased from 38.0 (IQR 32.0-42.0) to 35.0 (IQR 29.0-42.0), corresponding to a median progression rate of 0.11 (IQR -0.09 to 0.32) points of ALSFRS-R lost per month.

In this study we assess neurofilament light chain (NfL) before and during tofersen treatment.\nMETHODS\nIn six SOD1-ALS patients treated with tofersen at three specialized ALS centers in Germany, NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-NfL) and/or serum (sNfL) were investigated using the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) and ALS progression rate (ALS-PR), defined by monthly decline of ALSFRS-R.\nRESULTS\nThree of the six SOD1-ALS patients reported a negative family history. Three patients harbored a homozygous c.272A > C, p.(Asp91Ala) mutation. These and two other patients showed slower progressing ALS (defined by ALS-PR <0.9), whereas one patient demonstrated rapidly progressing ALS (ALS-PR = 2.66). Mean treatment duration was 6.5 (range 5 to 8) months. In all patients, NfL decreased (mean CSF-NfL: -66%, range -52% to -86%; mean sNfL: -62%, range -36% to -84%). sNfL after 5 months of tofersen treatment was significantly reduced compared with the nearest pretreatment measurement (P = .017). ALS-PR decreased in two patients, whereas no changes in ALSFRS-R were observed in four participants who had very low ALS-PR or ALSFRS-R values before treatment.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this case series, the significant NfL decline after tofersen treatment confirmed its value as response biomarker in an expanded clinical spectrum of SOD1-ALS.

It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk.\nMETHODS\nIn this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated.\nRESULTS\nIn 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P = 0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9% of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4% of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

The EAST-AFNET 4 trial demonstrated that early, systematic rhythm control improves clinical outcomes compared to symptom-directed rhythm control.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThis prespecified EAST-AFNET 4 analysis compared the effect of early rhythm control therapy in asymptomatic patients (EHRA score I) to symptomatic patients. Primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome, analyzed in a time-to-event analysis. At baseline, 801/2633 (30.4%) patients were asymptomatic [mean age 71.3 years, 37.5% women, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score 3.4, 169/801 (21.1%) heart failure]. Asymptomatic patients randomized to early rhythm control (395/801) received similar rhythm control therapies compared to symptomatic patients [e.g. AF ablation at 24 months: 75/395 (19.0%) in asymptomatic; 176/910 (19.3%) symptomatic patients, P = 0.672]. Anticoagulation and treatment of concomitant cardiovascular conditions was not different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The primary outcome occurred in 79/395 asymptomatic patients randomized to early rhythm control and in 97/406 patients randomized to usual care (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval [0.6; 1.03]), almost identical to symptomatic patients. At 24 months follow-up, change in symptom status was not different between randomized groups (P = 0.19).\nCONCLUSION\nThe clinical benefit of early, systematic rhythm control was not different between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in EAST-AFNET 4. These results call for a shared decision discussing the benefits of rhythm control therapy in all patients with recently diagnosed AF and concomitant cardiovascular conditions (EAST-AFNET 4; ISRCTN04708680; NCT01288352; EudraCT2010-021258-20).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38702961\">Title: Safety and efficacy of long-term sodium channel blocker therapy for early rhythm control: the EAST-AFNET 4 trial.\nAuthors: Rillig, Andreas, Eckardt, Lars, Borof, Katrin et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology\nAbstract: AIMS\nClinical concerns exist about the potential proarrhythmic effects of the sodium channel blockers (SCBs) flecainide and propafenone in patients with cardiovascular disease. Sodium channel blockers were used to deliver early rhythm control (ERC) therapy in EAST-AFNET 4.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nWe analysed the primary safety outcome (death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm control therapy) and primary efficacy outcome (cardiovascular death, stroke, and hospitalization for worsening of heart failure (HF) or acute coronary syndrome) during SCB intake for patients with ERC (n = 1395) in EAST-AFNET 4. The protocol discouraged flecainide and propafenone in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and suggested stopping therapy upon QRS prolongation >25% on therapy. Flecainide or propafenone was given to 689 patients [age 69 (8) years; CHA2DS2-VASc 3.2 (1); 177 with HF; 41 with prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention; 26 with left ventricular hypertrophy >15 mm; median therapy duration 1153 [237, 1828] days]. The primary efficacy outcome occurred less often in patients treated with SCB [3/100 (99/3316) patient-years] than in patients who never received SCB [SCBnever 4.9/100 (150/3083) patient-years, P < 0.001]. There were numerically fewer primary safety outcomes in patients receiving SCB [2.9/100 (96/3359) patient-years] than in SCBnever patients [4.2/100 (135/3220) patient-years, adjusted P = 0.015]. Sinus rhythm at 2 years was similar between groups [SCB 537/610 (88); SCBnever 472/579 (82)].\nCONCLUSION\nLong-term therapy with flecainide or propafenone appeared to be safe in the EAST-AFNET 4 trial to deliver effective ERC therapy, including in selected patients with stable cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease and stable HF.

This study aimed to evaluate the generalizability of EAST-AFNET 4 in routine practice. Methods and Results Using a US administrative database, we identified 109 739 patients with newly diagnosed AF during the enrollment period of EAST-AFNET 4. Patients were classified as either receiving ERC, using AF ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy, within the first year after AF diagnosis (n=27 106) or not receiving ERC (control group, n=82 633). After propensity score overlap weighting, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare groups for the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality, stroke, or hospitalization with the diagnoses heart failure or myocardial infarction. Most patients (79 948 of 109 739; 72.9%) met the inclusion criteria for EAST-AFNET 4. ERC was associated with a reduced risk for the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97 [ P =0.02]) with largely consistent results between eligible (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76-1.04 [ P =0.14]) or ineligible (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98 [ P =0.04]) patients for EAST-AFNET 4 trial inclusion. ERC was associated with lower risk of stroke in the overall cohort and in trial-eligible patients. Conclusions This analysis replicates the clinical benefit of ERC seen in EAST-AFNET 4. The results support adoption of ERC as part of the management of recently diagnosed AF in the United States.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"40387892\">Title: Safety and efficacy of amiodarone and dronedarone for early rhythm control in EAST-AFNET 4.\nAuthors: Rottner, Laura, Lemoine, Marc D, Eckardt, Lars et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society\nAbstract: AIMS\nConcerns exist about the safety of amiodarone and dronedarone. We assessed the long-term outcome of both drugs for early rhythm control (ERC) in the EAST-AFNET 4 trial.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nPatients randomized for ERC and treated with amiodarone or dronedarone were compared to other ERC-therapies. Patients receiving amiodarone or dronedarone at initial therapy (n = 653/1395) were older with more comorbidities and less paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF, 29%) compared to patients never receiving amiodarone or dronedarone (Amiodarone/Dronedarone never , 43% paroxysmal AF). Patients treated with amiodarone had more often heart failure (HF, 42%) and persistent AF (40%) compared to patients treated with dronedarone (16% HF, 15% persistent AF) and Amiodarone/Dronedarone never (25% HF, 22% persistent AF). 115/398 amiodarone-treated patients (6.7/100 patient-years) and 51/255 dronedarone-treated patients (4.2/100 patient-years) experienced a primary efficacy outcome (cardiovascular death, stroke, HF-hospitalization or acute coronary syndrome), while 98/398 (5.3/100 patient-years) and 43/255 (3.4/100 patient-years) experienced a primary safety outcome (death, stroke or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy). Serious adverse events related to drug therapy were similar for amiodarone (1.4/100 patient-years), dronedarone (1.2/100 patient-years), and other ERC (0.8/100 patient-years). Dronedarone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.5; CI 0.28-0.91), age (HR 1.05; CI 1.03-1.07), coronary artery disease (HR 1.84; CI 1.38-2.46) and stable HF (HR 1.66; CI 1.28-2.16) were associated with efficacy outcome upon multivariate Cox regression. Age (HR 1.07; CI 1.05-1.09) and left ventricular hypertrophy (HR 1.94; CI 1.13-3.32) were associated with safety outcome.\nCONCLUSION\nEarly rhythm control using amiodarone or dronedarone rarely led to drug-related serious adverse events in EAST-AFNET 4.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nISRCTN04708680, NCT01288352, EudraCT2010-021258-20.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">AFFIRM atrial fibrillation trial 2002</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 12 results.

In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality.\nRESULTS\nA total of 4060 patients (mean [+/-SD] age, 69.7+/-9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.\nCONCLUSIONS\nManagement of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy, and there are potential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy. Anticoagulation should be continued in this group of high-risk patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35255732\">Title: Rate versus rhythm control for atrial fibrillation: from AFFIRM to EAST-AFNET 4 - a paradigm shift.\nAuthors: Roman, Sherif, Patel, Kevin, Hana, David et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Future cardiology\nAbstract: The clinical choice between rate or rhythm control therapies has been debated over the years. In 2002, the AFFIRM trial demonstrated that the rhythm-control strategy had no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy. Eighteen years later, EAST-AFNET 4 showed that the rhythm-control approach is better than rate control in reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). During the time between AFFIRM and EAST-AFNET 4, rhythm control understanding, specifically ablation, improved, while rate-control strategies remained the same possibly leading to the change in results seen in EAST-AFNET 4. This review seeks to evaluate the rate- and rhythm-control strategies, focusing on the important clinical trials in the past two decades. These trials have shown great advancement in AF management; however, the search for the best approach to controlling AF and minimizing the burden of symptoms is still a work in progress and needs further research.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"12232560\">Title: Atrial fibrillation following investigation of rhythm management: AFFIRM trial outcomes.

We found no difference in mortality between rhythm control and rate control relative risk 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.31).Both studies show significantly higher rates of hospitalisation and adverse events in the rhythm control group and no difference in quality of life between the two treatment groups.In AFFIRM there was a similar incidence of ischaemic stroke, bleeding and systemic embolism in the two groups. Certain malignant dysrhythmias were significantly more likely to occur in the rhythm control group. There were similar scores of cognitive assessment.In PIAF, cardioverted patients enjoyed an improved exercise tolerance but there was no overall benefit in terms of symptom control or quality of life.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThere is no evidence that pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. Rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalisation. It does not reduce the risk of stroke. The conclusions cannot be generalised to all people with atrial fibrillation. Most of the patients included in these studies were relatively older (>60 years) with significant cardiovascular risk factors.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"12075254\">Title: Baseline characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation: the AFFIRM Study.\nAuthors:  | Year: 2002 | Journal: American heart journal\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAlthough anticoagulation therapy is accepted for most patients with atrial fibrillation, 2 different strategies exist for management of the cardiac rhythm: atrial fibrillation is allowed to persist while the ventricular rate is controlled; and atrial fibrillation is converted, and an attempt is made to maintain sinus rhythm.\nMETHODS\nThe Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) Study was a randomized clinical trial that compared these 2 strategies. We report the baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in the AFFIRM Study.\nRESULTS\nMore than 7400 patients at more than 200 North American hospitals and clinics qualified for enrollment in the AFFIRM Study. A total of 4060 patients were enrolled in the AFFIRM Study. The average age of patients enrolled was 70 years, with 39% female and 89% white. Hypertension was present in 71%. Coronary artery disease was present in 38%. Echocardiography was performed in 3311 patients, and results showed normal ventricular function in 68% and normal left atrial size in 33%. Most patients with recurrent episodes had symptoms with atrial fibrillation. Approximately one third of patients were enrolled with a first episode of atrial fibrillation.\nCONCLUSION\nThe AFFIRM Study enrolled 4060 predominantly elderly patients with atrial fibrillation to compare ventricular rate control with rhythm control. The patients in the AFFIRM Study were representative of patients at high risk for complications from atrial fibrillation, which indicates that the results of this large clinical trial will be relevant to patient care.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n### What EAST-AFNET 4 found (early rhythm control) vs what AFFIRM found (rhythm vs rate control)\n\n#### EAST-AFNET 4 (early AF; early, systematic rhythm control vs “usual care”)\n- Population: recently diagnosed AF (≤1 year; median ~36 days since diagnosis) with concomitant cardiovascular conditions.\n- Strategy: *early rhythm control* (antiarrhythmic drugs and/or AF ablation started soon after randomization) vs usual care where rhythm control was largely symptom-driven.\n- Main clinical outcome: **early rhythm control reduced major adverse cardiovascular outcomes** (composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or hospitalization for worsening heart failure or acute coronary syndrome):  \n  **HR 0.79 (96% CI 0.66–0.94; P=0.005)**.  \n  Event rates: **3.9 vs 5.0 per 100 person-years** (early rhythm control vs usual care). <cite id=\"32865375\">EAST-AFNET 4: early rhythm control lowered composite CV outcomes vs usual care (HR 0.79), with event rates 3.9 vs 5.0 per 100 person-years.</cite>\n- Safety: overall primary safety composite did not differ significantly, but serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy were more frequent with early rhythm control (4.9% vs 1.4%). <cite id=\"32865375\">EAST-AFNET 4: similar primary safety composite; more therapy-related serious adverse events in early rhythm-control group.</cite>\n\n**Interpretation:** In *early* AF, initiating rhythm control early produced a measurable reduction in “hard” cardiovascular outcomes (stroke/CV death/major CV hospitalizations), not just symptom relief.\n\n---\n\n#### AFFIRM (older, higher-risk AF; rhythm control vs rate control)\n- Population: older patients with AF at high risk of stroke/death (mean age ~70), not selected for very recent diagnosis.\n- Strategy: rhythm control (cardioversion + antiarrhythmic drugs) vs rate control.\n- Main clinical outcome: **no survival advantage** with rhythm control; if anything, a trend toward worse mortality:\n  - Deaths: **356 (rhythm) vs 310 (rate)**\n  - **5-year mortality 23.8% vs 21.3%**\n  - **HR 1.15 (95% CI 0.99–1.34; P=0.08)**. <cite id=\"12466506\">AFFIRM: rhythm control showed no mortality benefit vs rate control (HR 1.15; P=0.08), with 5-year mortality 23.8% vs 21.3%.</cite>\n- Other outcomes: **more hospitalizations and more adverse drug effects** in the rhythm-control group. <cite id=\"12466506\">AFFIRM: rhythm-control strategy associated with more hospitalizations and adverse drug effects.</cite>\n- Stroke/anticoagulation nuance: many strokes occurred after warfarin discontinuation or subtherapeutic INR, underscoring that anticoagulation should not be stopped solely because sinus rhythm is achieved. <cite id=\"12466506\">AFFIRM: strokes often occurred after warfarin cessation or subtherapeutic INR.</cite>\n\n**Interpretation:** In the AFFIRM era/patient mix, a rhythm-control strategy did **not** improve survival and increased hospitalizations/adverse effects compared with rate control.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line comparison\n- **EAST-AFNET 4:** Early, systematic rhythm control in *recently diagnosed* AF **improved major cardiovascular outcomes** compared with usual care. <cite id=\"32865375\">EAST-AFNET 4 primary composite outcome benefit with early rhythm control.</cite>\n- **AFFIRM:** In an older, higher-risk AF cohort (often not “early AF”), rhythm control **did not beat rate control for mortality** and led to **more hospitalizations/adverse drug effects**. <cite id=\"12466506\">AFFIRM: no mortality benefit; higher hospitalization and adverse effects with rhythm control.</cite>\n\nA practical way to reconcile them: EAST-AFNET 4 suggests that **timing (early after diagnosis), contemporary rhythm-control options, and a goal of preventing CV events (not only symptom control)** can change the outcome profile compared with the “traditional” rhythm-control approach tested in AFFIRM. <cite id=\"32865375\">EAST-AFNET 4: early rhythm control reduced CV events.</cite> <cite id=\"12466506\">AFFIRM: rhythm control offered no survival advantage vs rate control and increased hospitalizations.</cite>\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865375/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32865375/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Early Rhythm-Control Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation \\nN Engl J Med. 2020 Oct 1;383(14):1305-1316. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2019422.

It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk.\nMETHODS\nIn this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated.\nRESULTS\nIn 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P = 0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9% of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4% of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\nEarly rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

The EAST-AFNET 4 trial demonstrated that early, systematic rhythm control improves clinical outcomes compared to symptom-directed rhythm control.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThis prespecified EAST-AFNET 4 analysis compared the effect of early rhythm control therapy in asymptomatic patients (EHRA score I) to symptomatic patients. Primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome, analyzed in a time-to-event analysis. At baseline, 801/2633 (30.4%) patients were asymptomatic [mean age 71.3 years, 37.5% women, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score 3.4, 169/801 (21.1%) heart failure]. Asymptomatic patients randomized to early rhythm control (395/801) received similar rhythm control therapies compared to symptomatic patients [e.g. AF ablation at 24 months: 75/395 (19.0%) in asymptomatic; 176/910 (19.3%) symptomatic patients, P = 0.672]. Anticoagulation and treatment of concomitant cardiovascular conditions was not different between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The primary outcome occurred in 79/395 asymptomatic patients randomized to early rhythm control and in 97/406 patients randomized to usual care (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval [0.6; 1.03]), almost identical to symptomatic patients. At 24 months follow-up, change in symptom status was not different between randomized groups (P = 0.19).\nCONCLUSION\nThe clinical benefit of early, systematic rhythm control was not different between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in EAST-AFNET 4.

The protocol discouraged flecainide and propafenone in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and suggested stopping therapy upon QRS prolongation >25% on therapy. Flecainide or propafenone was given to 689 patients [age 69 (8) years; CHA2DS2-VASc 3.2 (1); 177 with HF; 41 with prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention; 26 with left ventricular hypertrophy >15 mm; median therapy duration 1153 [237, 1828] days].

The relationship of SAEs with CVD events is unknown.\nMETHODS\nCVD events were defined as either myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. Cox models were utilized to understand the occurrence of SAEs with CVD events according to baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk.\nRESULTS\nSAEs occurred in 96% of those experiencing a CVD event but only in 34% (P < 0.001) of those not experiencing a CVD event. Occurrence of SAEs monotonically increased across the range of baseline ASCVD risk being approximately twice as great in the highest compared with the lowest risk category. SAE occurrence was strongly associated with ASCVD risk but was similar within risk groups across treatment arms. In adjusted Cox models, experiencing a CVD event was the strongest predictor of SAEs in all risk groups. By the end of year 1, the hazard ratios for the low, middle, and high ASCVD risk tertiles, and baseline clinical CVD group were 2.56 (95% CI = 1.39-4.71); 2.52 (1.63-3.89); 3.61 (2.79-4.68); 1.86 (1.37-2.54), respectively-a trend observed in subsequent years until study end. Intensive treatment independently predicted SAEs only in the second ASVCD risk tertile.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe occurrence of SAEs is multifactorial and mostly related to prerandomization patient characteristics, most prominently ASCVD risk, which, in turn, relates to in-study CVD events.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32490642\">Title: Baseline characteristics predicting clinical outcomes and serious adverse events in middle-aged hypertensive women: a subanalysis of the SPRINT in women aged <65 years.\nAuthors: Aydin, Volkan, Akici, Ahmet, Sakarya, Sibel et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Turkish journal of medical sciences\nAbstract: BACKGROUND/AIM\nThe predictability of clinical outcomes in hypertension in specific patient groups, especially underrepresented populations is the key to rational treatment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of baseline characteristics of <65-year-old hypertensive women with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, managed with standard- or intensive-approach, on their clinical outcomes and serious adverse events (SAEs).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBaseline characteristics of <65-year-old hypertensive women (n = 1247) in SPRINT, a multicenter randomized trial to compare standard and intensive antihypertensive treatment, were analyzed with Cox-regression method to determine potential predictors of the clinical outcomes and SAEs. The primary outcome was the composite of myocardial infarction (MI), non-MI acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS\nThe primary outcome occurred in 3.1% and SAEs in 27.6% of the population. The treatment groups were similar in terms of the primary outcome, SAEs, or their individual components. The primary outcome occurred significantly more in current smokers vs. nonsmokers (HR: 2.85, 95% CI: 1.34–6.09). The subjects who were on aspirin in the intensive-group were significantly more likely to develop the primary outcome (HR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.23-8.19) and MI (HR: 10.15, 95% CI: 1.19-86.88) compared with those not using aspirin. The risk of overall SAEs was significantly higher in blacks vs. nonblacks (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01-1.58), in current-smokers vs. nonsmokers (HR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.23-2.05), and those with vs. without chronic kidney disease (CKD), (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.08-1.77). The likelihood of SAEs significantly increased with age (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07).\nCONCLUSION\nSmoking, aspirin, CKD, black race, and age seemed as important baseline characteristics in follow-up of <65-year-old hypertensive women, also depending on therapeutic strategy. Clinicians are expected to consider these critical parameters for effective antihypertensive management that promotes better outcomes in this middle-aged female population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28623175\">Title: Elevated High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Is Associated with Hyponatremia in Hypertensive Patients.\nAuthors: Israel, Ariel, Grossman, Ehud | Year: 2017 | Journal: The American journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nRecently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure is beneficial, but is associated with more adverse events. Hyponatremia was notably more frequent in the intensive treatment group. Investigating its risk factors is crucial for preventing this complication. Our objective in this study was to identify risk factors for hyponatremia in the adult population.\nMETHODS\nWe investigated the baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from the 9361 participants of SPRINT to identify the best predictors of hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤130 mEq/L), and adverse events, which could be attributed to hyponatremia, using machine learning and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. We confirmed our results in the independent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort between the years 2005 and 2010 (16,501 participants).\nRESULTS\nElevated baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was a strong predictor of future hyponatremia. Multivariable Cox regression showed hyponatremia events to be significantly increased for SPRINT participants with baseline HDL-C levels in the highest quintile (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-3.7; P <.001), and were also associated with treatment-related serious adverse events (HR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.1; P <.001). We confirmed the association between HDL-C and hyponatremia in the NHANES cohort (HR 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.7; P <.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nElevated HDL-C (≥62 mg/dL) is a risk factor for hyponatremia. Thus, hypertensive patients with elevated HDL-C should be closely monitored for hyponatremia when treated for hypertension.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">SPRINT treatment related adverse events baseline</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 24 results.

At the data cutoff (DCO) of the prior publications, 65% of participants were still receiving treatment. This report presents up to 5 years of additional safety and efficacy data from these studies.\nMETHODS\nThis manuscript includes data from the phase 1 and phase 2, stratum 1 study which included participants with clinically significant PN-related morbidity. Participants received continuous selumetinib dosing (1 cycle = 28 days). Safety and efficacy data through February 27, 2021 are included. PN response assessed by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis: Confirmed partial response (cPR) ≥20% decrease from baseline on 2 consecutive evaluations. Phase 2 participants completed patient-reported outcome measures assessing tumor pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale-11) and interference of pain in daily life (pain interference index).\nRESULTS\nFor the 74 children (median age 10.3 years; range 3-18.5) enrolled, overall cPR rate was 70% (52/74); median duration of treatment was 57.5 cycles (range 1-100). Responses were generally sustained with 59% (44) lasting ≥ 12 cycles. Tumor pain intensity (n = 19, P = .015) and pain interference (n = 18, P = .0059) showed durable improvement from baseline to 48 cycles. No new safety signals were identified; however, some developed known selumetinib-related adverse events (AEs) for the first time after several years of treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith up to 5 years of additional selumetinib treatment, most children with NF1-related PN had durable tumor shrinkage and sustained improvement in pain beyond that previously reported at 1 year. No new safety signals were identified; however, ongoing monitoring for known selumetinib-related AEs is needed while treatment continues.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29058304\">Title: Serious Adverse Events Among SPRINT Trial Participants Taking Statins at Baseline.\nAuthors: Huesch, Marco D | Year: 2017 | Journal: Drugs in R&D\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nReal-world evidence of statin side effects is potentially biased because statin use is neither randomized nor unblinded. An innovative study design can mitigate these biases. For example, in the recent ASCOT-LLA trial, patient-reported adverse events such as muscle pain and weakness were higher in the non-randomized and non-blinded setting than in the randomized, blinded setting. Less optimally, secondary re-analysis of clinical trials in which statin use is recorded and in which serious adverse events (SAEs) are adjudicated may be conducted.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate SAEs by statin use at baseline among participants in the SPRINT blood pressure (BP) management trial.\nMETHODS\nUnadjusted overall SAE and treatment-related SAE rates by statin use as well as adjusted hazard ratios for statin use were computed in four cohorts [by baseline clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), by intervention arm].\nRESULTS\nStatin use at baseline was not associated with higher overall or treatment-related SAE rates among (1) those without pre-existing CVD, regardless of BP arm, nor among (2) those randomized to standard BP management, regardless of pre-existing CVD. Among higher risk patients with existing clinical CVD randomized to intensive BP management, a small but significant increase in overall SAE rate was found among those taking statin at baseline.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn SPRINT, generally statin use was not associated with increased risk of reporting SAEs. Only statin use by higher risk patients was associated with more overall SAEs. Confounding by clinical CVD and the polytherapy of intensive BP management may explain this.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31930338\">Title: Serious Adverse Events Cluster in Participants Experiencing the Primary Composite Cardiovascular Endpoint: A Post Hoc Analysis of the SPRINT Trial.\nAuthors: Botchway, Albert, Buhnerkempe, Michael G, Prakash, Vivek et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: American journal of hypertension\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIntensively treated participants in the SPRINT study experienced fewer primary cardiovascular composite study endpoints (CVD events) and lower mortality, although 38% of participants experienced a serious adverse event (SAE).

Separate benefit outcomes were the first occurrence of: 1) a CVD composite of acute myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or CVD death; and 2) all-cause mortality. Treatment-related AEs of interest included hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, and acute kidney injury. Modified elastic net Cox regression was used to predict absolute risk for each outcome and absolute risk differences on the basis of 36 baseline variables available at the point of care with intensive versus standard treatment.\nRESULTS\nAmong 8,828 SPRINT participants (mean age 67.9 years, 35% women), 600 CVD composite events, 363 all-cause deaths, and 481 treatment-related AEs occurred over a median follow-up period of 3.26 years. Individual participant risks were predicted for the CVD composite (C index = 0.71), all-cause mortality (C index = 0.75), and treatment-related AEs (C index = 0.69). Higher baseline CVD risk was associated with greater benefit (i.e., larger absolute CVD risk reduction). Predicted CVD benefit and predicted increased treatment-related AE risk were correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.72), and 95% of participants who fell into the highest tertile of predicted benefit also had high or moderate predicted increases in treatment-related AE risk. Few were predicted as high benefit with low AE risk (1.8%) or low benefit with high AE risk (1.5%). Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSPRINT participants with higher baseline predicted CVD risk gained greater absolute benefit from intensive treatment. Participants with high predicted benefit were also most likely to experience treatment-related AEs, but AEs were generally mild and transient. Patients should be prioritized for intensive SBP treatment on the basis of higher predicted benefit.

This study aimed to simulate the potential long-term impact of 4 hypertension management strategies in SPRINT-eligible US adults.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe validated Blood Pressure Control-Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a discrete event simulation of hypertension care processes (ie, visit frequency, blood pressure [BP] measurement accuracy, medication intensification, and medication adherence) and CVD outcomes, was populated with 25 000 SPRINT-eligible US adults. Four hypertension management strategies were simulated: (1) usual care targeting BP <140/90 mm Hg (Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure usual care), (2) intensive care per the SPRINT protocol targeting BP <120/90 mm Hg (SPRINT intensive), (3) usual care targeting guideline-recommended BP <130/80 mm Hg (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association usual care), and (4) team-based care added to usual care and targeting BP <130/80 mm Hg. Relative to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure usual care, among the 18.1 million SPRINT-eligible US adults, an estimated 138 100 total CVD events could be prevented per year with SPRINT intensive, 33 900 with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association usual care, and 89 100 with team-based care. Compared with the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure usual care, SPRINT intensive care was projected to increase treatment-related serious adverse events by 77 600 per year, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association usual care by 33 300, and team-based care by 27 200.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs BP control has declined in recent years, health systems must prioritize hypertension management and invest in effective strategies. Adding team-based care to usual care may be a pragmatic way to manage risk in this high-CVD-risk population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28373269\">Title: Personalizing the Intensity of Blood Pressure Control: Modeling the Heterogeneity of Risks and Benefits From SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial).\nAuthors: Patel, Krishna K, Arnold, Suzanne V, Chan, Paul S et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: Circulation. Cardiovascular quality and outcomes\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), patients with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk treated with intensive blood pressure (BP) control (<120 mm Hg) had fewer major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and deaths but higher rates of treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE) than patients randomized to standard BP control (<140 mm Hg). However, the degree of benefit or harm for an individual patient could vary because of heterogeneity in treatment effect.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nUsing patient-level data from 9361 randomized patients in SPRINT, we developed models to predict risk for MACE or death and treatment-related SAE to allow for individualized BP treatment goals based on each patient's projected risk and benefit of intensive versus standard BP control. Models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling and externally validated on 4741 patients from the ACCORD-BP (The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes blood pressure) trial. Among 9361 SPRINT patients, 755 patients (8.1%) had a MACE or death event and 338 patients (3.6%) had a treatment-related SAE during a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The MACE/death and the SAE model had C statistics of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively, in the derivation cohort and 0.69 and 0.65 in ACCORD. The MACE/death model had 10 variables including treatment interactions with age, baseline systolic BP, and diastolic BP, and the SAE model had 8 variables including treatment interaction with number of BP medications. Intensive BP treatment was associated with a mean 2.2±2.6% lower risk of MACE/death compared with standard treatment (range, 20.7% lower risk to 19.6% greater risk among individual patients) and a mean 2.2±1.2% higher risk for SAEs (range, 0.5%-15.8% more harm in individual patients).\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo translate the findings from SPRINT to clinical practice, we developed prediction models to tailor the intensity of BP control based on the projected risk and benefit for each unique patient. This approach should be prospectively tested to better engage patients in shared medical decision making and to improve outcomes.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\nURL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

However, the degree of benefit or harm for an individual patient could vary because of heterogeneity in treatment effect. \\n**Methods and results:** Using patient-level data from 9361 randomized patients in SPRINT, we developed models to predict risk for MACE or death and treatment-related SAE to allow for individualized BP treatment goals based on each patient's projected risk and benefit of intensive versus standard BP control. Models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling and externally validated on 4741 patients from the ACCORD-BP (The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes blood pressure) trial. Among 9361 SPRINT patients, 755 patients (8.1%) had a MACE or death event and 338 patients (3.6%) had a treatment-related SAE during a median follow-up of 3.3 years. The MACE/death and the SAE model had C statistics of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively, in the derivation cohort and 0.69 and 0.65 in ACCORD. The MACE/death model had 10 variables including treatment interactions with age, baseline systolic BP, and diastolic BP, and the SAE model had 8 variables including treatment interaction with number of BP medications. Intensive BP treatment was associated with a mean 2.2±2.6% lower risk of MACE/death compared with standard treatment (range, 20.7% lower risk to 19.6% greater risk among individual patients) and a me"}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:40:16.594848"}, {"tool_name": "google_search", "parameters": {}, "query": "PMID 28373269 treatment-related serious adverse events model variables", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"searchParameters\": {\"q\": \"PMID 28373269 treatment-related serious adverse events model variables\", \"gl\": \"us\", \"hl\": \"en\", \"type\": \"search\", \"num\": 10, \"engine\": \"google\"}, \"organic\": [{\"title\": \"Personalizing the Intensity of Blood Pressure Control ...\", \"link\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5428922/\", \"snippet\": \"by KK Patel · 2017 · Cited by 48 — Similarly, the outcome for SAE model was anti-hypertensive treatment-related serious adverse events.

The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.\nRESULTS\nFor this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported. In the primary analysis of the global phase II ELIANA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02435849), tisagenlecleucel provided an overall remission rate of 81% in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL), with 59% of responders remaining relapse-free at 12 months. Here, we report an update on efficacy, safety, and patient-reported quality of life in 79 pediatric and young adult patients with R/R B-ALL following a median follow-up of 38.8 months. The overall remission rate was 82%. The median event-free survival was 24 months, and the median overall survival was not reached. Event-free survival was 44% (95% CI, 31 to 57) and overall survival was 63% (95% CI, 51 to 73) at 3 years overall (most events occur within the first 2 years). The estimated 3-year relapse-free survival with and without censoring for subsequent therapy was 52% (95% CI, 37 to 66) and 48% (95% CI, 34 to 60), respectively. No new or unexpected long-term adverse events were reported. Grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 29% of patients > 1 year after infusion; grade 3/4 infection rate did not increase > 1 year after infusion. Patients reported improvements in quality of life up to 36 months after infusion. These findings demonstrate favorable long-term safety and suggest tisagenlecleucel as a curative treatment option for heavily pretreated pediatric and young adult patients with R/R B-ALL.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33335028\">Title: Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune effector cell-related adverse events.\nAuthors: Maus, Marcela V, Alexander, Sara, Bishop, Michael R et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Journal for immunotherapy of cancer\nAbstract: Immune effector cell (IEC) therapies offer durable and sustained remissions in significant numbers of patients with hematological cancers. While these unique immunotherapies have improved outcomes for pediatric and adult patients in a number of disease states, as 'living drugs,' their toxicity profiles, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), differ markedly from conventional cancer therapeutics. At the time of article preparation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel, all of which are IEC therapies based on genetically modified T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and additional products are expected to reach marketing authorization soon and to enter clinical development in due course. As IEC therapies, especially CAR T cell therapies, enter more widespread clinical use, there is a need for clear, cohesive recommendations on toxicity management, motivating the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) to convene an expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline. The panel discussed the recognition and management of common toxicities in the context of IEC treatment, including baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring, timing to onset, and pharmacological interventions, ultimately forming evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to assist medical professionals in decision-making and to improve outcomes for patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30111196\">Title: Tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nAuthors: Leahy, Allison Barz, Elgarten, Caitlin W, Grupp, Stephan A et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Expert review of anticancer therapy\nAbstract: Cure rates for pediatric and young adult patients with refractory or recurrently relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are dismal. Survival from time of relapse is typically measured in weeks to months, and standard chemotherapy and currently approved targeted therapy achieve remission in less than a third of affected patients. To date, the only definitive curative therapy has been allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Advances in immunotherapy, with the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and the development of tisagenlecleucel, have changed the landscape. Areas covered: This review will describe the pharmacology of tisagenlecleucel and summarize the clinical evidence for its use in the treatment of multiple-relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Also discussed are other immunotherapies for B-ALL as well as the most commonly-encountered toxicities and corresponding management strategies. Expert commentary: Early phase trials indicate that tisagenlecleucel significantly improves survival for patients with B-ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. In responding patients, remissions have been reported on the order of years, and thus, tisagenlecleucel may herald a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm of this largely fatal disease.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"34560014\">Title: CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for CNS relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukaemia: a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from five clinical trials.\nAuthors: Leahy, Allison Barz, Newman, Haley, Li, Yimei et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The Lancet. Haematology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCNS relapse of acute lymphocytic leukaemia is difficult to treat. Durable remissions of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have been observed following treatment with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; however, most trials have excluded patients with active CNS disease. We aimed to assess the safety and activity of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with a history of CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.\nMETHODS\nIn this post-hoc analysis, we included 195 patients (aged 1-29 years; 110 [56%] male and 85 [44%] female) with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma from five clinical trials (Pedi CART19, 13BT022, ENSIGN, ELIANA, and 16CT022) done at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA), in which participants received CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy between April 17, 2012, and April 16, 2019. The trials required control of CNS disease at enrolment and infusion and excluded treatment in the setting of acute neurological toxic effects (>grade 1 in severity) or parenchymal lesions deemed to increase the risk of neurotoxicity. 154 patients from Pedi CART19, ELIANA, ENSIGN, and 16CT022 received tisagenlecleucel and 41 patients from the 13BT022 trial received the humanised CD19-directed CAR, huCART19. We categorised patients into two strata on the basis of CNS status at relapse or within the 12 months preceding CAR T-cell infusion-either CNS-positive or CNS-negative disease. Patients with CNS-positive disease were further divided on the basis of morphological bone marrow involvement-either combined bone marrow and CNS involvement, or isolated CNS involvement. Endpoints were the proportion of patients with complete response at 28 days after infusion, Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival, and the incidence of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.\nFINDINGS\nOf all 195 patients, 66 (34%) were categorised as having CNS-positive disease and 129 (66%) as having CNS-negative disease, and 43 (22%) were categorised as having isolated CNS involvement. The median length of follow-up was 39 months (IQR 25-49) in the CNS-positive stratum and 36 months (18-49) in the CNS-negative stratum. The proportion of patients in the CNS-positive stratum with a complete response at 28 days after infusion was similar to that in the CNS-negative stratum (64 [97%] of 66 vs 121 [94%] of 129; p=0·74), with no significant difference in relapse-free survival (60% [95% CI 49-74] vs 60% [51-71]; p=0·50) or overall survival (83% [75-93] vs 71% [64-79]; p=0·39) at 2 years between the two groups. Overall survival at 2 years was significantly higher in patients with isolated CNS involvement compared with those with bone marrow involvement (91% [82-100] vs 71% [64-78]; p=0·046). The incidence and severity of neurotoxicity (any grade, 53 [41%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 1, 24 [19%] vs 20 [30%]; grade 2, 14 [11%] vs 10 [15%]; grade 3, 12 [9%] vs 6 [9%], and grade 4, 3 [2%] vs 2 [3%]; p=0·20) and cytokine release syndrome (any grade, 110 [85%] vs 53 [80%]; grade 1, 12 [9%] vs 2 [3%]; grade 2, 61 [47%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 3, 18 [14%] vs 7 [11%] and grade 4, 19 [15%] vs 6 [9%]; p=0·26) did not differ between the CNS-negative and the CNS-positive disease strata.\nINTERPRETATION\nTisagenlecleucel and huCART19 are active at clearing CNS disease and maintaining durable remissions in children and young adults with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma, without increasing the risk of severe neurotoxicity; although care should be taken in the timing of therapy and disease control to mitigate this risk. These preliminary findings support the use of these CAR T-cell therapies for patients with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.\nFUNDING\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia Frontier Program.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"browse_webpage\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28099811/</call_tool>\n<tool_output>Error: None</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">28099811 Maude ALL CAR</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 68 results.

Clinical oncology\nAbstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as a potent therapeutic approach for patients with certain haematological cancers, with multiple CAR T cell products currently approved by the FDA for those with relapsed and/or refractory B cell malignancies. However, in order to derive the desired level of effectiveness, patients need to successfully receive the CAR T cell infusion in a timely fashion. This process entails apheresis of the patient's T cells, followed by CAR T cell manufacture. While awaiting infusion at an authorized treatment centre, patients may receive interim disease-directed therapy. Most patients will also receive a course of pre-CAR T cell lymphodepletion, which has emerged as an important factor in enabling durable responses. The time between apheresis and CAR T cell infusion is often not a simple journey, with each milestone being a critical step that can have important downstream consequences for the ability to receive the infusion and the strength of clinical responses. In this Review, we provide a summary of the many considerations for preparing patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia for CAR T cell therapy, and outline current limitations and areas for future research.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35314843\">Title: PSMA-targeting TGFβ-insensitive armored CAR T cells in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a phase 1 trial.\nAuthors: Narayan, Vivek, Barber-Rotenberg, Julie S, Jung, In-Young et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nature medicine\nAbstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated promising efficacy, particularly in hematologic malignancies. One challenge regarding CAR T cells in solid tumors is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by high levels of multiple inhibitory factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. We report results from an in-human phase 1 trial of castration-resistant, prostate cancer-directed CAR T cells armored with a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor (NCT03089203). Primary endpoints were safety and feasibility, while secondary objectives included assessment of CAR T cell distribution, bioactivity and disease response. All prespecified endpoints were met. Eighteen patients enrolled, and 13 subjects received therapy across four dose levels. Five of the 13 patients developed grade ≥2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including one patient who experienced a marked clonal CAR T cell expansion, >98% reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and death following grade 4 CRS with concurrent sepsis. Acute increases in inflammatory cytokines correlated with manageable high-grade CRS events. Three additional patients achieved a PSA reduction of ≥30%, with CAR T cell failure accompanied by upregulation of multiple TME-localized inhibitory molecules following adoptive cell transfer. CAR T cell kinetics revealed expansion in blood and tumor trafficking. Thus, clinical application of TGF-β-resistant CAR T cells is feasible and generally safe. Future studies should use superior multipronged approaches against the TME to improve outcomes.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36399695\">Title: Three-Year Update of Tisagenlecleucel in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the ELIANA Trial.\nAuthors: Laetsch, Theodore W, Maude, Shannon L, Rives, Susana et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\nAbstract: Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported. In the primary analysis of the global phase II ELIANA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02435849), tisagenlecleucel provided an overall remission rate of 81% in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL), with 59% of responders remaining relapse-free at 12 months. Here, we report an update on efficacy, safety, and patient-reported quality of life in 79 pediatric and young adult patients with R/R B-ALL following a median follow-up of 38.8 months. The overall remission rate was 82%. The median event-free survival was 24 months, and the median overall survival was not reached. Event-free survival was 44% (95% CI, 31 to 57) and overall survival was 63% (95% CI, 51 to 73) at 3 years overall (most events occur within the first 2 years). The estimated 3-year relapse-free survival with and without censoring for subsequent therapy was 52% (95% CI, 37 to 66) and 48% (95% CI, 34 to 60), respectively. No new or unexpected long-term adverse events were reported. Grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 29% of patients > 1 year after infusion; grade 3/4 infection rate did not increase > 1 year after infusion. Patients reported improvements in quality of life up to 36 months after infusion. These findings demonstrate favorable long-term safety and suggest tisagenlecleucel as a curative treatment option for heavily pretreated pediatric and young adult patients with R/R B-ALL.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32001516\">Title: Impaired Death Receptor Signaling in Leukemia Causes Antigen-Independent Resistance by Inducing CAR T-cell Dysfunction.\nAuthors: Singh, Nathan, Lee, Yong Gu, Shestova, Olga et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Cancer discovery\nAbstract: Primary resistance to CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CART19) occurs in 10% to 20% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, the mechanisms of this resistance remain elusive. Using a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identified that impaired death receptor signaling in ALL led to rapidly progressive disease despite CART19 treatment. This was mediated by an inherent resistance to T-cell cytotoxicity that permitted antigen persistence and was subsequently magnified by the induction of CAR T-cell functional impairment. These findings were validated using samples from two CAR T-cell clinical trials in ALL, where we found that reduced expression of death receptor genes was associated with worse overall survival and reduced T-cell fitness. Our findings suggest that inherent dysregulation of death receptor signaling in ALL directly leads to CAR T-cell failure by impairing T-cell cytotoxicity and promoting progressive CAR T-cell dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Resistance to CART19 is a significant barrier to efficacy in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. This work demonstrates that impaired death receptor signaling in tumor cells causes failed CART19 cytotoxicity and drives CART19 dysfunction, identifying a novel mechanism of antigen-independent resistance to CAR therapy.

The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.\nRESULTS\nFor this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90% (95% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50% (95% CI, 35 to 64) and 76% (95% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77% of patients, 48% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this global study of CAR T-cell therapy, a single infusion of tisagenlecleucel provided durable remission with long-term persistence in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with transient high-grade toxic effects.

While these unique immunotherapies have improved outcomes for pediatric and adult patients in a number of disease states, as 'living drugs,' their toxicity profiles, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), differ markedly from conventional cancer therapeutics. At the time of article preparation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel, all of which are IEC therapies based on genetically modified T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and additional products are expected to reach marketing authorization soon and to enter clinical development in due course. As IEC therapies, especially CAR T cell therapies, enter more widespread clinical use, there is a need for clear, cohesive recommendations on toxicity management, motivating the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) to convene an expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline. The panel discussed the recognition and management of common toxicities in the context of IEC treatment, including baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring, timing to onset, and pharmacological interventions, ultimately forming evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to assist medical professionals in decision-making and to improve outcomes for patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35019853\">Title: Next-Generation Sequencing of Minimal Residual Disease for Predicting Relapse after Tisagenlecleucel in Children and Young Adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.\nAuthors: Pulsipher, Michael A, Han, Xia, Maude, Shannon L et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Blood cancer discovery\nAbstract: We assessed minimal residual disease (MRD) detection and B-cell aplasia after tisagenlecleucel therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to define biomarkers predictive of relapse ( N = 143). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) MRD detection >0 in bone marrow (BM) was highly associated with relapse. B-cell recovery [signifying loss of functional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells] within the first year of treatment was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for relapse of 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.03-9.97; P < 0.001]. Multivariate analysis at day 28 showed independent associations of BMNGS-MRD >0 (HR = 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18-10.8; P < 0.001) and B-cell recovery (HR = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44-7.69; P = 0.005) with relapse. By 3 months, the BMNGS-MRD HR increased to 12 (95% CI, 2.87-50; P < 0.001), whereas B-cell recovery was not independently predictive (HR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.33-4.79; P = 0.7). Relapses occurring with persistence of B-cell aplasia were largely CD19 - (23/25: 88%). Detectable BMNGS-MRD reliably predicts risk with sufficient time to consider approaches to relapse prevention such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or second CAR-T cell infusion. SIGNIFICANCE: Detectable disease by BMNGS-MRD with or without B-cell aplasia is highly predictive of relapse after tisagenlecleucel therapy for ALL. Clonotypic rearrangements used to follow NGS-MRD did not change after loss of CD19 or lineage switch. High-risk patients identified by these biomarkers may benefit from HCT or investigational cell therapies. See related commentary by Ghorashian and Bartram, p. 2 .

Durable remissions of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia have been observed following treatment with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; however, most trials have excluded patients with active CNS disease. We aimed to assess the safety and activity of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with a history of CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.\nMETHODS\nIn this post-hoc analysis, we included 195 patients (aged 1-29 years; 110 [56%] male and 85 [44%] female) with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma from five clinical trials (Pedi CART19, 13BT022, ENSIGN, ELIANA, and 16CT022) done at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA), in which participants received CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy between April 17, 2012, and April 16, 2019. The trials required control of CNS disease at enrolment and infusion and excluded treatment in the setting of acute neurological toxic effects (>grade 1 in severity) or parenchymal lesions deemed to increase the risk of neurotoxicity. 154 patients from Pedi CART19, ELIANA, ENSIGN, and 16CT022 received tisagenlecleucel and 41 patients from the 13BT022 trial received the humanised CD19-directed CAR, huCART19. We categorised patients into two strata on the basis of CNS status at relapse or within the 12 months preceding CAR T-cell infusion-either CNS-positive or CNS-negative disease. Patients with CNS-positive disease were further divided on the basis of morphological bone marrow involvement-either combined bone marrow and CNS involvement, or isolated CNS involvement. Endpoints were the proportion of patients with complete response at 28 days after infusion, Kaplan-Meier analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival, and the incidence of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity.\nFINDINGS\nOf all 195 patients, 66 (34%) were categorised as having CNS-positive disease and 129 (66%) as having CNS-negative disease, and 43 (22%) were categorised as having isolated CNS involvement. The median length of follow-up was 39 months (IQR 25-49) in the CNS-positive stratum and 36 months (18-49) in the CNS-negative stratum. The proportion of patients in the CNS-positive stratum with a complete response at 28 days after infusion was similar to that in the CNS-negative stratum (64 [97%] of 66 vs 121 [94%] of 129; p=0·74), with no significant difference in relapse-free survival (60% [95% CI 49-74] vs 60% [51-71]; p=0·50) or overall survival (83% [75-93] vs 71% [64-79]; p=0·39) at 2 years between the two groups. Overall survival at 2 years was significantly higher in patients with isolated CNS involvement compared with those with bone marrow involvement (91% [82-100] vs 71% [64-78]; p=0·046). The incidence and severity of neurotoxicity (any grade, 53 [41%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 1, 24 [19%] vs 20 [30%]; grade 2, 14 [11%] vs 10 [15%]; grade 3, 12 [9%] vs 6 [9%], and grade 4, 3 [2%] vs 2 [3%]; p=0·20) and cytokine release syndrome (any grade, 110 [85%] vs 53 [80%]; grade 1, 12 [9%] vs 2 [3%]; grade 2, 61 [47%] vs 38 [58%]; grade 3, 18 [14%] vs 7 [11%] and grade 4, 19 [15%] vs 6 [9%]; p=0·26) did not differ between the CNS-negative and the CNS-positive disease strata.\nINTERPRETATION\nTisagenlecleucel and huCART19 are active at clearing CNS disease and maintaining durable remissions in children and young adults with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma, without increasing the risk of severe neurotoxicity; although care should be taken in the timing of therapy and disease control to mitigate this risk. These preliminary findings support the use of these CAR T-cell therapies for patients with CNS relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia.\nFUNDING\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia Frontier Program.", "year": "2021", "venue": "The Lancet.

CFTR is a major prosecretory chloride channel at the ocular surface. We previously identified, by high-throughput screening, aminophenyl-1,3,5-triazine CFTRact-K089 (1) that activated CFTR with EC50 ≈ 250 nM, which when delivered topically increased tear fluid secretion in mice and showed efficacy in an experimental dry eye model. Here, functional analysis of aminophenyl-1,3,5-triazine analogs elucidated structure-activity relationships for CFTR activation and identified substantially more potent analogs than 1.

Single topical administration of 25 pmol of 12 increased tear volume in wild-type mice with sustained action for 8 h and was without effect in CFTR-deficient mice.

The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.\nRESULTS\nFor this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy.

However, in order to derive the desired level of effectiveness, patients need to successfully receive the CAR T cell infusion in a timely fashion. This process entails apheresis of the patient's T cells, followed by CAR T cell manufacture. While awaiting infusion at an authorized treatment centre, patients may receive interim disease-directed therapy. Most patients will also receive a course of pre-CAR T cell lymphodepletion, which has emerged as an important factor in enabling durable responses. The time between apheresis and CAR T cell infusion is often not a simple journey, with each milestone being a critical step that can have important downstream consequences for the ability to receive the infusion and the strength of clinical responses.

One challenge regarding CAR T cells in solid tumors is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by high levels of multiple inhibitory factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. We report results from an in-human phase 1 trial of castration-resistant, prostate cancer-directed CAR T cells armored with a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor (NCT03089203). Primary endpoints were safety and feasibility, while secondary objectives included assessment of CAR T cell distribution, bioactivity and disease response. All prespecified endpoints were met. Eighteen patients enrolled, and 13 subjects received therapy across four dose levels. Five of the 13 patients developed grade ≥2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including one patient who experienced a marked clonal CAR T cell expansion, >98% reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and death following grade 4 CRS with concurrent sepsis. Acute increases in inflammatory cytokines correlated with manageable high-grade CRS events. Three additional patients achieved a PSA reduction of ≥30%, with CAR T cell failure accompanied by upregulation of multiple TME-localized inhibitory molecules following adoptive cell transfer. CAR T cell kinetics revealed expansion in blood and tumor trafficking. Thus, clinical application of TGF-β-resistant CAR T cells is feasible and generally safe.

Using a genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we identified that impaired death receptor signaling in ALL led to rapidly progressive disease despite CART19 treatment. This was mediated by an inherent resistance to T-cell cytotoxicity that permitted antigen persistence and was subsequently magnified by the induction of CAR T-cell functional impairment. These findings were validated using samples from two CAR T-cell clinical trials in ALL, where we found that reduced expression of death receptor genes was associated with worse overall survival and reduced T-cell fitness. Our findings suggest that inherent dysregulation of death receptor signaling in ALL directly leads to CAR T-cell failure by impairing T-cell cytotoxicity and promoting progressive CAR T-cell dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Resistance to CART19 is a significant barrier to efficacy in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. This work demonstrates that impaired death receptor signaling in tumor cells causes failed CART19 cytotoxicity and drives CART19 dysfunction, identifying a novel mechanism of antigen-independent resistance to CAR therapy.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) MRD detection >0 in bone marrow (BM) was highly associated with relapse. B-cell recovery [signifying loss of functional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells] within the first year of treatment was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for relapse of 4.5 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.03-9.97; P < 0.001]. Multivariate analysis at day 28 showed independent associations of BMNGS-MRD >0 (HR = 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18-10.8; P < 0.001) and B-cell recovery (HR = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44-7.69; P = 0.005) with relapse.

Clonotypic rearrangements used to follow NGS-MRD did not change after loss of CD19 or lineage switch. High-risk patients identified by these biomarkers may benefit from HCT or investigational cell therapies. See related commentary by Ghorashian and Bartram, p. 2 .

A data-driven approach was proposed for categorical diagnosis prediction and timeline estimation of cognitive decline progression, which combined supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.\nRESULTS\nA reduced vector of only neuropsychological measures was selected for training the models. At baseline, this approach had high performance in detecting subjects at high risk of converting from MCI to dementia in the coming years. Furthermore, a Disease Progression Model (DPM) was built and also verified using three metrics. As a result of the DPM focused on the studied population, it was inferred that amyloid pathology (A+) appears about 7 years before dementia, and tau pathology (T+) and neurodegeneration (N+) occur almost simultaneously, between 3 and 4 years before dementia. In addition, MCI-A+ subjects were shown to progress more rapidly to dementia compared to MCI-A- subjects.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on proposed natural histories and cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of AD markers, the results indicated that only a single cerebrospinal fluid sample is necessary during the prodromal phase of AD. Prediction from MCI into dementia and its timeline can be achieved exclusively through neuropsychological measures.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37056479\">Title: Association of biological sex with clinical outcomes and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.\nAuthors: Iulita, M Florencia, Bejanin, Alexandre, Vilaplana, Eduard et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Brain communications\nAbstract: The study of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease is increasingly recognized as a key priority in research and clinical development. People with Down syndrome represent the largest population with a genetic link to Alzheimer's disease (>90% in the 7th decade). Yet, sex differences in Alzheimer's disease manifestations have not been fully investigated in these individuals, who are key candidates for preventive clinical trials. In this double-centre, cross-sectional study of 628 adults with Down syndrome [46% female, 44.4 (34.6; 50.7) years], we compared Alzheimer's disease prevalence, as well as cognitive outcomes and AT(N) biomarkers across age and sex. Participants were recruited from a population-based health plan in Barcelona, Spain, and from a convenience sample recruited via services for people with intellectual disabilities in England and Scotland. They underwent assessment with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome, modified cued recall test and determinations of brain amyloidosis (CSF amyloid-β 42 / 40 and amyloid-PET), tau pathology (CSF and plasma phosphorylated-tau181) and neurodegeneration biomarkers (CSF and plasma neurofilament light, total-tau, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and MRI). We used within-group locally estimated scatterplot smoothing models to compare the trajectory of biomarker changes with age in females versus males, as well as by apolipoprotein ɛ4 carriership. Our work revealed similar prevalence, age at diagnosis and Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome scores by sex, but males showed lower modified cued recall test scores from age 45 compared with females. AT(N) biomarkers were comparable in males and females. When considering apolipoprotein ɛ4, female ɛ4 carriers showed a 3-year earlier age at diagnosis compared with female non-carriers (50.5 versus 53.2 years, P = 0.01). This difference was not seen in males (52.2 versus 52.5 years, P = 0.76). Our exploratory analyses considering sex, apolipoprotein ɛ4 and biomarkers showed that female ɛ4 carriers tended to exhibit lower CSF amyloid-β 42/amyloid-β 40 ratios and lower hippocampal volume compared with females without this allele, in line with the clinical difference. This work showed that biological sex did not influence clinical and biomarker profiles of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome. Consideration of apolipoprotein ɛ4 haplotype, particularly in females, may be important for clinical research and clinical trials that consider this population. Accounting for, reporting and publishing sex-stratified data, even when no sex differences are found, is central to helping advance precision medicine.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36674881\">Title: The Synergic Effect of AT(N) Profiles and Depression on the Risk of Conversion to Dementia in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.\nAuthors: Marquié, Marta, García-Gutiérrez, Fernando, Orellana, Adelina et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: International journal of molecular sciences\nAbstract: Few studies have addressed the impact of the association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and NPSs in the conversion to dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and no studies have been conducted on the interaction effect of these two risk factors. AT(N) profiles were created using AD-core biomarkers quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (normal, brain amyloidosis, suspected non-Alzheimer pathology (SNAP) and prodromal AD). NPSs were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). A total of 500 individuals with MCI were followed-up yearly in a memory unit. Cox regression analysis was used to determine risk of conversion, considering additive and multiplicative interactions between AT(N) profile and NPSs on the conversion to dementia. A total of 224 participants (44.8%) converted to dementia during the 2-year follow-up study. Pathologic AT(N) groups (brain amyloidosis, prodromal AD and SNAP) and the presence of depression and apathy were associated with a higher risk of conversion to dementia. The additive combination of the AT(N) profile with depression exacerbates the risk of conversion to dementia. A synergic effect of prodromal AD profile with depressive symptoms is evidenced, identifying the most exposed individuals to conversion among MCI patients.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31399333\">Title: Frequency and longitudinal clinical outcomes of Alzheimer's AT(N) biomarker profiles: A longitudinal study.\nAuthors: Yu, Jin-Tai, Li, Jie-Qiong, Suckling, John et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nWe aimed to estimate the frequency of each AT(N) (β-amyloid deposition [A], pathologic tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) profile in different clinical diagnosis groups and to describe the longitudinal change in clinical outcomes of individuals in each group.\nMETHODS\nLongitudinal change in clinical outcomes and conversion risk of AT(N) profiles are assessed using linear mixed-effects models and multivariate Cox proportional-hazard models, respectively.\nRESULTS\nParticipants with A+T+N+ showed faster clinical progression than those with A-T-N- and A+T±N-. Compared with A-T-N-, participants with A+T+N± had an increased risk of conversion from cognitively normal (CN) to incident prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and from MCI to AD dementia. A+T+N+ showed an increased conversion risk when compared with A+T±N-.\nDISCUSSION\nThe 2018 research framework may provide prognostic information of clinical change and progression. It may also be useful for targeted recruitment of participants with AD into clinical trials.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33527855\">Title: The synaptic marker neurogranin as a disease state biomarker in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Wang, Zhibin, Yang, Jianwei, Zhu, Wei et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: The International journal of neuroscience\nAbstract: Objective: Synaptic degeneration is the pathologic foundation of cognitive decline in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. We aimed to determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) synaptic marker neurogranin (Ng) is a disease state or a disease stage biomarker in the AD continuum. Methods: Studies comparing CSF Ng levels among AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy participants were included. Studies were eligible if the correlation between CSF Ng levels and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores was investigated. Results: Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria ( n = 4515). The magnitude of effect sizes was more apparent in AD (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.22), than in MCI (SMD = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.29-1.34) compared to control populations. These results suggest that CSF Ng can discriminate AD and MCI from control populations, implying that synaptic degeneration worsens as patients progress from MCI to AD. However, there was a very weak correlation between CSF Ng levels and MMSE scores ( r = -0.15; 95% CI = -0.21--0.08) among the whole populations, suggesting that an increment of CSF Ng is best considered a biological evidence of disease state in the AD continuum. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that the synaptic marker CSF Ng can be used as a disease state biomarker for the AD continuum. Because synaptic degeneration is a distinct pathologic event from amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation, CSF Ng may provide an important supplementation to the AT(N) biomarker system to reveal the sequence of neuropathology.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">MCI due to Alzheimer biomarkers conversion</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 584 results.

MRI modalities show patterns of brain damage that discriminate AD from other brain illnesses and brain abnormalities that are associated with risk of conversion to AD from MCI and other behavioural outcomes. This review discusses the application of various MRI techniques to and their clinical usefulness in AD and MCI. MRI modalities covered include structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labelling (ASL), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI). There is much evidence supporting the validity of MRI as a biomarker for these disorders; however, only traditional structural imaging is currently recommended for routine use in clinical settings. Future research is needed to warrant the inclusion for more advanced MRI methodology in forthcoming revisions to diagnostic criteria for AD and MCI.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39684623\">Title: Role of Blood P-Tau Isoforms (181, 217, 231) in Predicting Conversion from MCI to Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease: A Review and Meta-Analysis.\nAuthors: Lombardi, Gemma, Pancani, Silvia, Manca, Riccardo et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: International journal of molecular sciences\nAbstract: Blood-based biomarkers are minimally invasive tools to detect the pathological changes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This meta-analysis aims to investigate the use of blood-derived p-tau isoforms (181, 217, 231) to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia (ADD). Studies involving MCI patients with data on blood p-tau isoforms at baseline and clinical diagnosis at follow-up (≥1 year) were included. Twelve studies on p-tau 181 (4340 MCI, conversion rate 20.6%), four on p-tau 217 (913 MCI, conversion rate 33.4%), and one on p-tau 231 (135 MCI, conversion rate 33%) were included. For p-tau 181, the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.73 (95% CI = 0.68-0.78), and for p-tau 217 was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.75-0.91). Plasma levels of p-tau 181 had good discriminatory power to identify MCI patients who will convert to ADD. Although only four studies on p-tau 217 have been included in the meta-analysis, in the last year the predictive power of p-tau 217 is emerging as superior to that of other isoforms. However, given the high heterogeneity detected in the p-tau 217 studies included in this meta-analysis, additional supportive evidence is needed. Insufficient results were available for p-tau 231. These findings support the prognostic utility of p-tau 181 and p-tau 217 measured in blood to predict progression to ADD in MCI and encourage its future implementation in clinical practice.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25914527\">Title: Mild cognitive impairment and its management in older people.\nAuthors: Eshkoor, Sima Ataollahi, Hamid, Tengku Aizan, Mun, Chan Yoke et al. | Year: 2015 | Journal: Clinical interventions in aging\nAbstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common condition in the elderly. It is characterized by deterioration of memory, attention, and cognitive function that is beyond what is expected based on age and educational level. MCI does not interfere significantly with individuals' daily activities. It can act as a transitional level of evolving dementia with a range of conversion of 10%-15% per year. Thus, it is crucial to protect older people against MCI and developing dementia. The preventive interventions and appropriate treatments should improve cognitive performance, and retard or prevent progressive deficits. The avoidance of toxins, reduction of stress, prevention of somatic diseases, implementation of mental and physical exercises, as well as the use of dietary compounds like antioxidants and supplements can be protective against MCI. The modification of risk factors such as stopping smoking, as well as the treatment of deficiency in vitamins and hormones by correcting behaviors and lifestyle, can prevent cognitive decline in the elderly. The progressive increase in the growth rate of the elderly population can enhance the rate of MCI all over the world. There is no exact cure for MCI and dementia; therefore, further studies are needed in the future to determine causes of MCI and risk factors of progression from MCI to dementia. This will help to find better ways for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment worldwide.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36519540\">Title: Soluble TREM2 levels associate with conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.\nAuthors: Zhao, Aonan, Jiao, Yang, Ye, Guanyu et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: The Journal of clinical investigation\nAbstract: BACKGROUNDSoluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) plays an important role in the clearance of pathological amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore sTREM2 as a central and peripheral predictor of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.METHODSsTREM2 and Aβ1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and florbetapir-PET (AV45) images were analyzed for healthy control (HCs), patients with MCI, and patients with AD from the ADNI database. Peripheral plasma sTREM2 and Aβ1-42 levels were determined for our Neurology database of Ruijin Hospital for Alzheimer's Disease (NRHAD) cohort, and patients with MCI were reevaluated at follow-up visits to assess for progression to AD. The association between CSF and plasma sTREM2 levels was analyzed in data from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and Lifestyle (CABLE) database.RESULTSThe results showed that patients with MCI who had low levels of CSF sTREM2 and Aβ1-42 were more likely to develop AD. Among participants with positive Aβ deposition, as assessed by AV45 imaging, elevated CSF sTREM2 levels were associated with a decreased risk of MCI-to-AD conversion. Meanwhile, in the NRHAD cohort, individuals in the MCI group with high sTREM2 levels in plasma were at a greater risk for AD, whereas low Aβ1-42 with high sTREM2 levels in plasma were associated with a faster cognitive decline. In addition, CSF sTREM2 levels were highly correlated with plasma sTREM2 levels in the CABLE database.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest that sTREM2 may be useful as a potential predictive biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion.FUNDINGThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 82001341, 82071415, 81873778, and 82201392); the Shanghai Sailing Program (grant no. 22YF1425100); and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (grant no. 2021M702169).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"36501136\">Title: Extra-Virgin Olive Oil Enhances the Blood-Brain Barrier Function in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\nAuthors: Kaddoumi, Amal, Denney, Thomas S, Deshpande, Gopikrishna et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Nutrients\nAbstract: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown leading to abnormal BBB permeability ahead of brain atrophy or dementia. Previous findings in AD mouse models have reported the beneficial effect of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) against AD, which improved BBB and memory functions and reduced brain amyloid-β (Aβ) and related pathology. This work aimed to translate these preclinical findings to humans in individuals with MCI. We examined the effect of daily consumption of refined olive oil (ROO) and EVOO for 6 months in MCI subjects on BBB permeability (assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI), and brain function (assessed using functional-MRI) as the primary outcomes. Cognitive function and AD blood biomarkers were also assessed as the secondary outcomes. Twenty-six participants with MCI were randomized with 25 participants completed the study. EVOO significantly improved clinical dementia rating (CDR) and behavioral scores. EVOO also reduced BBB permeability and enhanced functional connectivity. While ROO consumption did not alter BBB permeability or brain connectivity, it improved CDR scores and increased functional brain activation to a memory task in cortical regions involved in perception and cognition. Moreover, EVOO and ROO significantly reduced blood Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 and p-tau/t-tau ratios, suggesting that both altered the processing and clearance of Aβ. In conclusion, EVOO and ROO improved CDR and behavioral scores; only EVOO enhanced brain connectivity and reduced BBB permeability, suggesting EVOO biophenols contributed to such an effect. This proof-of-concept study justifies further clinical trials to assess olive oil's protective effects against AD and its potential role in preventing MCI conversion to AD and related dementias.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">ATN profiles MCI conversion ADNI</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 2 results.

We aimed to estimate the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories of SNAP individuals in non-demented elders and its comparison with individual in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology using 'AT(N)' system.\nMETHODS\nWe included individuals with available baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ (A), CSF phosphorylated tau examination (T) and 18F-uorodeoxyglucose PET or volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (N) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Longitudinal change in clinical outcomes are assessed using linear mixed effects models. Conversion risk from cognitively normal (CN) to cognitively impairment, and conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia are assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.\nRESULTS\nTotally, 366 SNAP individuals were included (114 A-T-N-, 154 A-T + N-, 54 A-T-N + and 44 A-T + N+) of whom 178 were CN and 188 were MCI. Compared with A-T-N-, CN elders with A-T + N-, A-T-N + and A-T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM score decline. Moreover, CN older individuals with A-T + N + also had a faster rate of decline in ADNI-MEM score than those with A-T + N- individuals. MCI patients with A-T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF decline and hippocampal volume loss compared with A-T-N- and A-T + N- profiles. CN older individuals with A-T + N + had an increased risk of conversion to cognitive impairment (CDR-GS ≥ 0.5) compared with A-T + N- and A-T-N-. In MCI patients, A-T + N + also had an increased risk of conversion to dementia compared with A-T + N- and A-T-N-. Compared with A-T + N-, CN elders and MCI patients with A + T + N- and A + T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-MEM score, ADNI-EF score decline, and hippocampal volume loss. CN individuals with A + T + N + had a faster rate of ADNI-EF score decline compare with A-T + N + individuals. Moreover, MCI patients with A + T + N + also had a faster rate of decline in ADNI-MEM score, ADNI-EF score and hippocampal volume loss than those with A-T + N + individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings from clinical, imaging and biomarker studies on SNAP, and its comparison with AD pathophysiology offered an important foundation for future studies.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32490138\">Title: Prognostic value of ATN Alzheimer biomarkers: 60-month follow-up results from the Argentine Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\nAuthors: Allegri, Ricardo F, Chrem Méndez, Patricio, Calandri, Ismael et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nAbstract: PURPOSE\nTo describe results of the Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration (ATN) research framework classification in the Argentine-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (arg-ADNI) cohort.\nMETHODS\nTwenty-three patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 12 dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), and 14 normal controls were studied following the ADNI2 protocol.

In this review, we aimed to assess the ability of CSF tau biomarkers (t-tau and p-tau) and the CSF tau (t-tau or p-tau)/ABeta ratio to enable the detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These biomarkers have been proposed as important in new criteria for Alzheimer's disease dementia that incorporate biomarker abnormalities.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the diagnostic accuracy of 1) CSF t-tau, 2) CSF p-tau, 3) the CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio and 4) the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio index tests for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.\nSEARCH METHODS\nThe most recent search for this review was performed in January 2013. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Thomson Reuters Web of Science), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We searched specialized sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews. We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for additional studies. We contacted researchers for possible relevant but unpublished data. We did not apply any language or data restriction to the electronic searches. We did not use any methodological filters as a method to restrict the search overall.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe selected those studies that had prospectively well-defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI and with CSF t-tau or p-tau and CSF tau (t-tau or p-tau)/ABeta ratio values, documented at or around the time the MCI diagnosis was made. We also included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and which contained sufficient data to construct two by two tables expressing those biomarker results by disease status. Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnosis, for example, the NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies, and the full papers for eligibility. Two independent assessors performed data extraction and quality assessment. Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nMAIN RESULTS\nIn total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data; 430 participants converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 130 participants to other forms of dementia. Follow-up ranged from less than one year to over four years for some participants, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years. Conversion to Alzheimer's disease dementia The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases).The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. At the median specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 75% (95% CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.47).Six studies (164 cases and 328 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100% while the specificities were between 22% and 86%. At the median specificity of 47.5%, the estimated sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 64 to 91), the positive likelihood ratio was 1.55 (CI 1.31 to 1.84), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.39 (CI: 0.19 to 0.82).Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio. The sensitivities were between 80% and 96% while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies were few and small. Only one study reported the accuracy of CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio.Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. A significant number of studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard, participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality.The accuracy of these CSF biomarkers for 'other dementias' had not been investigated in the included primary studies. Investigation of heterogeneity The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding).We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be included.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment, as opposed to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid. However, these tests may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Future studies with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32415550\">Title: CSF p-tau/Aβ 42 ratio and brain FDG-PET may reliably detect MCI \"imminent\" converters to AD.\nAuthors: Santangelo, Roberto, Masserini, Federico, Agosta, Federica et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging\nAbstract: PURPOSE\nTo know whether mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients will develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in very short time or remain stable is of crucial importance, also considering new experimental drugs usually tested within very short time frames. Here we combined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and a neurodegeneration marker such as brain FDG-PET to define an objective algorithm, suitable not only to reliably detect MCI converters to AD dementia but also to predict timing of conversion.\nMETHODS\nWe included 77 consecutive MCI patients with neurological/neuropsychological assessment, brain 18F-FDG-PET and CSF analysis available at diagnosis and a neuropsychological/neurological evaluation every 6 months for a medium- to a long-term follow-up (at least 2 and up to 8 years). Binomial logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to determine the best biomarker (or combination of biomarkers) in detecting MCI converters to AD dementia and then, among the converters, those who converted in short time frames.\nRESULTS\nThirty-five out of 77 MCI patients (45%) converted to AD dementia, with an average conversion time since MCI diagnosis of 26.07 months. CSF p-tau/Aβ42 was the most accurate predictor of conversion from MCI to AD dementia (82.9% sensitivity; 90% specificity). CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and FDG-PET-positive MCIs converted to AD dementia significantly earlier than the CSF-positive-only MCIs (median conversion time, 17.1 vs 31.3 months).\nCONCLUSIONS\nCSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio and brain FDG-PET may predict both occurrence and timing of MCI conversion to full-blown AD dementia. MCI patients with both biomarkers suggestive for AD will likely develop an AD dementia shortly, thus representing the ideal target for any new experimental drug requiring short periods to be tested for.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"38610055\">Title: Risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment or dementia among subjects with amyloid and tau pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAuthors: Huszár, Zsolt, Engh, Marie Anne, Pavlekovics, Márk et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Alzheimer's research & therapy\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nMeasurement of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels offers the potential for early detection of neurocognitive impairment. Still, the probability of developing a clinical syndrome in the presence of these protein changes (A+ and T+) remains unclear. By performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in the non-demented population with A+ and A- alone and in combination with T+ and T- as confirmed by PET or cerebrospinal fluid examination.\nMETHODS\nA systematic search of prospective and retrospective studies investigating the association of Aβ and p-tau with cognitive decline was performed in three databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL) on January 9, 2024. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane QUIPS tool. Odds ratios (OR) and Hazard Ratios (HR) were pooled using a random-effects model. The effect of neurodegeneration was not studied due to its non-specific nature.\nRESULTS\nA total of 18,162 records were found, and at the end of the selection process, data from 36 cohorts were pooled (n= 7,793). Compared to the unexposed group, the odds ratio (OR) for conversion to dementia in A+ MCI patients was 5.18 [95% CI 3.93; 6.81]. In A+ CU subjects, the OR for conversion to MCI or dementia was 5.79 [95% CI 2.88; 11.64]. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 or Aβ42/40 analysis and amyloid PET imaging showed consistent results. The OR for conversion in A+T+ MCI subjects (11.60 [95% CI 7.96; 16.91]) was significantly higher than in A+T- subjects (2.73 [95% CI 1.65; 4.52]). The OR for A-T+ MCI subjects was non-significant (1.47 [95% CI 0.55; 3.92]). CU subjects with A+T+ status had a significantly higher OR for conversion (13.46 [95% CI 3.69; 49.11]) than A+T- subjects (2.04 [95% CI 0.70; 5.97]). Meta-regression showed that the ORs for Aβ exposure decreased with age in MCI. (beta = -0.04 [95% CI -0.03 to -0.083]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIdentifying Aβ-positive individuals, irrespective of the measurement technique employed (CSF or PET), enables the detection of the most at-risk population before disease onset, or at least at a mild stage. The inclusion of tau status in addition to Aβ, especially in A+T+ cases, further refines the risk assessment. Notably, the higher odds ratio associated with Aβ decreases with age.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nThe study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021288100).</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"17886169\">Title: Do CSF total tau, phosphorylated tau, and beta-amyloid 42 help to predict progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease?

In view of the low specificity attained with the clinically based diagnostic criteria, including those for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), biomarker information will add precision to the incipient dementia diagnostic work-up, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). We present a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of the most relevant publications about the role of CSF biomarkers in the identification of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease at pre-dementia stages. A total of 16 studies were included in the systematic review, five of which were suitable for meta-analysis. We compared the standard mean differences (SMD) of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42), total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) for 130, 169 and 123 patients with MCI who converted to AD (MCI-AD) and 142, 157 and 130 controls, respectively. We conclude that when a clinical diagnosis of MCI is made at baseline assessment, low CSF levels of Abeta42 (SMD: -1.57, CI 95% [-2.30 to -0.84], P < 0.001), along with high T-tau (SMD: 1.52, CI 95% [1.25 to 1.79], P < 0.001), and high P-tau (SMD: 1.75, CI 95% [0.99 to 2.51], P < 0.001), help to predict the conversion to Alzheimer's disease as compared to controls subjects.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30927601\">Title: Association of short-term cognitive decline and MCI-to-AD dementia conversion with CSF, MRI, amyloid- and 18 F-FDG-PET imaging.\nAuthors: Ottoy, Julie, Niemantsverdriet, Ellis, Verhaeghe, Jeroen et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: NeuroImage. Clinical\nAbstract: Disease-modifying treatment trials are increasingly advanced to the prodromal or preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and inclusion criteria are based on biomarkers rather than clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is of great interest to determine which biomarkers should be combined to accurately predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia. However, up to date, only few studies performed a complete A/T/N subject characterization using each of the CSF and imaging markers, or they only investigated long-term (≥ 2 years) prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid- and 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) measures at baseline, in relation to cognitive changes and conversion to AD dementia over a short-term (12-month) period. We included 13 healthy controls, 49 MCI and 16 AD dementia patients with a clinical-based diagnosis and a complete A/T/N characterization at baseline. Global cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) burden was quantified using the 18 F-AV45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with two different reference regions (cerebellar grey and subcortical white matter), whereas metabolism was assessed based on 18 F-FDG SUVR. CSF measures included Aβ 1-42 , Aβ 1-40 , T-tau, P-tau 181 , and their ratios, and MRI markers included hippocampal volumes (HV), white matter hyperintensities, and cortical grey matter volumes. Cognitive functioning was measured by MMSE and RBANS index scores. All statistical analyses were corrected for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 genotype. As a result, faster cognitive decline was most strongly associated with hypometabolism (posterior cingulate) and smaller hippocampal volume (e.g., Δstory recall: β = +0.43 [p < 0.001] and + 0.37 [p = 0.005], resp.) at baseline. In addition, faster cognitive decline was significantly associated with higher baseline Aβ burden only if SUVR was referenced to the subcortical white matter (e.g., Δstory recall: β = -0.28 [p = 0.020]). Patients with MCI converted to AD dementia at an annual rate of 31%, which could be best predicted by combining neuropsychological testing (visuospatial construction skills) with either MRI-based HV or 18 F-FDG-PET. Combining all three markers resulted in 96% specificity and 92% sensitivity. Neither amyloid-PET nor CSF biomarkers could discriminate short-term converters from non-converters.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n### How the NIA-AA frameworks link biomarkers to better prognosis (conceptual evidence)\n**NIA-AA “MCI due to AD” (2011)** explicitly argues that clinical MCI is etiologically heterogeneous and that **adding AD biomarkers increases diagnostic certainty that the MCI syndrome is due to AD pathology**, which should in turn improve prediction of progression to AD dementia.

Studies were eligible if the correlation between CSF Ng levels and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores was investigated. Results: Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria ( n = 4515). The magnitude of effect sizes was more apparent in AD (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-2.22), than in MCI (SMD = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.29-1.34) compared to control populations.

We contacted researchers for possible relevant but unpublished data. We did not apply any language or data restriction to the electronic searches. We did not use any methodological filters as a method to restrict the search overall.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe selected those studies that had prospectively well-defined cohorts with any accepted definition of MCI and with CSF t-tau or p-tau and CSF tau (t-tau or p-tau)/ABeta ratio values, documented at or around the time the MCI diagnosis was made. We also included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and which contained sufficient data to construct two by two tables expressing those biomarker results by disease status. Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's disease dementia diagnosis, for example, the NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies, and the full papers for eligibility. Two independent assessors performed data extraction and quality assessment. Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nMAIN RESULTS\nIn total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data; 430 participants converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 130 participants to other forms of dementia. Follow-up ranged from less than one year to over four years for some participants, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years. Conversion to Alzheimer's disease dementia The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases).The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. At the median specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 75% (95% CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.47).Six studies (164 cases and 328 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100% while the specificities were between 22% and 86%. At the median specificity of 47.5%, the estimated sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 64 to 91), the positive likelihood ratio was 1.55 (CI 1.31 to 1.84), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.39 (CI: 0.19 to 0.82).Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio. The sensitivities were between 80% and 96% while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies were few and small. Only one study reported the accuracy of CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio.Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. A significant number of studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard, participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality.The accuracy of these CSF biomarkers for 'other dementias' had not been investigated in the included primary studies. Investigation of heterogeneity The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding).We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be included.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment, as opposed to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid. However, these tests may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Future studies with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified.", "year": "2017", "venue": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"}, {"paperId": "32415550", "title": "CSF p-tau/Aβ 42 ratio and brain FDG-PET may reliably detect MCI \"imminent\" converters to AD.", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo know whether mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients will develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in very short time or remain stable is of crucial importance, also considering new experimental drugs usually tested within very short time frames. Here we combined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers and a neurodegeneration marker such as brain FDG-PET to define an objective algorithm, suitable not only to reliably detect MCI converters to AD dementia but also to predict timing of conversion.\nMETHODS\nWe included 77 consecutive MCI patients with neurological/neuropsychological assessment, brain 18F-FDG-PET and CSF analysis available at diagnosis and a neuropsychological/neurological evaluation every 6 months for a medium- to a long-term follow-up (at least 2 and up to 8 years). Binomial logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to determine the best biomarker (or combination of biomarkers) in detecting MCI converters to AD dementia and then, among the converters, those who converted in short time frames.\nRESULTS\nThirty-five out of 77 MCI patients (45%) converted to AD dementia, with an average conversion time since MCI diagnosis of 26.07 months. CSF p-tau/Aβ42 was the most accurate predictor of conversion from MCI to AD dementia (82.9% sensitivity; 90% specificity). CSF p-tau/Aβ42 and FDG-PET-positive MCIs converted to AD dementia significantly earlier than the CSF-positive-only MCIs (median conversion time, 17.1 vs 31.3 months).\nCONCLUSIONS\nCSF p-tau/Aβ42 ratio and brain FDG-PET may predict both occurrence and timing of MCI conversion to full-blown AD dementia.

Still, the probability of developing a clinical syndrome in the presence of these protein changes (A+ and T+) remains unclear. By performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in the non-demented population with A+ and A- alone and in combination with T+ and T- as confirmed by PET or cerebrospinal fluid examination.\nMETHODS\nA systematic search of prospective and retrospective studies investigating the association of Aβ and p-tau with cognitive decline was performed in three databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL) on January 9, 2024. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane QUIPS tool. Odds ratios (OR) and Hazard Ratios (HR) were pooled using a random-effects model. The effect of neurodegeneration was not studied due to its non-specific nature.\nRESULTS\nA total of 18,162 records were found, and at the end of the selection process, data from 36 cohorts were pooled (n= 7,793). Compared to the unexposed group, the odds ratio (OR) for conversion to dementia in A+ MCI patients was 5.18 [95% CI 3.93; 6.81]. In A+ CU subjects, the OR for conversion to MCI or dementia was 5.79 [95% CI 2.88; 11.64]. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 or Aβ42/40 analysis and amyloid PET imaging showed consistent results. The OR for conversion in A+T+ MCI subjects (11.60 [95% CI 7.96; 16.91]) was significantly higher than in A+T- subjects (2.73 [95% CI 1.65; 4.52]). The OR for A-T+ MCI subjects was non-significant (1.47 [95% CI 0.55; 3.92]). CU subjects with A+T+ status had a significantly higher OR for conversion (13.46 [95% CI 3.69; 49.11]) than A+T- subjects (2.04 [95% CI 0.70; 5.97]). Meta-regression showed that the ORs for Aβ exposure decreased with age in MCI.

The inclusion of tau status in addition to Aβ, especially in A+T+ cases, further refines the risk assessment.

In view of the low specificity attained with the clinically based diagnostic criteria, including those for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), biomarker information will add precision to the incipient dementia diagnostic work-up, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). We present a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of the most relevant publications about the role of CSF biomarkers in the identification of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease at pre-dementia stages.

Therefore, it is of great interest to determine which biomarkers should be combined to accurately predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia. However, up to date, only few studies performed a complete A/T/N subject characterization using each of the CSF and imaging markers, or they only investigated long-term (≥ 2 years) prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid- and 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) measures at baseline, in relation to cognitive changes and conversion to AD dementia over a short-term (12-month) period. We included 13 healthy controls, 49 MCI and 16 AD dementia patients with a clinical-based diagnosis and a complete A/T/N characterization at baseline. Global cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) burden was quantified using the 18 F-AV45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with two different reference regions (cerebellar grey and subcortical white matter), whereas metabolism was assessed based on 18 F-FDG SUVR. CSF measures included Aβ 1-42 , Aβ 1-40 , T-tau, P-tau 181 , and their ratios, and MRI markers included hippocampal volumes (HV), white matter hyperintensities, and cortical grey matter volumes. Cognitive functioning was measured by MMSE and RBANS index scores. All statistical analyses were corrected for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 genotype. As a result, faster cognitive decline was most strongly associated with hypometabolism (posterior cingulate) and smaller hippocampal volume (e.g., Δstory recall: β = +0.43 [p < 0.001] and + 0.37 [p = 0.005], resp.) at baseline. In addition, faster cognitive decline was significantly associated with higher baseline Aβ burden only if SUVR was referenced to the subcortical white matter (e.g., Δstory recall: β = -0.28 [p = 0.020]). Patients with MCI converted to AD dementia at an annual rate of 31%, which could be best predicted by combining neuropsychological testing (visuospatial construction skills) with either MRI-based HV or 18 F-FDG-PET.

Here, we assessed outcomes in ZUMA-1 after 5 years of follow-up. Eligible adults received lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by axi-cel (2 × 106 cells per kg). Investigator-assessed response, survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics were assessed in patients who had received treatment. The objective response rate in these 101 patients was 83% (58% complete response rate); with a median follow-up of 63.1 months, responses were ongoing in 31% of patients at data cutoff. Median overall survival (OS) was 25.8 months, and the estimated 5-year OS rate was 42.6%. Disease-specific survival (excluding deaths unrelated to disease progression) estimated at 5 years was 51.0%. No new serious adverse events or deaths related to axi-cel were observed after additional follow-up. Peripheral blood B cells were detectable in all evaluable patients at 3 years with polyclonal B-cell recovery in 91% of patients. Ongoing responses at 60 months were associated with early CAR T-cell expansion. In conclusion, this 5-year follow-up analysis of ZUMA-1 demonstrates sustained overall and disease-specific survival, with no new safety signals in patients with refractory LBCL. Protracted B-cell aplasia was not required for durable responses. These findings support the curative potential of axi-cel in a subset of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas.

Oncology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nAxicabtagene ciloleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. In the previous analysis of the ZUMA-1 registrational study, with a median follow-up of 15·4 months (IQR 13·7-17·3), 89 (82%) of 108 assessable patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved an objective response, and complete responses were noted in 63 (58%) patients. Here we report long-term activity and safety outcomes of the ZUMA-1 study.\nMETHODS\nZUMA-1 is a single-arm, multicentre, registrational trial at 22 sites in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma-including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma-according to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2 × 10 6 CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 body-surface area) on days -5, -4, and -3. The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02348216. Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway.\nFINDINGS\nBetween May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27·1 months (IQR 25·7-28·8), 84 (83%) had an objective response, and 59 (58%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11·1 months (4·2-not estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12·8-not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 3·3-15·0). 52 (48%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events in 35 (32%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.\nFUNDING\nKite and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Therapy Acceleration Program.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29226797\">Title: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel CAR T-Cell Therapy in Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma.\nAuthors: Neelapu, Sattva S, Locke, Frederick L, Bartlett, Nancy L et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn a phase 1 trial, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, showed efficacy in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma after the failure of conventional therapy.\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled 111 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or transformed follicular lymphoma who had refractory disease despite undergoing recommended prior therapy. Patients received a target dose of 2×10 6 anti-CD19 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight after receiving a conditioning regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The primary end point was the rate of objective response (calculated as the combined rates of complete response and partial response). Secondary end points included overall survival, safety, and biomarker assessments.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 111 patients who were enrolled, axi-cel was successfully manufactured for 110 (99%) and administered to 101 (91%). The objective response rate was 82%, and the complete response rate was 54%.With a median follow-up of 15.4 months, 42% of the patients continued to have a response, with 40% continuing to have a complete response. The overall rate of survival at 18 months was 52%. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher during treatment were neutropenia (in 78% of the patients), anemia (in 43%), and thrombocytopenia (in 38%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 13% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Three of the patients died during treatment. Higher CAR T-cell levels in blood were associated with response.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this multicenter study, patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma who received CAR T-cell therapy with axi-cel had high levels of durable response, with a safety profile that included myelosuppression, the cytokine release syndrome, and neurologic events.

In 2017, axicabtagene ciloleucel and soon after tisagenlecleucel became the first approved CAR-T cell products for patients with high-grade B-cell lymphomas or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are relapsed or refractory to ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy; lisocabtagene maraleucel was approved in 2021. Safety and efficacy outcomes from the pivotal trials of each CAR-T cell therapy have been reported. Despite addressing a common unmet need in the large B-cell lymphoma population and utilizing similar CAR technologies, there are differences between CAR-T cell products in manufacturing, pivotal clinical trial designs, and data reporting. Early reports of commercial use of axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel provide the first opportunities to validate the impact of patient characteristics on the efficacy and safety of these CAR-T cell therapies in the real world. Going forward, caring for patients after CAR-T cell therapy will require strategies to monitor patients for sustained responses and potential long-term side effects.

Patients receiving axi-cel in the real world could have broader a demographic, disease, and treatment profile compared with that of the cohort in the pivotal ZUMA-1 trial. The present study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of axi-cel therapy in the real-world setting. A total of 1297 patients receiving commercial axi-cel between 2017 and 2020 were selected from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research's data registry, of whom 739 (57%) would have been ineligible for inclusion in the ZUMA-1 cohort. Efficacy and safety outcomes were described for the entire cohort and by ZUMA-1 eligibility. Their associations with age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score, and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariable logistic and Cox regressions. At a median follow-up of 12.9 months, the overall response rate (ORR) was 73%, with a 56% complete response (CR) rate. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 21.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.4 to 28.8 months) and 8.6 months (95% CI, 6.5 to 12.1 months), respectively. Duration of response (DOR) was comparable in the ZUMA-1 ineligible patients and ZUMA-1 eligible patients (62% by 1 year [95% CI, 57% to 66%] versus 67% [95% CI, 62% to 72%]). Patients age ≥65 years had favorable ORR (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.83) despite having a higher risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.94) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.39-2.26). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score ≥2 was associated with inferior efficacy outcomes (OR for ORR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.56; hazard ratio [HR] for OS, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.37 to 4.52) and higher incidence of ICANS (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.93). The patients ineligible for ZUMA-1 still had a durable response with axi-cel. Elderly patients had favorable efficacy outcomes despite higher rates of CRS and ICANS. Patient selection for standard-of-care axi-cel should consider comorbidities and risk-to-benefit ratio rather than be based strictly on ZUMA-1 eligibility.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\nIn ZUMA-1 (axi-cel for refractory large B-cell lymphoma), the reported outcomes were:\n\n- **Objective response rate (ORR): 82%**\n- **Grade ≥3 neurotoxicity (neurologic events): 28%** <cite id=\"29226797\">Neelapu SS et al., ZUMA-1 phase 2 (NEJM 2017): ORR 82%; grade ≥3 neurologic events 28%.</cite>\n</answer>", "tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29226797/", "result": {"truncated": true, "preview": "{\"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29226797/\", \"success\": true, \"markdown\": \"#  Axicabtagene Ciloleucel CAR T-Cell Therapy in Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma \\nN Engl J Med. 2017 Dec 28;377(26):2531-2544. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1707447.

In the previous analysis of the ZUMA-1 registrational study, with a median follow-up of 15·4 months (IQR 13·7-17·3), 89 (82%) of 108 assessable patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved an objective response, and complete responses were noted in 63 (58%) patients. Here we report long-term activity and safety outcomes of the ZUMA-1 study.\nMETHODS\nZUMA-1 is a single-arm, multicentre, registrational trial at 22 sites in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma-including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma-according to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2 × 10 6 CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2 body-surface area) on days -5, -4, and -3. The primary endpoints were safety for phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase 2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02348216. Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway.\nFINDINGS\nBetween May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27·1 months (IQR 25·7-28·8), 84 (83%) had an objective response, and 59 (58%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11·1 months (4·2-not estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12·8-not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 3·3-15·0). 52 (48%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events in 35 (32%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up.\nINTERPRETATION\nThese 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.\nFUNDING\nKite and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Therapy Acceleration Program.", "year": "2019", "venue": "The Lancet.

Patients received a target dose of 2×10 6 anti-CD19 CAR T cells per kilogram of body weight after receiving a conditioning regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. The primary end point was the rate of objective response (calculated as the combined rates of complete response and partial response). Secondary end points included overall survival, safety, and biomarker assessments.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 111 patients who were enrolled, axi-cel was successfully manufactured for 110 (99%) and administered to 101 (91%). The objective response rate was 82%, and the complete response rate was 54%.With a median follow-up of 15.4 months, 42% of the patients continued to have a response, with 40% continuing to have a complete response. The overall rate of survival at 18 months was 52%. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher during treatment were neutropenia (in 78% of the patients), anemia (in 43%), and thrombocytopenia (in 38%). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome and neurologic events occurred in 13% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Three of the patients died during treatment.

Different HYAFF11 sponges having different pore sizes, coated or not coated with HA, have been studied from a rheological and morphological point of view in order to correlate their structure to the macroscopic and degradation properties both in vitro and in vivo, using rat model. The in vitro results indicate that the HYAFF11 sponges possess proper structural and mechanical properties to be used as scaffolds for adipose tissue engineering and, among all the analysed samples, uncoated HYAFF11 large-pore sponges showed a longer lasting mechanical stability. From the in vivo results, it was observed that the elastic modulus of scaffolds seeded with preadipocytes, the biohybrid constructs, and explanted after 3 months of implantation in autologous rat model are over one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding values for the native tissue. These results could suggest that the implanted scaffolds can be invaded and populated by different cells, not only adipocytes, that can produce new matrix having different properties from that of adipose tissue.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">18035408</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 1 results.

We previously reported generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, capable of germline transmission, from mouse somatic cells by transduction of four defined transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\nI cannot make the requested “factor set” comparison using the two PMIDs you provided, because **PMID: 17602736 is not an iPSC reprogramming paper**.

From the in vivo results, it was observed that the elastic modulus of scaffolds seeded with preadipocytes, the biohybrid constructs, and explanted after 3 months of implantation in autologous rat model are over one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding values for the native tissue. These results could suggest that the implanted scaffolds can be invaded and populated by different cells, not only adipocytes, that can produce new matrix having different properties from that of adipose tissue. \n##  Publication types \n  * Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't \n\n\n##  MeSH terms \n  * Adipocytes / cytology* \n  * Adipocytes / metabolism \n  * Adipocytes / transplantation \n  * Animals \n  * Biodegradation, Environmental \n  * Cell Adhesion \n  * Cell Culture Techniques \n  * Cells, Cultured \n  * Coated Materials, Biocompatible / chemistry* \n  * Elasticity \n  * Hyaluronic Acid / analogs & derivatives \n  * Hyaluronic Acid / chemistry* \n  * Implants, Experimental \n  * Materials Testing \n  * Microscopy, Electron, Scanning \n  * Porosity \n  * Rats \n  * Rheology \n  * Time Factors \n  * Tissue Engineering / methods* \n  * Transplantation, Homologous \n\n\n##  Substances \n  * Coated Materials, Biocompatible \n  * Hyaluronic Acid \n\n\n", "fit_markdown": "", "html": null, "error": null}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:42:43.402484"}, {"tool_name": "browse_webpage", "parameters": {}, "query": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17602736", "result": {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17602736", "success": true, "markdown": "#  Structural and rheological characterization of hyaluronic acid-based scaffolds for adipose tissue engineering \nBiomaterials. 2007 Oct;28(30):4399-408. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.06.007.

Neurology\nAbstract: The discovery that repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are a frequent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has revolutionized our understanding of these diseases. Substantial headway has been made in characterizing C9orf72-mediated disease and unravelling its underlying aetiopathogenesis. Three main disease mechanisms have been proposed: loss of function of the C9orf72 protein and toxic gain of function from C9orf72 repeat RNA or from dipeptide repeat proteins produced by repeat-associated non-ATG translation. Several downstream processes across a range of cellular functions have also been implicated. In this article, we review the pathological and mechanistic features of C9orf72-associated FTD and ALS (collectively termed C9FTD/ALS), the model systems used to study these conditions, and the probable initiators of downstream disease mechanisms. We suggest that a combination of upstream mechanisms involving both loss and gain of function and downstream cellular pathways involving both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects contributes to disease progression.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"21944778\">Title: Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in noncoding region of C9ORF72 causes chromosome 9p-linked FTD and ALS.\nAuthors: DeJesus-Hernandez, Mariely, Mackenzie, Ian R, Boeve, Bradley F et al. | Year: 2011 | Journal: Neuron\nAbstract: Several families have been reported with autosomal-dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), genetically linked to chromosome 9p21. Here, we report an expansion of a noncoding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 that is strongly associated with disease in a large FTD/ALS kindred, previously reported to be conclusively linked to chromosome 9p. This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7%) and familial ALS (23.5%). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"27830784\">Title: Decoding ALS: from genes to mechanism.\nAuthors: Taylor, J Paul, Brown, Robert H, Cleveland, Don W | Year: 2016 | Journal: Nature\nAbstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease.

Dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins translated from both sense and antisense repeats, especially arginine-rich DPRs (R-DPRs), contribute to neurodegeneration. Through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening in human-derived neurons, we identified receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase S (PTPσ) as a strong modifier of poly-GR-mediated toxicity. We showed that reducing PTPσ promotes the survival of both poly-GR- and poly-PR-expressing neurons by elevating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), accompanied by restored early endosomes and lysosomes. Remarkably, PTPσ knockdown or inhibition substantially rescues the PI3P-endolysosomal defects and improves the survival of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons. Furthermore, the PTPσ inhibitor diminishes GR toxicity and rescues pathological and behavioral phenotypes in mice. Overall, these findings emphasize the critical role of PI3P-mediated endolysosomal deficits induced by R-DPRs in disease pathogenesis and reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPσ in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">21944780 C9ORF72 ALS</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 2028 results.

We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24819148\">Title: Hippocampal sclerosis dementia with the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion.\nAuthors: Pletnikova, Olga, Sloane, Kelly L, Renton, Alan E et al. | Year: 2014 | Journal: Neurobiology of aging\nAbstract: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the main syndromes of the chromosome 9 ORF72 (C9ORF72) hexanucleotide repeat expansion, but studies have shown a substantial phenotypic diversity that includes psychiatric presentations. This study describes hippocampal sclerosis dementia (HSD) in carriers of the C9ORF72 mutation. We compared clinical and neuropathological features of HSD in carriers and noncarriers autopsied at Johns Hopkins. Carriers presented with amnesia, agitation, dissocial behavior, and impaired self-care, whereas noncarriers showed little agitation. The groups were not dissimilar in cognitive or motor dysfunction. Neuropathological examination of carriers showed cerebellar neuronal inclusions positive for ubiquitin, p62, and ubiquilin-2, and negative for TAR DNA-binding protein 43. Noncarriers did not have cerebellar inclusions. C9ORF72 repeat-associated non-ATG translation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These observations broaden the C9ORF72 phenotype and place HSD in the FTD spectrum. The amnesic phenotype of HSD, which is consistent with the focal hippocampal atrophy, should be included in clinical categorizations of FTD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"30979436\">Title: C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat length in older population: normal variation and effects on cognition.\nAuthors: Kaivola, Karri, Kiviharju, Anna, Jansson, Lilja et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Neurobiology of aging\nAbstract: The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 is a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia and also rarely found in other psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. Alleles with >30 repeats are often considered an expansion, but the pathogenic repeat length threshold is still unclear. It is also unclear whether intermediate repeat length alleles (often defined either as 7-30 or 20-30 repeats) have clinically significant effects. We determined the C9orf72 repeat length distribution in 3142 older Finns (aged 60-104 years). The longest nonexpanded allele was 45 repeats. We found 7-45 repeats in 1036/3142 (33%) individuals, 20-45 repeats in 56/3142 (1.8%), 30-45 repeats in 12/3142 (0.38%), and expansion (>45 repeats) in 6/3142 (0.19%). There was no apparent clustering of neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases in individuals with 30-45 repeats indicating that 30-45 repeats are not pathogenic. None of the 6 expansion carriers had a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia but 4 had a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative or psychiatric disease. Intermediate length alleles (categorized as 7-45 and 20-45 repeats) did not associate with Alzheimer's disease or cognitive impairment.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"22406228\">Title: Frequency of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia: a cross-sectional study.\nAuthors: Majounie, Elisa, Renton, Alan E, Mok, Kin et al. | Year: 2012 | Journal: The Lancet. Neurology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nWe aimed to accurately estimate the frequency of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 that has been associated with a large proportion of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\nMETHODS\nWe screened 4448 patients diagnosed with ALS (El Escorial criteria) and 1425 patients with FTD (Lund-Manchester criteria) from 17 regions worldwide for the GGGGCC hexanucleotide expansion using a repeat-primed PCR assay. We assessed familial disease status on the basis of self-reported family history of similar neurodegenerative diseases at the time of sample collection. We compared haplotype data for 262 patients carrying the expansion with the known Finnish founder risk haplotype across the chromosomal locus. We calculated age-related penetrance using the Kaplan-Meier method with data for 603 individuals with the expansion.\nFINDINGS\nIn patients with sporadic ALS, we identified the repeat expansion in 236 (7·0%) of 3377 white individuals from the USA, Europe, and Australia, two (4·1%) of 49 black individuals from the USA, and six (8·3%) of 72 Hispanic individuals from the USA. The mutation was present in 217 (39·3%) of 552 white individuals with familial ALS from Europe and the USA. 59 (6·0%) of 981 white Europeans with sporadic FTD had the mutation, as did 99 (24·8%) of 400 white Europeans with familial FTD. Data for other ethnic groups were sparse, but we identified one Asian patient with familial ALS (from 20 assessed) and two with familial FTD (from three assessed) who carried the mutation.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,873 patients diagnosed with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive myasthenia gravis and 36,370 healthy individuals to identify disease-associated genetic risk loci. Replication of the discovered loci was attempted in an independent cohort from the UK Biobank. We also performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using expression data from skeletal muscle, whole blood, and tibial nerve to test the effects of disease-associated polymorphisms on gene expression. We discovered two signals in the genes encoding acetylcholine receptor subunits that are the most common antigenic target of the autoantibodies: a GWAS signal within the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit ( CHRNA1 ) gene and a TWAS association with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 1 subunit ( CHRNB1 ) gene in normal skeletal muscle. Two other loci were discovered on 10p14 and 11q21, and the previous association signals at PTPN22 , HLA-DQA1/HLA-B , and TNFRSF11A were confirmed. Subgroup analyses demonstrate that early- and late-onset cases have different genetic risk factors. Genetic correlation analysis confirmed a genetic link between myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. Finally, we applied Priority Index analysis to identify potentially druggable genes/proteins and pathways. This study provides insight into the genetic architecture underlying myasthenia gravis and demonstrates that genetic factors within the loci encoding acetylcholine receptor subunits contribute to its pathogenesis.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n## Original discovery studies (Neuron, 2011)\n\n### Renton et al.

We discovered two signals in the genes encoding acetylcholine receptor subunits that are the most common antigenic target of the autoantibodies: a GWAS signal within the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit ( CHRNA1 ) gene and a TWAS association with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 1 subunit ( CHRNB1 ) gene in normal skeletal muscle. Two other loci were discovered on 10p14 and 11q21, and the previous association signals at PTPN22 , HLA-DQA1/HLA-B , and TNFRSF11A were confirmed. Subgroup analyses demonstrate that early- and late-onset cases have different genetic risk factors. Genetic correlation analysis confirmed a genetic link between myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. Finally, we applied Priority Index analysis to identify potentially druggable genes/proteins and pathways. This study provides insight into the genetic architecture underlying myasthenia gravis and demonstrates that genetic factors within the loci encoding acetylcholine receptor subunits contribute to its pathogenesis.", "year": "2022", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}]}, "timestamp": "2025-12-16T16:44:33.956275"}], "final_answer": "## Original discovery studies (Neuron, 2011)\n\n### Renton et al.

Tocilizumab--an inhibitor of interleukin 6 receptor signalling--has been studied as monotherapy in several clinical trials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab monotherapy compared with adalimumab monotherapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nMETHODS\nWe did this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 4 superiority study in 76 centres in 15 countries in North and South America, Australasia, and Europe. We enrolled patients who were aged at least 18 years, had severe rheumatoid arthritis for 6 months or more, and were intolerant to methotrexate or were inappropriate for continued methotrexate treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; block size of four) to receive tocilizumab 8 mg per kg bodyweight intravenously every 4 weeks plus placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks plus placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Investigators, patients, and sponsor personnel were masked to assignment. The primary endpoint was change in disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28) from baseline to week 24. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01119859.\nFINDINGS\nWe screened 452 patients and enrolled 326 patients. The intention-to-treat population contained 325 patients (163 assigned to tocilizumab, 162 assigned to adalimumab). Week 24 mean change from baseline in DAS28 was significantly greater in the tocilizumab group (-3·3) than in the adalimumab group (-1·8) patients (difference -1·5, 95% CI -1·8 to -1·1; p<0·0001). 16 of 162 (10%) patients in the adalimumab group versus 19 of 162 (12%) in the tocilizumab group had serious adverse events.

The objective of this study was to compare drug and adverse event costs and cost per successful clinical response with tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy vs adalimumab (ADA) monotherapy in patients with RA in a phase 4 clinical trial.\nMETHODS\nPatients received either TCZ intravenously every 4 weeks or ADA subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Drug and administration costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, respectively. Outcomes included patient-level drug costs, cost of hospitalization due to adverse events, and cost per response. Cost per response was calculated by dividing the mean drug plus administration cost by the proportion of patients achieving Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) < 2.6 (remission) or 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement in response per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20/50/70). Hospitalization costs were calculated using the daily hospital cost and number of hospital days.\nRESULTS\nAmong the 163 patients treated with TCZ and 162 patients treated with ADA, mean total drug and administration costs per patient over 24 weeks were $18,290.60 and $25,623.10, respectively. Mean drug and administration costs per each clinical response achieved were lower with TCZ than with ADA (DAS28 < 2.6: $45,868 vs $244,174; ACR20: $28,127 vs $51,887; ACR50: $38,720 vs $92,244; ACR70: $56,253 vs $143,136). The total hospital days were 32 days with TCZ and 43 days with ADA; mean hospital costs per patient were $484.50 with TCZ and $651.10 with ADA.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this comparative assessment, the cost to achieve all 4 clinical endpoints was lower for patients receiving TCZ than for those receiving ADA.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25773552\">Title: Economic evaluation of tocilizumab monotherapy compared to adalimumab monotherapy in the treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis.\nAuthors: Carlson, Josh J, Ogale, Sarika, Dejonckheere, Fred et al. | Year: 2015 | Journal: Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nTo estimate the cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy (Mono) versus adalimumab (ADA) Mono from the US payer perspective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis for whom methotrexate is inappropriate.\nMETHODS\nWe compared TCZ Mono (8 mg/kg monthly) with ADA Mono (40 mg every other week), using efficacy results from a head-to-head study, ADalimumab ACTemrA (ADACTA). We calculated the incremental cost per responder (achievement of American College of Rheumatology [ACR] 20% improvement criteria, ACR 50% improvement criteria, ACR 70% improvement criteria, or low disease activity score) for TCZ versus ADA at 6 months. A patient-level simulation was used to estimate the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of initiating treatment with TCZ Mono versus ADA Mono. Both drugs are followed by an etanercept-certolizumab-palliative care sequence. Nonresponders discontinue at 6 months; responders experience a constant probability of discontinuation. Discontinuers move to the next treatment. ACR responses produce changes in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. We mapped the HAQ score to utility to estimate QALYs. Costs include those related to hospitalization and those related to treatment (drug acquisition, administration, and monitoring). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted, along with several scenario analyses.\nRESULTS\nCompared with ADA, TCZ was more effective, with an estimated 6-month incremental cost ranging from $6,570 per additional low disease activity score achiever to $14,265 per additional ACR 70% improvement criteria responder. The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $36,944/QALY.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTCZ Mono is projected to be cost-effective compared with ADA Mono in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis for whom methotrexate is not appropriate, from a US payer perspective.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"28955499\">Title: Impact of tocilizumab monotherapy on patient-reported outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from two randomised controlled trials.\nAuthors: Strand, Vibeke, Michalska, Margaret, Birchwood, Christine et al. | Year: 2017 | Journal: RMD open\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nTwo randomised controlled trials, AMBITION (NCT00109408) and ADACTA (NCT01119859), showed tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy superior to methotrexate (MTX) and adalimumab (ADA) monotherapy, respectively, for improving rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity. This study compared the benefit of TCZ versus MTX or ADA monotherapy for improving patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with RA.\nMETHODS\nPROs included patient global assessment (PtGA), pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue and Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) and eight domain scores. Outcomes included proportions of patients reporting changes from baseline in PRO scores ≥minimum clinically important differences (MCID) and ≥age-matched and gender-matched normative values at 24 weeks.\nRESULTS\nIn AMBITION, TCZ-treated patients reported significantly greater mean improvements in HAQ (-0.7 vs -0.5), FACIT-Fatigue (8.7 vs 5.7), SF-36 PCS (9.8 vs 7.8) and five SF-36 domains at week 24 than with MTX; 45.0%-84.0% of TCZ-treated patients reported improvements ≥MCID, and 24.3%-52.1% reported scores ≥normative values across all PROs versus 39.4%-81.8% and 14.5%-45.0%, respectively, with MTX. In ADACTA, TCZ-treated patients reported significantly greater improvements in PtGA (-42.3 vs -31.8), pain (-40.1 vs -28.7), SF-36 MCS (7.9 vs 5.0) and three SF-36 domains than with ADA; 57.7%-83.3% of TCZ-treated patients reported improvements ≥MCID, and 22.1%-49.3% reported scores ≥normative values across all PROs versus 13.6%-37.8%, respectively, with ADA.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTCZ monotherapy resulted in more patients reporting clinically meaningful PRO improvements and PRO scores ≥normative values compared with MTX or ADA monotherapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS\nNCT00109408 and NCT01119859; Post-results.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24100773\">Title: [Economic evaluation of rheumathoid arthritis monotherapy with tocilizumab and adalimumab].\nAuthors: Navarro Sarabia, Federico, Blanco, Francisco J, Álvaro Gracia, José Ma et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Revista espanola de salud publica\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nTocilizumab (TCZ) was superior to adalimumab (ADA), as monotherapy, in reducing signs and symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when methotrexate (MTX) treatment is poorly tolerated or inappropriate. The aim of the study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of TCZ vs ADA in these patients.\nMETHODS\nEconomic evaluation of the cost per response or remission of TCZ vs ADA from ADACTA (time horizon: 24 weeks). Clinical response criteria ACR or disease remission criteria, DAS28.\nPERSPECTIVE\nNational Health System. The costs included (acquisition, administration and monitoring of medicines; € 2012) were obtained from Spanish sources. Simple univariate sensitivity analyzes were performed.\nRESULTS\nACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates with TCZ and ADA were obtained in 65% and 49.4% (p <0.01), 47.2% and 27.8% (p <0.01); and 32.5% and 17.9% (p <0.01) of patients, respectively. DAS28 remission occurred in 39.9% and 10.5%, respectively (p <0.0001). The cost per response was lower with TCZ than with ADA (ACR20: € 8,105 and € 11,553; ACR50: € 11,162 and € 20,529; ACR70: € 16,211 and € 31,882) respectively. The cost of DAS28 remission was € 13,204 and € 54,352, respectively.

Currently, the relationship between pathogenic molecular drivers of disease in RA and therapeutic response is poorly understood.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed synovial tissue samples from two RA cohorts of 49 and 20 patients using a combination of global gene expression, histologic and cellular analyses, and analysis of gene expression data from two further publicly available RA cohorts. To identify candidate serum biomarkers that correspond to differential synovial biology and clinical response to targeted therapies, we performed pre-treatment biomarker analysis compared with therapeutic outcome at week 24 in serum samples from 198 patients from the ADACTA (ADalimumab ACTemrA) phase 4 trial of tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) monotherapy versus adalimumab (anti-TNFα) monotherapy.\nRESULTS\nWe documented evidence for four major phenotypes of RA synovium - lymphoid, myeloid, low inflammatory, and fibroid - each with distinct underlying gene expression signatures. We observed that baseline synovial myeloid, but not lymphoid, gene signature expression was higher in patients with good compared with poor European league against rheumatism (EULAR) clinical response to anti-TNFα therapy at week 16 (P =0.011). We observed that high baseline serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM1), associated with the myeloid phenotype, and high serum C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13), associated with the lymphoid phenotype, had differential relationships with clinical response to anti-TNFα compared with anti-IL6R treatment. sICAM1-high/CXCL13-low patients showed the highest week 24 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate to anti-TNFα treatment as compared with sICAM1-low/CXCL13-high patients (42% versus 13%, respectively, P =0.05) while anti-IL-6R patients showed the opposite relationship with these biomarker subgroups (ACR50 20% versus 69%, P =0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data demonstrate that underlying molecular and cellular heterogeneity in RA impacts clinical outcome to therapies targeting different biological pathways, with patients with the myeloid phenotype exhibiting the most robust response to anti-TNFα. These data suggest a path to identify and validate serum biomarkers that predict response to targeted therapies in rheumatoid arthritis and possibly other autoimmune diseases.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT01119859</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"31907758\">Title: Comparative Cost per Response for 4 Clinical Endpoints with Tocilizumab Monotherapy vs Adalimumab Monotherapy in a Head-to-Head Randomized Double-Blind Superiority Trial (ADACTA) in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.\nAuthors: Best, Jennie H, Vlad, Steven C, Pei, Jinglan | Year: 2020 | Journal: Rheumatology and therapy\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nThe cost-effectiveness of different biologic therapies can be an important component in guiding treatment decisions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The total hospital days were 32 days with TCZ and 43 days with ADA; mean hospital costs per patient were $484.50 with TCZ and $651.10 with ADA.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this comparative assessment, the cost to achieve all 4 clinical endpoints was lower for patients receiving TCZ than for those receiving ADA.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"25773552\">Title: Economic evaluation of tocilizumab monotherapy compared to adalimumab monotherapy in the treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis.\nAuthors: Carlson, Josh J, Ogale, Sarika, Dejonckheere, Fred et al. | Year: 2015 | Journal: Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research\nAbstract: OBJECTIVES\nTo estimate the cost-effectiveness of tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy (Mono) versus adalimumab (ADA) Mono from the US payer perspective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis for whom methotrexate is inappropriate.\nMETHODS\nWe compared TCZ Mono (8 mg/kg monthly) with ADA Mono (40 mg every other week), using efficacy results from a head-to-head study, ADalimumab ACTemrA (ADACTA). We calculated the incremental cost per responder (achievement of American College of Rheumatology [ACR] 20% improvement criteria, ACR 50% improvement criteria, ACR 70% improvement criteria, or low disease activity score) for TCZ versus ADA at 6 months. A patient-level simulation was used to estimate the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of initiating treatment with TCZ Mono versus ADA Mono. Both drugs are followed by an etanercept-certolizumab-palliative care sequence. Nonresponders discontinue at 6 months; responders experience a constant probability of discontinuation. Discontinuers move to the next treatment. ACR responses produce changes in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. We mapped the HAQ score to utility to estimate QALYs. Costs include those related to hospitalization and those related to treatment (drug acquisition, administration, and monitoring). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted, along with several scenario analyses.\nRESULTS\nCompared with ADA, TCZ was more effective, with an estimated 6-month incremental cost ranging from $6,570 per additional low disease activity score achiever to $14,265 per additional ACR 70% improvement criteria responder. The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $36,944/QALY.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTCZ Mono is projected to be cost-effective compared with ADA Mono in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis for whom methotrexate is not appropriate, from a US payer perspective.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24100773\">Title: [Economic evaluation of rheumathoid arthritis monotherapy with tocilizumab and adalimumab].\nAuthors: Navarro Sarabia, Federico, Blanco, Francisco J, Álvaro Gracia, José Ma et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: Revista espanola de salud publica\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nTocilizumab (TCZ) was superior to adalimumab (ADA), as monotherapy, in reducing signs and symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when methotrexate (MTX) treatment is poorly tolerated or inappropriate. The aim of the study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of TCZ vs ADA in these patients.\nMETHODS\nEconomic evaluation of the cost per response or remission of TCZ vs ADA from ADACTA (time horizon: 24 weeks). Clinical response criteria ACR or disease remission criteria, DAS28.\nPERSPECTIVE\nNational Health System. The costs included (acquisition, administration and monitoring of medicines; € 2012) were obtained from Spanish sources. Simple univariate sensitivity analyzes were performed.\nRESULTS\nACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates with TCZ and ADA were obtained in 65% and 49.4% (p <0.01), 47.2% and 27.8% (p <0.01); and 32.5% and 17.9% (p <0.01) of patients, respectively. DAS28 remission occurred in 39.9% and 10.5%, respectively (p <0.0001). The cost per response was lower with TCZ than with ADA (ACR20: € 8,105 and € 11,553; ACR50: € 11,162 and € 20,529; ACR70: € 16,211 and € 31,882) respectively. The cost of DAS28 remission was € 13,204 and € 54,352, respectively. Treatment with TCZ was dominant (more effective, with lower costs vs ADA) in all scenarios analyzed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to this analysis, in Spain TCZ monotherapy is an efficient strategy vs ADA for treating RA patients intolerant to MTX or in which there is inappropriate response.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">AMBITION tocilizumab methotrexate monotherapy</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 8 results.

The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24.\nRESULTS\nThe intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that tocilizumab was better than methotrexate treatment with a higher ACR20 response (69.9 vs 52.5%; p<0.001), and 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) <2.6 rate (33.6 vs 12.1%) at week 24. Mean high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was within the normal range from week 12 with tocilizumab, whereas levels remained elevated with methotrexate. The incidence of serious adverse events with tocilizumab was 3.8% versus 2.8% with methotrexate (p = 0.50), and of serious infections, 1.4% versus 0.7%, respectively.

We investigated the scope of released extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolites as a consequence of tissue remodelling in patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) and tocilizumab (TCZ) compared to placebo.\nMETHODS\nTissue metabolites from 387 RA patients treated with either TCZ (8 mg/kg) or MTX monotherapy (7.5-20 mg/kg) were measured at baseline and 8 weeks sera by validated ELISA assays. The levels of collagen biomarkers (C1M, C2M, C3M and C4M) together with C-reactive protein (CRP) and CRP metabolite (CRPM) were investigated. Baseline levels of biomarkers have been compared with 72 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Comparison between treatment and response groups were done by ANCOVA, Spearman's correlation and logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, BMI and disease duration.\nRESULTS\nC1M and C3M were significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by TCZ and C3M by MTX (P < 0.01) compared to placebo. C1M and C3M inhibition with TCZ was respectively 23% and 16% greater than that of MTX (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001). C4M was inhibited by TCZ and MTX, but the effect of TCZ was 22% greater than MTX (P < 0.0001). TCZ and MTX had minimal effect on C2M levels. MTX had no effect on CRP and CRPM, whereas TCZ reduced their levels to 69% and 27% from baseline. Investigated biomarkers revealed a significant (P < 0.05) difference in biomarker profiles of MTX ACR50 treatment responders and non-responders. Change to week 8 in levels of C3M, C4M, CRP and CRPM in MTX patients correlated significantly (rho = 0.41 to 0.18, P < 0.0001 to 0.039) with change in disease activity (DAS28) at weeks 8, 16 and 24, whereas only CRP in TCZ patients (rho = 0.32 to 0.21, P < 0.0001 to 0.01).\nCONCLUSION\nPatients receiving TCZ treatment for 8 weeks had higher suppression of tissue remodelling and inflammatory biomarkers over patients treated with MTX. Measured biomarkers enabled for a discrimination of biomarker profiles of ACR50 treatment responding patients and identification of those who benefit at the early time point. Week 8 change in levels of C3M, C4M, CRP and CRPM significantly predicted clinical response to treatment and correlated with DAS28 at all time points.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00109408 .

Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a compound that inhibits the IL-6 receptor. Following initial studies in Japan, it has been extensively studied in five multicenter clinical trials. This report concentrates on the Actemra Versus Methotrexate Double-blind Investigative Trial in Monotherapy (AMBITION), which compared TCZ monotherapy (8 mg/kg every 4 weeks) with methotrexate monotherapy over 24 weeks. TCZ was shown to be the first biologic agent that is superior to methotrexate across a whole range of clinical outcomes measures with a rapid onset of effect. Significant liver toxicity was less common in the TCZ group. However, increases in lipids and decreases in neutrophils and skin infections were more common in the TCZ arm. Long-term efficacy and safety follow-up is ongoing. This trial supports the use of TCZ as monotherapy and suggests it should be regarded as a first-line biologic therapy.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32033935\">Title: Effect on efficacy and safety trial outcomes of also enrolling patients on ongoing glucocorticoid therapy in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials of tocilizumab or adalimumab or methotrexate monotherapy.\nAuthors: Safy-Khan, Mary, Jacobs, Johannes W G, de Hair, Maria J H et al. | Year: 2020 | Journal: Annals of the rheumatic diseases\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nIn rheumatoid arthritis (RA) trials, inclusion of patients on background treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) might impact efficacy and safety outcomes.\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine if inclusion of patients on background GC use influenced efficacy and safety outcomes of RA randomised clinical trials on initiation of tocilizumab (TCZ) or adalimumab (ADA) or methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy.\nMETHODS\nData of four double-blind RA randomised controlled trials (AMBITION, ACT-RAY, ADACTA and FUNCTION) with in total four TCZ, one ADA and two MTX monotherapy arms were analysed. Analyses of covariance of changes from baseline to week 24 in efficacy endpoints and radiographic progression up to week 104 were performed, correcting for relevant covariates. Incidence rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed.\nRESULTS\nNo statistically significant differences were found in efficacy parameters between background GC users and non-GC users, except for less radiographic progression associated with GC usage in one MTX arm. SAE rates were not statistically significantly different between GC users and non-GC users in the treatment arms.\nCONCLUSION\nNo effect of including patients on background GC treatment on efficacy and safety trial outcomes was found, with the exception of reduced radiological joint damage in one MTX arm.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">18318687 AMBITION</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 4413 results.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition mentions ambition only once, in a peripheral comment concerning narcissistic personality disorder, psychopathological states associated with ambition are commonly encountered in everyday life. Ambition has been linked to narcissism, power, and dominance, but it is distinct from each of these concepts. Although the development of ambition is most strongly influenced by social, cultural, and demographic factors, evidence suggests that genetic and biological factors also contribute.This article describes how ambition-related psychopathologies can manifest as 1) misalignment of ambitions and capabilities; 2) \"blind ambition\"; 3) distortions associated with bipolar and other mood disorders; 4) amalgams of ambition with Machiavellian traits, psychopathy, narcissism, and sadism (i.e., dark triad/tetrad traits); and 5) amotivation/apathy syndrome deficits associated with general medical and psychiatric conditions.The field requires more robust measures for assessing ambition, further delineation of ambition-related psychopathologies, and effective treatments for these conditions.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"39379563\">Title: Action on ambition.\nAuthors:  | Year: 2024 | Journal: Nature ecology & evolution\nAbstract: </snippet>\n<snippet id=\"32336692\">Title: Ethical Concerns with Applied Behavior Analysis for Autism Spectrum \"Disorder\".\nAuthors: Wilkenfeld, Daniel A, McCarthy, Allison M | Year: 2020 | Journal: Kennedy Institute of Ethics journal\nAbstract: This paper has both theoretical and practical ambitions. The theoretical ambitions are to explore what would constitute both effective and ethical treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the practical ambition is perhaps more important: we argue that a dominant form of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which is widely taken to be far-and-away the best \"treatment\" for ASD, manifests systematic violations of the fundamental tenets of bioethics. Moreover, the supposed benefits of the treatment not only fail to mitigate these violations, but often exacerbate them. Warnings of the perils of ABA are not original to us-autism advocates have been ringing this bell for some years. However, their pleas have been largely unheeded, and ABA continues to be offered to and quite frequently pushed upon parents as the appropriate treatment for autistic children. Our contribution is to argue that, from a bioethical perspective, autism advocates are fully justified in their concerns-the rights of autistic children and their parents are being regularly infringed upon. Specifically, we will argue that employing ABA violates the principles of justice and nonmaleficence and, most critically, infringes on the autonomy of children and (when pushed aggressively) of parents as well.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"37691084\">Title: Politics and Psychology.\nAuthors: Busch-Jensen, Peter, Røn-Larsen, Maja | Year: 2023 | Journal: Integrative psychological & behavioral science\nAbstract: This article presents a discussion inspired by the invitation formed by Kevin Carriere's book: \"Psychology in Policy - Redefining Politics Through The Individual\". From a theoretical standpoint in culture psychology Carriere challenges the idea of politics as a particular practice carried out by mainly politicians.

Tocilizumab--an inhibitor of interleukin 6 receptor signalling--has been studied as monotherapy in several clinical trials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab monotherapy compared with adalimumab monotherapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nMETHODS\nWe did this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 4 superiority study in 76 centres in 15 countries in North and South America, Australasia, and Europe. We enrolled patients who were aged at least 18 years, had severe rheumatoid arthritis for 6 months or more, and were intolerant to methotrexate or were inappropriate for continued methotrexate treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; block size of four) to receive tocilizumab 8 mg per kg bodyweight intravenously every 4 weeks plus placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks plus placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.

Currently, the relationship between pathogenic molecular drivers of disease in RA and therapeutic response is poorly understood.\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed synovial tissue samples from two RA cohorts of 49 and 20 patients using a combination of global gene expression, histologic and cellular analyses, and analysis of gene expression data from two further publicly available RA cohorts. To identify candidate serum biomarkers that correspond to differential synovial biology and clinical response to targeted therapies, we performed pre-treatment biomarker analysis compared with therapeutic outcome at week 24 in serum samples from 198 patients from the ADACTA (ADalimumab ACTemrA) phase 4 trial of tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) monotherapy versus adalimumab (anti-TNFα) monotherapy.\nRESULTS\nWe documented evidence for four major phenotypes of RA synovium - lymphoid, myeloid, low inflammatory, and fibroid - each with distinct underlying gene expression signatures. We observed that baseline synovial myeloid, but not lymphoid, gene signature expression was higher in patients with good compared with poor European league against rheumatism (EULAR) clinical response to anti-TNFα therapy at week 16 (P =0.011). We observed that high baseline serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM1), associated with the myeloid phenotype, and high serum C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13), associated with the lymphoid phenotype, had differential relationships with clinical response to anti-TNFα compared with anti-IL6R treatment. sICAM1-high/CXCL13-low patients showed the highest week 24 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate to anti-TNFα treatment as compared with sICAM1-low/CXCL13-high patients (42% versus 13%, respectively, P =0.05) while anti-IL-6R patients showed the opposite relationship with these biomarker subgroups (ACR50 20% versus 69%, P =0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data demonstrate that underlying molecular and cellular heterogeneity in RA impacts clinical outcome to therapies targeting different biological pathways, with patients with the myeloid phenotype exhibiting the most robust response to anti-TNFα.

Gastroenterology & hepatology\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nPatients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis are at high risk of liver-related and all-cause morbidity and mortality. We investigated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue semaglutide in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.\nMETHODS\nThis double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial enrolled patients from 38 centres in Europe and the USA. Adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH-related cirrhosis and body-mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m 2 or more were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg or visually matching placebo. Patients were randomly allocated via an interactive web response system, stratified by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an improvement in liver fibrosis of one stage or more without worsening of NASH after 48 weeks, assessed by biopsy in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is closed and completed, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03987451.\nFINDINGS\n71 patients were enrolled between June 18, 2019, and April 22, 2021; 49 (69%) patients were female and 22 (31%) were male. Patients had a mean age of 59·5 years (SD 8·0) and mean BMI of 34·9 kg/m 2 (SD 5·9); 53 (75%) patients had diabetes. 47 patients were randomly assigned to the semaglutide group and 24 to the placebo group. After 48 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients with an improvement in liver fibrosis of one stage or more without worsening of NASH (five [11%] of 47 patients in the semaglutide group vs seven [29%] of 24 in the placebo group; odds ratio 0·28 [95% CI 0·06-1·24; p=0·087). There was also no significant difference between groups in the proportion of patients who achieved NASH resolution (p=0·29). Similar proportions of patients in each group reported adverse events (42 [89%] patients in the semaglutide group vs 19 [79%] in the placebo group) and serious adverse events (six [13%] vs two [8%]). The most common adverse events were nausea (21 [45%] vs four [17%]), diarrhoea (nine [19%] vs two [8%]), and vomiting (eight [17%] vs none). Hepatic and renal function remained stable. There were no decompensating events or deaths.\nINTERPRETATION\nIn patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis, semaglutide did not significantly improve fibrosis or achievement of NASH resolution versus placebo. No new safety concerns were raised.\nFUNDING\nNovo Nordisk A/S.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33185364\">Title: A Placebo-Controlled Trial of Subcutaneous Semaglutide in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.\nAuthors: Newsome, Philip N, Buchholtz, Kristine, Cusi, Kenneth et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: The New England journal of medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common disease that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but treatment options are limited. The efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in patients with NASH is not known.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a 72-week, double-blind phase 2 trial involving patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis of stage F1, F2, or F3. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 3:3:3:1:1:1 ratio, to receive once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg or corresponding placebo. The primary end point was resolution of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis. The confirmatory secondary end point was an improvement of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of NASH. The analyses of these end points were performed only in patients with stage F2 or F3 fibrosis; other analyses were performed in all the patients.\nRESULTS\nIn total, 320 patients (of whom 230 had stage F2 or F3 fibrosis) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide at a dose of 0.1 mg (80 patients), 0.2 mg (78 patients), or 0.4 mg (82 patients) or to receive placebo (80 patients). The percentage of patients in whom NASH resolution was achieved with no worsening of fibrosis was 40% in the 0.1-mg group, 36% in the 0.2-mg group, 59% in the 0.4-mg group, and 17% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for semaglutide 0.4 mg vs. placebo). An improvement in fibrosis stage occurred in 43% of the patients in the 0.4-mg group and in 33% of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.48). The mean percent weight loss was 13% in the 0.4-mg group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of nausea, constipation, and vomiting was higher in the 0.4-mg group than in the placebo group (nausea, 42% vs. 11%; constipation, 22% vs. 12%; and vomiting, 15% vs. 2%). Malignant neoplasms were reported in 3 patients who received semaglutide (1%) and in no patients who received placebo. Overall, neoplasms (benign, malignant, or unspecified) were reported in 15% of the patients in the semaglutide groups and in 8% in the placebo group; no pattern of occurrence in specific organs was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis phase 2 trial involving patients with NASH showed that treatment with semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with NASH resolution than placebo. However, the trial did not show a significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients with an improvement in fibrosis stage.

This study aims to summarize all investigated options to date and review the use of specific endpoints at different stages of ongoing trials of noncirrhotic NASH treatments. Using a horizon scanning approach, evidence were identified including meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and AMED (up to February 2020), recently published RCTs in PubMed (2015-April 2020), RCTs presented at conferences (AASL and EASL, 2015-2020), and ongoing RCTs in ClincalTrials.gov (2015-November 2020). We included 6 meta-analyses of RCTs, 30 published RCTs, 11 conference abstracts, and 62 ongoing RCTs. An evidence map was created to demonstrate the treatment effects of 49 therapeutic modalities for NASH. Only six interventions (6/49, 12.24%) met the histological surrogate endpoints for potential conditional FDA approval. Obeticholic acid is the only therapy demonstrating positive benefits in ≥1-point improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH in a phase 3 trial. The other therapies were all phase 2 studies. ≥1-point improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH was shown in patients treated with cenicriviroc. NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis was shown in patients treated with liraglutide, semaglutide and resmetirom. Lanifibranor achieved both surrogate histological endpoints. Five ongoing RCTs (5/62, 8.06%) will investigate histological progression to cirrhosis, death, or liver-related clinical outcomes. In conclusion, some therapeutic modalities showed promising benefits, but further studies are warranted to find a definite treatment of NASH which prevents progression to cirrhosis and adverse liver outcomes.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"35614896\">Title: Diagnostic and Therapy of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Narrative Review.\nAuthors: Roeb, Elke | Year: 2022 | Journal: Visceral medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing and strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, especially with obesity. A subtype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), might progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH patients have an increased all-cause mortality. First and foremost are malignancies, followed by cardiovascular diseases.\nSUMMARY\nThe NAFLD fibrosis score and noninvasive liver stiffness measurement (transient hepatic elastography) are essential components for the diagnostic risk assessment of NAFLD patients. Other steatoses (alcohol, genetic disorders, drugs, toxins, malnutrition, etc.) must be considered in the differential diagnosis. So far, there is no approved liver-specific drug therapy with a proven effect on NAFLD for patients without diabetes mellitus. Obeticholic acid (FXR agonist), cenicriviroc (a dual inhibitor of the chemokine receptors (CCR), CCR2 and CCR5), acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors, and several thyroid hormone analogs are the most advanced substances in clinical development in ongoing phase 2 and 3 studies.\nKEY MESSAGES\nWeight loss, physical training, and the screening and treatment of risk factors represent the cornerstones of NAFLD therapy. Treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide) and sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 inhibitors can be recommended in patients with diabetes and NASH.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"33513761\">Title: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: An Updated Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.\nAuthors: Mantovani, Alessandro, Petracca, Graziana, Beatrice, Giorgia et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Metabolites\nAbstract: To assess the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) for treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or steatohepatitis (NASH), we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Three large electronic databases were systematically searched (up to 15 December 2020) to identify placebo-controlled or active-controlled RCTs using different GLP-1 RAs. We included eleven placebo-controlled or active-controlled phase-2 RCTs (involving a total of 936 middle-aged individuals) that used liraglutide ( n = 6 RCTs), exenatide ( n = 3 RCTs), dulaglutide ( n = 1 RCT) or semaglutide ( n = 1 RCT) to specifically treat NAFLD or NASH, detected by liver biopsy ( n = 2 RCTs) or imaging techniques ( n = 9 RCTs). Compared to placebo or reference therapy, treatment with GLP-1 RAs for a median of 26 weeks was associated with significant reductions in the absolute percentage of liver fat content on magnetic resonance-based techniques (pooled weighted mean difference: -3.92%, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -6.27% to -1.56%) and serum liver enzyme levels, as well as with greater histological resolution of NASH without worsening of liver fibrosis (pooled random-effects odds ratio 4.06, 95% CI 2.52-6.55; for liraglutide and semaglutide only). In conclusion, treatment with GLP-1 RAs (mostly liraglutide and semaglutide) is a promising treatment option for NAFLD or NASH that warrants further investigation.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<call_tool name=\"pubmed_search\" limit=\"5\">liraglutide LEAN NASH trial</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 3 results.

These analogues are licensed for type 2 diabetes, but their efficacy in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is unknown. We assessed the safety and efficacy of the long-acting GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide, in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nMETHODS\nThis multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial was conducted in four UK medical centres to assess subcutaneous injections of liraglutide (1·8 mg daily) compared with placebo for patients who are overweight and show clinical evidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by trial centre and diabetes status. The trial was designed using A'Hern's single-group method, which required eight (38%) of 21 successes in the liraglutide group for the effect of liraglutide to be considered clinically significant. Patients, investigators, clinical trial site staff, and pathologists were masked to treatment assignment throughout the study. The primary outcome measure was resolution of definite non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with no worsening in fibrosis from baseline to end of treatment (48 weeks), as assessed centrally by two independent pathologists. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat analysis, which included all patients who underwent end-of-treatment biopsy. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01237119.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Aug 1, 2010, and May 31, 2013, 26 patients were randomly assigned to receive liraglutide and 26 to placebo. Nine (39%) of 23 patients who received liraglutide and underwent end-of-treatment liver biopsy had resolution of definite non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared with two (9%) of 22 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 4·3 [95% CI 1·0-17·7]; p=0·019). Two (9%) of 23 patients in the liraglutide group versus eight (36%) of 22 patients in the placebo group had progression of fibrosis (0·2 [0·1-1·0]; p=0·04). Most adverse events were grade 1 (mild) to grade 2 (moderate) in severity, transient, and similar in the two treatment groups for all organ classes and symptoms, with the exception of gastrointestinal disorders in 21 (81%) of 23 patients in the liraglutide group and 17 (65%) of 22 patients in the placebo group, which included diarrhoea (ten [38%] patients in the liraglutide group vs five [19%] in the placebo group), constipation (seven [27%] vs none), and loss of appetite (eight [31%] vs two [8%]).\nINTERPRETATION\nLiraglutide was safe, well tolerated, and led to histological resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, warranting extensive, longer-term studies.\nFUNDING\nWellcome Trust, National Institute of Health Research, and Novo Nordisk.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"29957886\">Title: Effects of liraglutide, metformin and gliclazide on body composition in patients with both type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A randomized trial.\nAuthors: Feng, Wen-Huan, Bi, Yan, Li, Ping et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Journal of diabetes investigation\nAbstract: AIMS/INTRODUCTION\nTo compare the effects of gliclazide, liraglutide and metformin on body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 85 patients were randomly allocated to receive gliclazide (n = 27), liraglutide (n = 29) or metformin (n = 29) monotherapy for 24 weeks. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\nRESULTS\nLiraglutide and metformin reduced total, trunk, limb, android and gynoid fat mass; this also led to weight reduction. However, gliclazide treatment produced no significant changes in weight or fat mass, likely because reductions in fat mass were concomitant with increases in lean tissue mass. Blood glucose concentrations and glycated hemoglobin levels improved in all treatment arms; levels of the latter were lower in patients treated with liraglutide and metformin. Serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations decreased in all treatment arms, whereas serum aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were reduced only by liraglutide and metformin. In all patients, weight loss and total, trunk, limb, and android fat mass reductions were positively correlated with decreases in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, whereas reductions in waist circumference were positively correlated with lower serum alanine aminotransferase levels.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with gliclazide, liraglutide and metformin monotherapies result in greater weight loss, reductions in body fat mass, and better blood glucose control among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Reductions in weight, fat mass and waist circumference favorably affect hepatic function.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\"24189085\">Title: Liraglutide efficacy and action in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (LEAN): study protocol for a phase II multicentre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial.\nAuthors: Armstrong, Matthew J, Barton, Darren, Gaunt, Piers et al. | Year: 2013 | Journal: BMJ open\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease. Despite this, there are no universally accepted pharmacological therapies for NASH. Liraglutide (Victoza), a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been shown to improve weight loss, glycaemic control and liver enzymes in type 2 diabetes. There is currently a lack of prospective-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of GLP-1 analogues in patients with NASH.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nLiraglutide efficacy and action in NASH (LEAN) is a phase II, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate whether a 48-week treatment with 1.8 mg liraglutide will result in improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH. Adult, overweight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)) patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH were assessed for eligibility at five recruitment centres in the UK. Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of either 1.8 mg liraglutide or liraglutide-placebo (control). Using A'Hern's single stage phase II methodology (significance level 0.05; power 0.90) and accounting for an estimated 20% withdrawal rate, a minimum of 25 patients were randomised to each treatment group. The primary outcome measure will be centrally assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of evaluable patients achieving an improvement in liver histology between liver biopsies at baseline and after 48 weeks of treatment. Histological improvement will be defined as a combination of the disappearance of active NASH and no worsening in fibrosis.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThe protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (East Midlands-Northampton committee; 10/H0402/32) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Recruitment into the LEAN started in August 2010 and ended in May 2013, with 52 patients randomised. The treatment follow-up of LEAN participants is currently ongoing and is due to finish in July 2014. The findings of this trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international presentations.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov NCT01237119.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n## Evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists can improve NASH resolution (histology-based)\nThe strongest supportive evidence comes from randomized, placebo-controlled liver-biopsy trials showing higher rates of **histologic NASH resolution** (typically defined as resolution of steatohepatitis, often with no worsening of fibrosis) with GLP-1 receptor agonists:\n\n- **Liraglutide (LEAN trial)** demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving **resolution of definite NASH with no worsening of fibrosis** vs placebo at 48 weeks. <cite id=\"26608256\">LEAN: 39% (liraglutide) vs 9% (placebo), p=0.019 for NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis.</cite>\n- **Semaglutide (phase 2 NASH trial)** demonstrated a dose-dependent and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint **resolution of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis** (among patients with F2–F3 fibrosis in the primary analysis), driven by the highest dose. <cite id=\"33185364\">Semaglutide phase 2: 59% (0.4 mg) vs 17% (placebo), P&lt;0.001 for NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis.</cite>\n- A meta-analysis of randomized trials (including biopsy-based endpoints) similarly concluded GLP-1 RAs (notably liraglutide/semaglutide) increase the odds of **histologic NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis**. <cite id=\"33513761\">Updated meta-analysis: GLP-1 RAs associated with higher odds of histologic NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis (liraglutide and semaglutide trials).</cite>\n\n## Head-to-head comparison of key histologic outcomes: LEAN (liraglutide) vs phase 2 semaglutide trial\n\n### 1) Primary “NASH resolution” outcome (with fibrosis not worse)\n- **Liraglutide (LEAN, 48 weeks, 1.8 mg daily SC):**\n  - **NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis:** **39%** vs **9%** (placebo). <cite id=\"26608256\">LEAN primary endpoint: 9/23 (39%) vs 2/22 (9%).</cite>\n\n- **Semaglutide (phase 2, 72 weeks, daily SC 0.1/0.2/0.4 mg; primary analysis in F2–F3):**\n  - **NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis (dose response):** **40% (0.1 mg), 36% (0.2 mg), 59% (0.4 mg)** vs **17%** (placebo). <cite id=\"33185364\">Semaglutide primary endpoint: 59% at 0.4 mg vs 17% placebo; lower-dose arms also above placebo.</cite>\n\n**Comparison:** Both trials support improved NASH resolution vs placebo.

Patients were randomly allocated via an interactive web response system, stratified by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an improvement in liver fibrosis of one stage or more without worsening of NASH after 48 weeks, assessed by biopsy in the intention-to-treat population.

The efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in patients with NASH is not known.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a 72-week, double-blind phase 2 trial involving patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis of stage F1, F2, or F3. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 3:3:3:1:1:1 ratio, to receive once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg or corresponding placebo. The primary end point was resolution of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis. The confirmatory secondary end point was an improvement of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of NASH. The analyses of these end points were performed only in patients with stage F2 or F3 fibrosis; other analyses were performed in all the patients.\nRESULTS\nIn total, 320 patients (of whom 230 had stage F2 or F3 fibrosis) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide at a dose of 0.1 mg (80 patients), 0.2 mg (78 patients), or 0.4 mg (82 patients) or to receive placebo (80 patients). The percentage of patients in whom NASH resolution was achieved with no worsening of fibrosis was 40% in the 0.1-mg group, 36% in the 0.2-mg group, 59% in the 0.4-mg group, and 17% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for semaglutide 0.4 mg vs. placebo). An improvement in fibrosis stage occurred in 43% of the patients in the 0.4-mg group and in 33% of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.48). The mean percent weight loss was 13% in the 0.4-mg group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of nausea, constipation, and vomiting was higher in the 0.4-mg group than in the placebo group (nausea, 42% vs. 11%; constipation, 22% vs. 12%; and vomiting, 15% vs. 2%). Malignant neoplasms were reported in 3 patients who received semaglutide (1%) and in no patients who received placebo. Overall, neoplasms (benign, malignant, or unspecified) were reported in 15% of the patients in the semaglutide groups and in 8% in the placebo group; no pattern of occurrence in specific organs was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis phase 2 trial involving patients with NASH showed that treatment with semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with NASH resolution than placebo.

Other steatoses (alcohol, genetic disorders, drugs, toxins, malnutrition, etc.) must be considered in the differential diagnosis. So far, there is no approved liver-specific drug therapy with a proven effect on NAFLD for patients without diabetes mellitus.

However, gliclazide treatment produced no significant changes in weight or fat mass, likely because reductions in fat mass were concomitant with increases in lean tissue mass. Blood glucose concentrations and glycated hemoglobin levels improved in all treatment arms; levels of the latter were lower in patients treated with liraglutide and metformin. Serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations decreased in all treatment arms, whereas serum aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were reduced only by liraglutide and metformin.

Despite this, there are no universally accepted pharmacological therapies for NASH. Liraglutide (Victoza), a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been shown to improve weight loss, glycaemic control and liver enzymes in type 2 diabetes. There is currently a lack of prospective-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of GLP-1 analogues in patients with NASH.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nLiraglutide efficacy and action in NASH (LEAN) is a phase II, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial designed to investigate whether a 48-week treatment with 1.8 mg liraglutide will result in improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH. Adult, overweight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)) patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH were assessed for eligibility at five recruitment centres in the UK. Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of either 1.8 mg liraglutide or liraglutide-placebo (control). Using A'Hern's single stage phase II methodology (significance level 0.05; power 0.90) and accounting for an estimated 20% withdrawal rate, a minimum of 25 patients were randomised to each treatment group. The primary outcome measure will be centrally assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of evaluable patients achieving an improvement in liver histology between liver biopsies at baseline and after 48 weeks of treatment. Histological improvement will be defined as a combination of the disappearance of active NASH and no worsening in fibrosis.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThe protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (East Midlands-Northampton committee; 10/H0402/32) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Recruitment into the LEAN started in August 2010 and ended in May 2013, with 52 patients randomised. The treatment follow-up of LEAN participants is currently ongoing and is due to finish in July 2014.
