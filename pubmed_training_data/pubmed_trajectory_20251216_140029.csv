Absent or decreased function of the CFTR protein is associated with multiorgan dysfunction and shortened life expectancy.\nOBSERVATIONS\nCFTR is an anion channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Loss of function leads to obstructed exocrine glands. Of people with cystic fibrosis in the US, approximately 85.5% have the gene variant F508del. Manifestations of cystic fibrosis in patients with the F508del gene variant begin in infancy with steatorrhea, poor weight gain, and respiratory symptoms (coughing, wheezing). As people with cystic fibrosis age, chronic respiratory bacterial infections cause loss of lung function and bronchiectasis. With the availability of universal newborn screening in multiple countries including the US, many people with cystic fibrosis are asymptomatic at diagnosis. With multidisciplinary care teams that included dietitians, respiratory therapists, and social workers, treatment of cystic fibrosis can slow disease progression. Median survival has improved from 36.3 years (95% CI, 35.1-37.9) in 2006 to 53.1 years (95% CI, 51.6-54.7) in 2021. Pulmonary therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis consist of mucolytics (eg, dornase alfa), anti-inflammatories (eg, azithromycin), and antibiotics (such as tobramycin delivered by a nebulizer). Four small molecular therapies, termed CFTR modulators, that facilitate CFTR production and/or function have received regulatory approval. Examples are ivacaftor and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. For example, in patients with 1 F508del variant, the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor improved lung function from -0.2% in the placebo group to 13.6% (difference, 13.8%; 95% CI, 12.1%-15.4%) and decreased the annualized estimated rate of pulmonary exacerbations from 0.98 to 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55). Improved respiratory function and symptoms have lasted up to 144 weeks in postapproval observational studies. An additional 177 variants are eligible for treatment with the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination.\nCONCLUSION\nCystic fibrosis affects approximately 89 000 people worldwide and is associated with a spectrum of disease related to exocrine dysfunction, including chronic respiratory bacterial infections and reduced life expectancy. First-line pulmonary therapies consist of mucolytics, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics, and approximately 90% of people with cystic fibrosis who are 2 years or older may benefit from a combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""31679946\"">Title: Efficacy and safety of the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor combination regimen in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation: a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.\nAuthors: Heijerman, Harry G M, McKone, Edward F, Downey, Damian G et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Lancet (London, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators correct the basic defect caused by CFTR mutations. Improvements in health outcomes have been achieved with the combination of a CFTR corrector and potentiator in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation. The addition of elexacaftor (VX-445), a next-generation CFTR corrector, to tezacaftor plus ivacaftor further improved F508del-CFTR function and clinical outcomes in a phase 2 study in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.\nMETHODS\nThis phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial of elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor was done at 44 sites in four countries. Eligible participants were those with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation, aged 12 years or older with stable disease, and with a percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV 1 ) of 40-90%, inclusive. After a 4-week tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 4 weeks of elexacaftor 200 mg orally once daily plus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h versus tezacaftor 100 mg orally once daily plus ivacaftor 150 mg orally every 12 h alone. The primary outcome was the absolute change from baseline (measured at the end of the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor run-in) in ppFEV 1 at week 4. Key secondary outcomes were absolute change in sweat chloride and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain (CFQ-R RD) score. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03525548.\nFINDINGS\nBetween Aug 3 and Dec 28, 2018, 113 participants were enrolled. Following the run-in, 107 participants were randomly assigned (55 in the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group and 52 in the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group) and completed the 4-week treatment period. The elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group had improvements in the primary outcome of ppFEV 1 (least squares mean [LSM] treatment difference of 10·0 percentage points [95% CI 7·4 to 12·6], p<0·0001) and the key secondary outcomes of sweat chloride concentration (LSM treatment difference -45·1 mmol/L [95% CI -50·1 to -40·1], p<0·0001), and CFQ-R RD score (LSM treatment difference 17·4 points [95% CI 11·8 to 23·0], p<0·0001) compared with the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group. The triple combination regimen was well tolerated, with no discontinuations. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; serious adverse events occurred in two (4%) participants receiving elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor and in one (2%) receiving tezacaftor plus ivacaftor.\nINTERPRETATION\nElexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinically robust benefit compared with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor alone, with a favourable safety profile, and shows the potential to lead to transformative improvements in the lives of people with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del mutation.\nFUNDING\nVertex Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34782259\"">Title: Complete CFTR gene sequencing in 5,058 individuals with cystic fibrosis informs variant-specific treatment.\nAuthors: Raraigh, Karen S, Aksit, Melis A, Hetrick, Kurt et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive condition caused by variants in each CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) allele. Clinically affected individuals without two identified causal variants typically have no further interrogation of CFTR beyond examination of coding regions, but the development of variant-specific CFTR-targeted treatments necessitates complete understanding of CFTR genotype.\nMETHODS\nWhole genome sequences were analyzed on 5,058 individuals with CF. We focused on the full CFTR gene sequence and identified disease-causing variants in three phases: screening for known and structural variants; discovery of novel loss-of-function variants; and investigation of remaining variants.\nRESULTS\nAll variants identified in the first two phases and coding region variants found in the third phase were interpreted according to CFTR2 or ACMG criteria (n = 371; 16 [4.3%] previously unreported). Full gene sequencing enabled delineation of 18 structural variants (large insertions or deletions), of which two were novel. Additional CFTR variants of uncertain effect were found in 76 F508del homozygotes and in 21 individuals with other combinations of CF-causing variants. Both causative variants were identified in 98.1% (n = 4,960) of subjects, an increase of 2.3 percentage points from the 95.8% (n = 4,847) who had a registry- or chart-reported disease-causing CFTR genotype. Of the remaining 98 individuals, 78 carried one variant that has been associated with CF (CF-causing [n = 70] or resulting in varying clinical consequences n = 8]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nComplete CFTR gene sequencing in 5,058 individuals with CF identified at least one DNA variant in 99.6% of the cohort that is targetable by current molecular or emerging gene-based therapeutic technologies.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""35816621\"">Title: Efficacy and Safety of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Children 6 Through 11 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis Heterozygous for F508del and a Minimal Function Mutation: A Phase 3b, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study.\nAuthors: Mall, Marcus A, Brugha, Rossa, Gartner, Silvia et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: Rationale: The triple-combination regimen elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) was shown to be safe and efficacious in children aged 6 through 11 years with cystic fibrosis and at least one F508del-CFTR allele in a phase 3, open-label, single-arm study. Objectives: To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children 6 through 11 years of age with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function CFTR mutation ( F /MF genotypes) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3b trial. Methods: Children were randomized to receive either ELX/TEZ/IVA ( n = 60) or placebo ( n = 61) during a 24-week treatment period. The dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA administered was based on weight at screening, with children <30 kg receiving ELX 100 mg once daily, TEZ 50 mg once daily, and IVA 75 mg every 12 hours, and children ⩾30 kg receiving ELX 200 mg once daily, TEZ 100 mg once daily, and IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (adult dose). Measurements and Main Results: The primary endpoint was absolute change in lung clearance index 2.5 from baseline through Week 24. Children given ELX/TEZ/IVA had a mean decrease in lung clearance index 2.5 of 2.29 units (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.97-2.60) compared with 0.02 units (95% CI, -0.29 to 0.34) in children given placebo (between-group treatment difference, -2.26 units; 95% CI, -2.71 to -1.81; P < 0.0001). ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment also led to improvements in the secondary endpoint of sweat chloride concentration (between-group treatment difference, -51.2 mmol/L; 95% CI, -55.3 to -47.1) and in the other endpoints of percent predicted FEV 1 (between-group treatment difference, 11.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.9-15.1) and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory domain score (between-group treatment difference, 5.5 points; 95% CI, 1.0-10.0) compared with placebo from baseline through Week 24. The most common adverse events in children receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA were headache and cough (30.0% and 23.3%, respectively); most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions: In this first randomized, controlled study of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator conducted in children 6 through 11 years of age with F /MF genotypes, ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment led to significant improvements in lung function, as well as robust improvements in respiratory symptoms and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function. ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated in this pediatric population with no new safety findings.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""37951948\"">Title: Lung SORT LNPs enable precise homology-directed repair mediated CRISPR/Cas genome correction in cystic fibrosis models.\nAuthors: Wei, Tuo, Sun, Yehui, Cheng, Qiang et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Nature communications\nAbstract: Approximately 10% of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, particularly those with CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene nonsense mutations, lack effective treatments. The potential of gene correction therapy through delivery of the CRISPR/Cas system to CF-relevant organs/cells is hindered by the lack of efficient genome editor delivery carriers. Herein, we report improved Lung Selective Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (SORT LNPs) for efficient delivery of Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and donor ssDNA templates, enabling precise homology-directed repair-mediated gene correction in CF models. Optimized Lung SORT LNPs deliver mRNA to lung basal cells in Ai9 reporter mice. SORT LNP treatment successfully corrected the CFTR mutations in homozygous G542X mice and in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial cells with homozygous F508del mutations, leading to the restoration of CFTR protein expression and chloride transport function. This proof-of-concept study will contribute to accelerating the clinical development of mRNA LNPs for CF treatment through CRISPR/Cas gene correction.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n我找到了一个非常相关的临床试验（PMID: 31679946），它直接比较了Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor三联疗法与Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor双联疗法在F508del纯合子患者中的疗效。但我需要更多关于肺功能（ppFEV1）和肺部急性加重事件的具体数据。让我进行第二次搜索（2/3），专注于寻找关于肺部急性加重事件的数据。\n\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor pulmonary exacerbation F508del</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 57 results.

Respiratory medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe goal of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators is to reach normal CFTR function in people with cystic fibrosis. Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor restored CFTR function in vitro and in phase 2 trials in participants aged 18 years and older resulting in improvements in CFTR function, as measured by sweat chloride concentrations and lung function as measured by spirometry. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor compared with standard of care elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older.\nMETHODS\nIn two randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trials, individuals aged 12 years and older with stable cystic fibrosis with F508del-minimal function (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-102) or with F508del-F508del, F508del-residual function, F508del-gating, or elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-responsive-non-F508del genotypes (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-103) were enrolled at 126 and 159 international sites, respectively. Eligible individuals were entered into a 4-week run-in period, during which they received elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening. They were then randomly assigned (1:1) to either elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening, or vanzacaftor (20 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and deutivacaftor (250 mg once daily) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning, for the 52-week treatment period. All participants received matching placebo tablets to maintain the treatment blinding. Randomisation was done using an interactive web-response system and stratified by age, FEV 1 % predicted, sweat chloride concentration, and previous CFTR modulator use, and also by genotype for Trial VX20-121-103. The primary endpoint for both trials was absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline (most recent value before treatment on day 1) through week 24 (with non-inferiority of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor shown if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the primary endpoint was -3·0 or higher). Efficacy was assessed in all participants with the intended CFTR genotype who were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least one dose of study treatment during the treatment period. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug during the treatment period. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05033080 (Trial VX20-121-102) and NCT05076149 (Trial VX20-121-103), and are now complete.\nFINDINGS\nIn Trial VX20-121-102 between Sept 14, 2021, and Oct 18, 2022, 488 individuals were screened, of whom 435 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 398 were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=202) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=196). Median age was 31·0 years (IQR 22·6-38·5), 163 (41%) of 398 participants were female, 235 (59%) were male, and 388 (97%) were White. In Trial VX20-121-103, between Oct 27, 2021, and Oct 26, 2022, 699 individuals were screened, of whom 597 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 573 participants were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=289) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=284). Median age was 33·1 years (IQR 24·5-42·2), 280 (49%) of 573 participants were female, 293 (51%) were male, and 532 (93%) were White. The absolute change in least squares mean FEV 1 % predicted from baseline through week 24 for Trial VX20-121-102 was 0·5 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·3 (0·3) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference of 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·7 to 1·1]; p<0·0001), and for Trial VX20-121-103, was 0·2 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·0 (0·2) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·5 to 0·9]; p<0·0001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with the most common being infective pulmonary exacerbation (133 [28%] of 480 participants in the pooled vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group vs 158 [32%] of 491 in the pooled elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group), cough (108 [23%] vs 101 [21%]), COVID-19 (107 [22%] vs 127 [26%]), and nasopharyngitis (102 [21%] vs 95 [19%]).\nINTERPRETATION\nVanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor is non-inferior to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in terms of FEV 1 % predicted, and is safe and well tolerated. Once daily dosing with vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor reduces treatment burden, potentially improving adherence, compared with the twice daily regimen of the current standard of care.

The aim of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in these patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this phase 3, open-label, single-arm extension study, participants with F508del -minimal function (from a 24-week parent study; n=399) or F508del - F508del (from a 4-week parent study; n=107) genotypes receive ELX/TEZ/IVA at the same dose (ELX 200 mg once daily, TEZ 100 mg once daily and IVA 150 mg every 12 h). The primary end-point is safety and tolerability. A prespecified interim analysis was conducted when the last participant reached the Week 144 visit.\nRESULTS\nAt the Week 144 interim analysis, mean duration of exposure to ELX/TEZ/IVA in the extension study was 151.1 weeks. Exposure-adjusted rates of adverse events (AEs) (586.6 events per 100 participant-years) and serious AEs (22.4 events per 100 participant-years) were lower than in the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group in the 24-week parent study (1096.0 and 36.9 events per 100 participant-years, respectively); most participants had AEs classified as mild (16.4% of participants) or moderate (60.3% of participants) in severity. 14 participants (2.8%) had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA, participants had increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) percentage predicted, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score and body mass index, and had decreases in sweat chloride concentration and pulmonary exacerbation rates that were maintained over the interim analysis period. The mean annualised rate of change in FEV 1 % pred was +0.07 (95% CI -0.12-0.26) percentage points among the participants.\nCONCLUSIONS\nELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the 24-week parent study. Participants had sustained improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, CF transmembrane conductance regulator function, pulmonary exacerbation rates and nutritional status.

However, effects of ETI on downstream consequences of CFTR dysfunction, i.e. abnormal viscoelastic properties of airway mucus, chronic airway infection and inflammation have not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine the longitudinal effects of ETI on airway mucus rheology, microbiome and inflammation in CF patients with one or two F508del alleles aged ≥12 years throughout the first 12 months of therapy.\nMETHODS\nIn this prospective observational study, we assessed sputum rheology, the microbiome, inflammation markers and proteome before and 1, 3 and 12 months after initiation of ETI.\nRESULTS\nIn total, 79 patients with CF and at least one F508del allele and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. ETI improved the elastic modulus and viscous modulus of CF sputum at 3 and 12 months after initiation (all p<0.01). Furthermore, ETI decreased the relative abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF sputum at 3 months and increased the microbiome α-diversity at all time points .

CFTR modulators, which were developed in the past decade, partially restore CFTR protein function. Their clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials, particularly in terms of lung function and pulmonary exacerbations, nutritional status, and quality of life in people with gating mutations (ivacaftor), homozygous for the F508del mutation (lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor), and in those with at least one F508del mutation (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). However, many questions remain regarding their long-term safety and effectiveness, particularly in patients with advanced lung disease, liver disease, renal insufficiency, or problematic bacterial colonization. The impact of CFTR modulators on other important outcomes such as concurrent treatments, lung transplantation, chest imaging, or pregnancies also warrants further investigation. The French CF Reference Network includes 47 CF centers that contribute patient data to the comprehensive French CF Registry and have conducted nationwide real-world studies on CFTR modulators. This review seeks to summarize the results of these real-world studies and examine their findings against those of randomized control trials.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34268058\"">Title: A Review of Trikafta: Triple Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulator Therapy.\nAuthors: Zaher, Anas, ElSaygh, Jude, Elsori, Dalal et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Cureus\nAbstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially fatal genetic disease that causes serious lung damage. With time, researchers have a more complete understanding of the molecular-biological defects that underlie CF. This knowledge is leading to alternative approaches regarding the treatment of this condition. Trikafta is the third FDA-approved drug that targets the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene. The drug is a combination of three individual drugs which are elexacaftor (ELX), tezacaftor (TEZ), and ivacaftor (IVA). This trio increases the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and reduces the mortality and morbidity rates in CF patients. The effectiveness of Trikafta, seen in clinical trials, outperforms currently available therapies in terms of lung function, quality of life, sweat chloride reduction, and pulmonary exacerbation reduction. The safety and efficacy of CFTR modulators in children with CF have also been studied. Continued evaluation of patient data is needed to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy. In this study, we will focus on reviewing data from clinical trials regarding the benefits of CFTR modulator therapy. We address the impact of Trikafta on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life. Adverse events of the different CFTR modulators are discussed.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""36535667\"">Title: CFTR Modulators: Current Status and Evolving Knowledge.\nAuthors: Regard, Lucile, Martin, Clémence, Da Silva, Jennifer et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: In the past decade, the medical management of people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) has changed with the development of small molecules that partially restore the function of the defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and are called CFTR modulators. Ivacaftor (IVA), a CFTR potentiator with a large effect on epithelial ion transport, was the first modulator approved in pwCF carrying gating mutations. Because IVA was unable to restore sufficient CFTR function in pwCF with other mutations, two CFTR correctors (lumacaftor and tezacaftor) were developed and used in combination with IVA in pwCF homozygous for F508del, the most common CFTR variant. However, LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA were only moderately effective in F508del homozygous pwCF and had no efficacy in those with F508del and minimal function mutations. Elexacaftor, a second-generation corrector, was thus developed and combined to tezacaftor and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) to target pwCF with at least one F508del variant, corresponding to approximately 85% of pwCF. Both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA are considered highly effective modulator therapies (HEMTs) in eligible pwCF and are now approved for nearly 90% of the CF population over 6 years of age. HEMTs are responsible for rapid improvement in respiratory manifestations, including improvement in symptoms and lung function, and reduction in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations. The impact of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations of CF is less well established, although significant weight gain and improvement in quality of life have been demonstrated. Recent clinical trials and real-world studies suggest that benefits of HEMT could even prove greater when used earlier in life (i.e., in younger children and infants). This article shortly reviews the past 10 years of development and use of CFTR modulators. Effects of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations and on CF demographics are also discussed.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""29126871\"">Title: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis and advanced lung disease homozygous for F508del-CFTR.\nAuthors: Taylor-Cousar, Jennifer L, Jain, Manu, Barto, Tara Lynn et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nEvaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with severe lung disease.\nMETHODS\nPatients with CF 12 years of age and older, homozygous for F508del-CFTR, with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1 ) <40 received lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250mg every 12h (full dose) for 24weeks in an open-label, prospective study (NCT02390219). Dose modification to half dose for 1-2weeks (including at initiation) was permitted. Safety and tolerability were the primary outcome measures; clinical outcomes were also assessed.\nRESULTS\nOf 46 patients (initiated on full dose: n=28; initiated on half dose: n=18), 35 (76%) completed 24weeks of treatment. The most common adverse events included infective pulmonary exacerbation, abnormal respiration, cough, and dyspnea. Compared with patients initiating on full dose, patients initiating at half dose had less frequent respiratory events (56% vs 71%) of shorter median duration (4 vs 9days). No dose modifications or discontinuations as a result of respiratory events occurred in patients initiating on half dose who were then increased to the full dose over 2weeks (versus three each for patients on full dose). Following an initial reduction, ppFEV 1 was similar to baseline from week 4 throughout the remainder of the study (least squares mean [95% confidence interval] at week 24: -0.4 [-1.9, 1.1]; p=0.6249). Compared with the 24weeks prior to study, the annualized hospitalization rate was lower (rate ratio: 0.41; p=0.00026) and the duration of intravenous antibiotics was shorter (mean [standard deviation] difference: -8.52 [24.91] days; p=0.0369) through study week 24.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with patients with higher lung function, respiratory events were more common in patients with ppFEV 1 <40; aside from these events, the lumacaftor/ivacaftor safety profile was consistent with previous studies. Results suggest that patients with ppFEV 1 <40 may benefit from treatment initiation at a lower dose with augmented monitoring before increasing to the full dose.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34784492\"">Title: Clinical Effectiveness of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in People with Cystic Fibrosis: A Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Nichols, David P, Paynter, Alex C, Heltshe, Sonya L et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: Rationale: The cystic fibrosis (CF) modulator drug, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), proved highly effective in controlled clinical trials for individuals with at least one F508del allele, which occurs in at least 85% of people with CF. Objectives: PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months' clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. Methods: Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms. Measurements and Main Results: Average age was 25.1 years, and 44.1% entered the study using tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor, whereas 6.7% were using ivacaftor, consistent with F508del homozygosity and G551D allele, respectively. At 6 months into ETI therapy, ppFEV 1 improved 9.76 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.76 to 10.76) from baseline, cystic fibrosis questionnaire-revised respiratory domain score improved 20.4 points (95% CI, 18.3 to 22.5), and sweat chloride decreased -41.7 mmol/L (95% CI, -43.8 to -39.6). BMI also significantly increased. Changes were larger in those naive to modulators but substantial in all groups, including those treated with ivacaftor at baseline. Conclusions: ETI by clinical prescription provided large improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and BMI in a diverse population naive to modulator drug therapy, using existing two-drug combinations, or using ivacaftor alone. Each group also experienced significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, which correlated with improved ppFEV 1 in the overall study population.

Absent or decreased function of the CFTR protein is associated with multiorgan dysfunction and shortened life expectancy.\nOBSERVATIONS\nCFTR is an anion channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Loss of function leads to obstructed exocrine glands. Of people with cystic fibrosis in the US, approximately 85.5% have the gene variant F508del. Manifestations of cystic fibrosis in patients with the F508del gene variant begin in infancy with steatorrhea, poor weight gain, and respiratory symptoms (coughing, wheezing). As people with cystic fibrosis age, chronic respiratory bacterial infections cause loss of lung function and bronchiectasis. With the availability of universal newborn screening in multiple countries including the US, many people with cystic fibrosis are asymptomatic at diagnosis. With multidisciplinary care teams that included dietitians, respiratory therapists, and social workers, treatment of cystic fibrosis can slow disease progression. Median survival has improved from 36.3 years (95% CI, 35.1-37.9) in 2006 to 53.1 years (95% CI, 51.6-54.7) in 2021. Pulmonary therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis consist of mucolytics (eg, dornase alfa), anti-inflammatories (eg, azithromycin), and antibiotics (such as tobramycin delivered by a nebulizer). Four small molecular therapies, termed CFTR modulators, that facilitate CFTR production and/or function have received regulatory approval. Examples are ivacaftor and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. For example, in patients with 1 F508del variant, the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor improved lung function from -0.2% in the placebo group to 13.6% (difference, 13.8%; 95% CI, 12.1%-15.4%) and decreased the annualized estimated rate of pulmonary exacerbations from 0.98 to 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55). Improved respiratory function and symptoms have lasted up to 144 weeks in postapproval observational studies. An additional 177 variants are eligible for treatment with the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination.\nCONCLUSION\nCystic fibrosis affects approximately 89 000 people worldwide and is associated with a spectrum of disease related to exocrine dysfunction, including chronic respiratory bacterial infections and reduced life expectancy. First-line pulmonary therapies consist of mucolytics, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics, and approximately 90% of people with cystic fibrosis who are 2 years or older may benefit from a combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""31679946\"">Title: Efficacy and safety of the elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor combination regimen in people with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation: a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.\nAuthors: Heijerman, Harry G M, McKone, Edward F, Downey, Damian G et al. | Year: 2019 | Journal: Lancet (London, England)\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators correct the basic defect caused by CFTR mutations.

The elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group had improvements in the primary outcome of ppFEV 1 (least squares mean [LSM] treatment difference of 10·0 percentage points [95% CI 7·4 to 12·6], p<0·0001) and the key secondary outcomes of sweat chloride concentration (LSM treatment difference -45·1 mmol/L [95% CI -50·1 to -40·1], p<0·0001), and CFQ-R RD score (LSM treatment difference 17·4 points [95% CI 11·8 to 23·0], p<0·0001) compared with the tezacaftor plus ivacaftor group. The triple combination regimen was well tolerated, with no discontinuations. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; serious adverse events occurred in two (4%) participants receiving elexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor and in one (2%) receiving tezacaftor plus ivacaftor.\nINTERPRETATION\nElexacaftor plus tezacaftor plus ivacaftor provided clinically robust benefit compared with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor alone, with a favourable safety profile, and shows the potential to lead to transformative improvements in the lives of people with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the F508del mutation.\nFUNDING\nVertex Pharmaceuticals.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34782259\"">Title: Complete CFTR gene sequencing in 5,058 individuals with cystic fibrosis informs variant-specific treatment.\nAuthors: Raraigh, Karen S, Aksit, Melis A, Hetrick, Kurt et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive condition caused by variants in each CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) allele. Clinically affected individuals without two identified causal variants typically have no further interrogation of CFTR beyond examination of coding regions, but the development of variant-specific CFTR-targeted treatments necessitates complete understanding of CFTR genotype.\nMETHODS\nWhole genome sequences were analyzed on 5,058 individuals with CF. We focused on the full CFTR gene sequence and identified disease-causing variants in three phases: screening for known and structural variants; discovery of novel loss-of-function variants; and investigation of remaining variants.\nRESULTS\nAll variants identified in the first two phases and coding region variants found in the third phase were interpreted according to CFTR2 or ACMG criteria (n = 371; 16 [4.3%] previously unreported). Full gene sequencing enabled delineation of 18 structural variants (large insertions or deletions), of which two were novel. Additional CFTR variants of uncertain effect were found in 76 F508del homozygotes and in 21 individuals with other combinations of CF-causing variants. Both causative variants were identified in 98.1% (n = 4,960) of subjects, an increase of 2.3 percentage points from the 95.8% (n = 4,847) who had a registry- or chart-reported disease-causing CFTR genotype. Of the remaining 98 individuals, 78 carried one variant that has been associated with CF (CF-causing [n = 70] or resulting in varying clinical consequences n = 8]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nComplete CFTR gene sequencing in 5,058 individuals with CF identified at least one DNA variant in 99.6% of the cohort that is targetable by current molecular or emerging gene-based therapeutic technologies.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""35816621\"">Title: Efficacy and Safety of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in Children 6 Through 11 Years of Age with Cystic Fibrosis Heterozygous for F508del and a Minimal Function Mutation: A Phase 3b, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study.\nAuthors: Mall, Marcus A, Brugha, Rossa, Gartner, Silvia et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: Rationale: The triple-combination regimen elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) was shown to be safe and efficacious in children aged 6 through 11 years with cystic fibrosis and at least one F508del-CFTR allele in a phase 3, open-label, single-arm study. Objectives: To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA in children 6 through 11 years of age with cystic fibrosis heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function CFTR mutation ( F /MF genotypes) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3b trial. Methods: Children were randomized to receive either ELX/TEZ/IVA ( n = 60) or placebo ( n = 61) during a 24-week treatment period. The dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA administered was based on weight at screening, with children <30 kg receiving ELX 100 mg once daily, TEZ 50 mg once daily, and IVA 75 mg every 12 hours, and children ⩾30 kg receiving ELX 200 mg once daily, TEZ 100 mg once daily, and IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (adult dose). Measurements and Main Results: The primary endpoint was absolute change in lung clearance index 2.5 from baseline through Week 24. Children given ELX/TEZ/IVA had a mean decrease in lung clearance index 2.5 of 2.29 units (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.97-2.60) compared with 0.02 units (95% CI, -0.29 to 0.34) in children given placebo (between-group treatment difference, -2.26 units; 95% CI, -2.71 to -1.81; P < 0.0001). ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment also led to improvements in the secondary endpoint of sweat chloride concentration (between-group treatment difference, -51.2 mmol/L; 95% CI, -55.3 to -47.1) and in the other endpoints of percent predicted FEV 1 (between-group treatment difference, 11.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.9-15.1) and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory domain score (between-group treatment difference, 5.5 points; 95% CI, 1.0-10.0) compared with placebo from baseline through Week 24. The most common adverse events in children receiving ELX/TEZ/IVA were headache and cough (30.0% and 23.3%, respectively); most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions: In this first randomized, controlled study of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator conducted in children 6 through 11 years of age with F /MF genotypes, ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment led to significant improvements in lung function, as well as robust improvements in respiratory symptoms and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function.

The potential of gene correction therapy through delivery of the CRISPR/Cas system to CF-relevant organs/cells is hindered by the lack of efficient genome editor delivery carriers. Herein, we report improved Lung Selective Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (SORT LNPs) for efficient delivery of Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and donor ssDNA templates, enabling precise homology-directed repair-mediated gene correction in CF models. Optimized Lung SORT LNPs deliver mRNA to lung basal cells in Ai9 reporter mice. SORT LNP treatment successfully corrected the CFTR mutations in homozygous G542X mice and in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial cells with homozygous F508del mutations, leading to the restoration of CFTR protein expression and chloride transport function. This proof-of-concept study will contribute to accelerating the clinical development of mRNA LNPs for CF treatment through CRISPR/Cas gene correction.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n我找到了一个非常相关的临床试验（PMID: 31679946），它直接比较了Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor三联疗法与Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor双联疗法在F508del纯合子患者中的疗效。但我需要更多关于肺功能（ppFEV1）和肺部急性加重事件的具体数据。让我进行第二次搜索（2/3），专注于寻找关于肺部急性加重事件的数据。\n\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor pulmonary exacerbation F508del</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 57 results.

Absent or decreased function of the CFTR protein is associated with multiorgan dysfunction and shortened life expectancy.\nOBSERVATIONS\nCFTR is an anion channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Loss of function leads to obstructed exocrine glands. Of people with cystic fibrosis in the US, approximately 85.5% have the gene variant F508del. Manifestations of cystic fibrosis in patients with the F508del gene variant begin in infancy with steatorrhea, poor weight gain, and respiratory symptoms (coughing, wheezing). As people with cystic fibrosis age, chronic respiratory bacterial infections cause loss of lung function and bronchiectasis. With the availability of universal newborn screening in multiple countries including the US, many people with cystic fibrosis are asymptomatic at diagnosis. With multidisciplinary care teams that included dietitians, respiratory therapists, and social workers, treatment of cystic fibrosis can slow disease progression. Median survival has improved from 36.3 years (95% CI, 35.1-37.9) in 2006 to 53.1 years (95% CI, 51.6-54.7) in 2021. Pulmonary therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis consist of mucolytics (eg, dornase alfa), anti-inflammatories (eg, azithromycin), and antibiotics (such as tobramycin delivered by a nebulizer). Four small molecular therapies, termed CFTR modulators, that facilitate CFTR production and/or function have received regulatory approval. Examples are ivacaftor and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. For example, in patients with 1 F508del variant, the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor improved lung function from -0.2% in the placebo group to 13.6% (difference, 13.8%; 95% CI, 12.1%-15.4%) and decreased the annualized estimated rate of pulmonary exacerbations from 0.98 to 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55). Improved respiratory function and symptoms have lasted up to 144 weeks in postapproval observational studies. An additional 177 variants are eligible for treatment with the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination.\nCONCLUSION\nCystic fibrosis affects approximately 89 000 people worldwide and is associated with a spectrum of disease related to exocrine dysfunction, including chronic respiratory bacterial infections and reduced life expectancy. First-line pulmonary therapies consist of mucolytics, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics, and approximately 90% of people with cystic fibrosis who are 2 years or older may benefit from a combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""39756424\"">Title: Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor versus elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older (SKYLINE Trials VX20-121-102 and VX20-121-103): results from two randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 trials.\nAuthors: Keating, Claire, Yonker, Lael M, Vermeulen, François et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: The Lancet. Respiratory medicine\nAbstract: BACKGROUND\nThe goal of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators is to reach normal CFTR function in people with cystic fibrosis. Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor restored CFTR function in vitro and in phase 2 trials in participants aged 18 years and older resulting in improvements in CFTR function, as measured by sweat chloride concentrations and lung function as measured by spirometry. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor compared with standard of care elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in individuals with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years and older.\nMETHODS\nIn two randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trials, individuals aged 12 years and older with stable cystic fibrosis with F508del-minimal function (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-102) or with F508del-F508del, F508del-residual function, F508del-gating, or elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor-responsive-non-F508del genotypes (SKYLINE Trial VX20-121-103) were enrolled at 126 and 159 international sites, respectively. Eligible individuals were entered into a 4-week run-in period, during which they received elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening. They were then randomly assigned (1:1) to either elexacaftor (200 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and ivacaftor (150 mg once every 12 h) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet in the evening, or vanzacaftor (20 mg once daily), tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), and deutivacaftor (250 mg once daily) as two fixed-dose combination tablets in the morning, for the 52-week treatment period. All participants received matching placebo tablets to maintain the treatment blinding. Randomisation was done using an interactive web-response system and stratified by age, FEV 1 % predicted, sweat chloride concentration, and previous CFTR modulator use, and also by genotype for Trial VX20-121-103. The primary endpoint for both trials was absolute change in FEV 1 % predicted from baseline (most recent value before treatment on day 1) through week 24 (with non-inferiority of vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor shown if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the primary endpoint was -3·0 or higher). Efficacy was assessed in all participants with the intended CFTR genotype who were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least one dose of study treatment during the treatment period. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug during the treatment period. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05033080 (Trial VX20-121-102) and NCT05076149 (Trial VX20-121-103), and are now complete.\nFINDINGS\nIn Trial VX20-121-102 between Sept 14, 2021, and Oct 18, 2022, 488 individuals were screened, of whom 435 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 398 were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=202) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=196). Median age was 31·0 years (IQR 22·6-38·5), 163 (41%) of 398 participants were female, 235 (59%) were male, and 388 (97%) were White. In Trial VX20-121-103, between Oct 27, 2021, and Oct 26, 2022, 699 individuals were screened, of whom 597 entered the 4-week run-in period, and subsequently 573 participants were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (n=289) or vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor (n=284). Median age was 33·1 years (IQR 24·5-42·2), 280 (49%) of 573 participants were female, 293 (51%) were male, and 532 (93%) were White. The absolute change in least squares mean FEV 1 % predicted from baseline through week 24 for Trial VX20-121-102 was 0·5 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·3 (0·3) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference of 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·7 to 1·1]; p<0·0001), and for Trial VX20-121-103, was 0·2 (SE 0·3) percentage points in the vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group versus 0·0 (0·2) percentage points in the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group (least squares mean treatment difference 0·2 percentage points [95% CI -0·5 to 0·9]; p<0·0001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with the most common being infective pulmonary exacerbation (133 [28%] of 480 participants in the pooled vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor group vs 158 [32%] of 491 in the pooled elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor group), cough (108 [23%] vs 101 [21%]), COVID-19 (107 [22%] vs 127 [26%]), and nasopharyngitis (102 [21%] vs 95 [19%]).\nINTERPRETATION\nVanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor is non-inferior to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor in terms of FEV 1 % predicted, and is safe and well tolerated. Once daily dosing with vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor reduces treatment burden, potentially improving adherence, compared with the twice daily regimen of the current standard of care.

The aim of this study is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA in these patients.\nMETHODS\nIn this phase 3, open-label, single-arm extension study, participants with F508del -minimal function (from a 24-week parent study; n=399) or F508del - F508del (from a 4-week parent study; n=107) genotypes receive ELX/TEZ/IVA at the same dose (ELX 200 mg once daily, TEZ 100 mg once daily and IVA 150 mg every 12 h). The primary end-point is safety and tolerability. A prespecified interim analysis was conducted when the last participant reached the Week 144 visit.\nRESULTS\nAt the Week 144 interim analysis, mean duration of exposure to ELX/TEZ/IVA in the extension study was 151.1 weeks. Exposure-adjusted rates of adverse events (AEs) (586.6 events per 100 participant-years) and serious AEs (22.4 events per 100 participant-years) were lower than in the ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment group in the 24-week parent study (1096.0 and 36.9 events per 100 participant-years, respectively); most participants had AEs classified as mild (16.4% of participants) or moderate (60.3% of participants) in severity. 14 participants (2.8%) had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA, participants had increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) percentage predicted, Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score and body mass index, and had decreases in sweat chloride concentration and pulmonary exacerbation rates that were maintained over the interim analysis period. The mean annualised rate of change in FEV 1 % pred was +0.07 (95% CI -0.12-0.26) percentage points among the participants.\nCONCLUSIONS\nELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the 24-week parent study. Participants had sustained improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, CF transmembrane conductance regulator function, pulmonary exacerbation rates and nutritional status.

CFTR modulators, which were developed in the past decade, partially restore CFTR protein function. Their clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials, particularly in terms of lung function and pulmonary exacerbations, nutritional status, and quality of life in people with gating mutations (ivacaftor), homozygous for the F508del mutation (lumacaftor/ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor), and in those with at least one F508del mutation (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). However, many questions remain regarding their long-term safety and effectiveness, particularly in patients with advanced lung disease, liver disease, renal insufficiency, or problematic bacterial colonization. The impact of CFTR modulators on other important outcomes such as concurrent treatments, lung transplantation, chest imaging, or pregnancies also warrants further investigation. The French CF Reference Network includes 47 CF centers that contribute patient data to the comprehensive French CF Registry and have conducted nationwide real-world studies on CFTR modulators. This review seeks to summarize the results of these real-world studies and examine their findings against those of randomized control trials.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34268058\"">Title: A Review of Trikafta: Triple Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulator Therapy.\nAuthors: Zaher, Anas, ElSaygh, Jude, Elsori, Dalal et al. | Year: 2021 | Journal: Cureus\nAbstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially fatal genetic disease that causes serious lung damage. With time, researchers have a more complete understanding of the molecular-biological defects that underlie CF. This knowledge is leading to alternative approaches regarding the treatment of this condition. Trikafta is the third FDA-approved drug that targets the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene. The drug is a combination of three individual drugs which are elexacaftor (ELX), tezacaftor (TEZ), and ivacaftor (IVA). This trio increases the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and reduces the mortality and morbidity rates in CF patients. The effectiveness of Trikafta, seen in clinical trials, outperforms currently available therapies in terms of lung function, quality of life, sweat chloride reduction, and pulmonary exacerbation reduction. The safety and efficacy of CFTR modulators in children with CF have also been studied. Continued evaluation of patient data is needed to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy. In this study, we will focus on reviewing data from clinical trials regarding the benefits of CFTR modulator therapy. We address the impact of Trikafta on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life.

Ivacaftor (IVA), a CFTR potentiator with a large effect on epithelial ion transport, was the first modulator approved in pwCF carrying gating mutations. Because IVA was unable to restore sufficient CFTR function in pwCF with other mutations, two CFTR correctors (lumacaftor and tezacaftor) were developed and used in combination with IVA in pwCF homozygous for F508del, the most common CFTR variant. However, LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA were only moderately effective in F508del homozygous pwCF and had no efficacy in those with F508del and minimal function mutations. Elexacaftor, a second-generation corrector, was thus developed and combined to tezacaftor and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) to target pwCF with at least one F508del variant, corresponding to approximately 85% of pwCF. Both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA are considered highly effective modulator therapies (HEMTs) in eligible pwCF and are now approved for nearly 90% of the CF population over 6 years of age. HEMTs are responsible for rapid improvement in respiratory manifestations, including improvement in symptoms and lung function, and reduction in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations. The impact of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations of CF is less well established, although significant weight gain and improvement in quality of life have been demonstrated. Recent clinical trials and real-world studies suggest that benefits of HEMT could even prove greater when used earlier in life (i.e., in younger children and infants). This article shortly reviews the past 10 years of development and use of CFTR modulators. Effects of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations and on CF demographics are also discussed.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""29126871\"">Title: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis and advanced lung disease homozygous for F508del-CFTR.\nAuthors: Taylor-Cousar, Jennifer L, Jain, Manu, Barto, Tara Lynn et al. | Year: 2018 | Journal: Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society\nAbstract: OBJECTIVE\nEvaluation of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with severe lung disease.\nMETHODS\nPatients with CF 12 years of age and older, homozygous for F508del-CFTR, with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1 ) <40 received lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250mg every 12h (full dose) for 24weeks in an open-label, prospective study (NCT02390219). Dose modification to half dose for 1-2weeks (including at initiation) was permitted. Safety and tolerability were the primary outcome measures; clinical outcomes were also assessed.\nRESULTS\nOf 46 patients (initiated on full dose: n=28; initiated on half dose: n=18), 35 (76%) completed 24weeks of treatment. The most common adverse events included infective pulmonary exacerbation, abnormal respiration, cough, and dyspnea. Compared with patients initiating on full dose, patients initiating at half dose had less frequent respiratory events (56% vs 71%) of shorter median duration (4 vs 9days). No dose modifications or discontinuations as a result of respiratory events occurred in patients initiating on half dose who were then increased to the full dose over 2weeks (versus three each for patients on full dose). Following an initial reduction, ppFEV 1 was similar to baseline from week 4 throughout the remainder of the study (least squares mean [95% confidence interval] at week 24: -0.4 [-1.9, 1.1]; p=0.6249). Compared with the 24weeks prior to study, the annualized hospitalization rate was lower (rate ratio: 0.41; p=0.00026) and the duration of intravenous antibiotics was shorter (mean [standard deviation] difference: -8.52 [24.91] days; p=0.0369) through study week 24.\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with patients with higher lung function, respiratory events were more common in patients with ppFEV 1 <40; aside from these events, the lumacaftor/ivacaftor safety profile was consistent with previous studies. Results suggest that patients with ppFEV 1 <40 may benefit from treatment initiation at a lower dose with augmented monitoring before increasing to the full dose.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""34784492\"">Title: Clinical Effectiveness of Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor in People with Cystic Fibrosis: A Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Nichols, David P, Paynter, Alex C, Heltshe, Sonya L et al. | Year: 2022 | Journal: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine\nAbstract: Rationale: The cystic fibrosis (CF) modulator drug, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), proved highly effective in controlled clinical trials for individuals with at least one F508del allele, which occurs in at least 85% of people with CF. Objectives: PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months' clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. Methods: Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms. Measurements and Main Results: Average age was 25.1 years, and 44.1% entered the study using tezacaftor/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor, whereas 6.7% were using ivacaftor, consistent with F508del homozygosity and G551D allele, respectively. At 6 months into ETI therapy, ppFEV 1 improved 9.76 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.76 to 10.76) from baseline, cystic fibrosis questionnaire-revised respiratory domain score improved 20.4 points (95% CI, 18.3 to 22.5), and sweat chloride decreased -41.7 mmol/L (95% CI, -43.8 to -39.6). BMI also significantly increased. Changes were larger in those naive to modulators but substantial in all groups, including those treated with ivacaftor at baseline. Conclusions: ETI by clinical prescription provided large improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, and BMI in a diverse population naive to modulator drug therapy, using existing two-drug combinations, or using ivacaftor alone. Each group also experienced significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, which correlated with improved ppFEV 1 in the overall study population.

Loss of function leads to obstructed exocrine glands. Of people with cystic fibrosis in the US, approximately 85.5% have the gene variant F508del. Manifestations of cystic fibrosis in patients with the F508del gene variant begin in infancy with steatorrhea, poor weight gain, and respiratory symptoms (coughing, wheezing). As people with cystic fibrosis age, chronic respiratory bacterial infections cause loss of lung function and bronchiectasis. With the availability of universal newborn screening in multiple countries including the US, many people with cystic fibrosis are asymptomatic at diagnosis. With multidisciplinary care teams that included dietitians, respiratory therapists, and social workers, treatment of cystic fibrosis can slow disease progression. Median survival has improved from 36.3 years (95% CI, 35.1-37.9) in 2006 to 53.1 years (95% CI, 51.6-54.7) in 2021. Pulmonary therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis consist of mucolytics (eg, dornase alfa), anti-inflammatories (eg, azithromycin), and antibiotics (such as tobramycin delivered by a nebulizer). Four small molecular therapies, termed CFTR modulators, that facilitate CFTR production and/or function have received regulatory approval. Examples are ivacaftor and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. For example, in patients with 1 F508del variant, the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor improved lung function from -0.2% in the placebo group to 13.6% (difference, 13.8%; 95% CI, 12.1%-15.4%) and decreased the annualized estimated rate of pulmonary exacerbations from 0.98 to 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55).

Ivacaftor (IVA), a CFTR potentiator with a large effect on epithelial ion transport, was the first modulator approved in pwCF carrying gating mutations. Because IVA was unable to restore sufficient CFTR function in pwCF with other mutations, two CFTR correctors (lumacaftor and tezacaftor) were developed and used in combination with IVA in pwCF homozygous for F508del, the most common CFTR variant. However, LUM/IVA and TEZ/IVA were only moderately effective in F508del homozygous pwCF and had no efficacy in those with F508del and minimal function mutations. Elexacaftor, a second-generation corrector, was thus developed and combined to tezacaftor and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) to target pwCF with at least one F508del variant, corresponding to approximately 85% of pwCF. Both IVA and ELX/TEZ/IVA are considered highly effective modulator therapies (HEMTs) in eligible pwCF and are now approved for nearly 90% of the CF population over 6 years of age. HEMTs are responsible for rapid improvement in respiratory manifestations, including improvement in symptoms and lung function, and reduction in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations. The impact of HEMT on extrapulmonary manifestations of CF is less well established, although significant weight gain and improvement in quality of life have been demonstrated. Recent clinical trials and real-world studies suggest that benefits of HEMT could even prove greater when used earlier in life (i.e., in younger children and infants).

Objectives: PROMISE is a postapproval study to understand the broad effects of ETI through 30 months' clinical use in a more diverse U.S. patient population with planned analyses after 6 months. Methods: Prospective, observational study in 487 people with CF age 12 years or older with at least one F508del allele starting ETI for the first time. Assessments occurred before and 1, 3, and 6 months into ETI therapy. Outcomes included change in percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ), sweat chloride concentration, body mass index (BMI), and self-reported respiratory symptoms.
