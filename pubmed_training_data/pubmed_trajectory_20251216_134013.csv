Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40621323\"">Title: A Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-amyloid Monoclonal Antibodies in Alzheimer's Disease.\nAuthors: Chundu, Umesh C, Thiriveedhi, Sree Ram, Bhatti, Chetanya et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Cureus\nAbstract: Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies targeting amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques have gained prominence over the past decade as potential disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to major regulatory approvals and global debate. Nonetheless, the central question persists: does this emerging therapy have a justified role in the treatment protocol for AD? This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of these agents across phase II and III clinical trials conducted in the past decade (2014-2024), aligning with the timeline when disease-modifying therapies gained momentum. A systematic search was performed across PubMed and the Cochrane Library to identify phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between January 2014 and December 2024. The inclusion criteria focused on studies that evaluated cognitive outcomes using scales such as the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Additionally, trials assessing biomarkers, including CSF measures and PET imaging, were included. Safety outcomes, particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were also systematically analyzed. Due to heterogeneity in outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Lecanemab reduced amyloid burden with 81% of patients achieving amyloid-negative PET scans (Clarity AD trial) and showed a 27% reduction in cognitive decline on the ADCOMS scale. While statistically significant, the 27% ADCOMS (Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score) reduction warrants comparison to MCID (minimal clinically important difference) thresholds (e.g., ~0.5-1.0 points for CDR-SB in early AD) to assess real-world impact. Donanemab demonstrated 76% plaque clearance and a 35% slowing in cognitive decline in early AD patients. Aducanumab showed dose-dependent effects on plaque clearance but had inconsistent cognitive outcomes and higher ARIA rates. Recent mAb trials provide promising evidence for disease modification in early AD stages, particularly with lecanemab and donanemab. However, variability in cognitive outcomes and safety concerns warrant cautious interpretation and long-term validation.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>第一次检索未返回关键的 Clarity AD 主试验（NEJM）论文。我将用更聚焦的关键词检索 van Dyck（Clarity AD）以获取对应 PMID 和 18 个月 CDR-SB 与 ARIA 数据（第2次检索/最多3次）。</think>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">van Dyck lecanemab 2023 NEJM</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 3 results.

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.

Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes.\nRESULTS\nAmong 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.02 (95% CI, -7.01 to -5.03) in the donanemab group and -9.27 (95% CI, -10.23 to -8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and -10.2 (95% CI, -11.22 to -9.16) with donanemab and -13.1 (95% CI, -14.10 to -12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P < .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45]; P < .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40063015\"">Title: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities With Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.\nAuthors: Zimmer, Jennifer A, Ardayfio, Paul, Wang, Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThese prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38581616\"">Title: Donanemab in Japanese Patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease: Subpopulation Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Trial.\nAuthors: Sato, Shoichiro, Hatakeyama, Naohisa, Fujikoshi, Shinji et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Neurology and therapy\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nDonanemab, a monoclonal antibody directed against an insoluble, modified, N-terminal truncated form of amyloid beta, demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with early, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial. Here, we report clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and safety results for the Japanese subpopulation.\nMETHODS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (N = 1736) was conducted in eight countries, including Japan (enrollment June 2020-November 2021; database lock April 2023). Participants (60-85 years) with early, symptomatic AD (mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia), Mini-Mental State Examination score 20-28, and confirmed amyloid and tau pathology were randomized 1:1 (stratified by tau status) to intravenous donanemab (700 mg for three doses, then 1400 mg/dose) or placebo every 4 weeks for 72 weeks. Primary outcome was change from baseline to week 76 in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score. Other outcomes included clinical measures of cognitive and functional impairment, biomarkers, and safety.\nRESULTS\nOf 88 Japanese participants (43 placebo, 45 donanemab), 7 in each group discontinued. Least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in iADRS score at week 76 was smaller with donanemab than with placebo in the combined (low-medium tau and high tau) and low-medium tau (N = 76) subpopulations (LSM change difference: 4.43 and 3.99, representing 38.8% and 40.2% slowing of disease progression, respectively). Slowing of AD progression with donanemab was also observed for other clinical outcomes. Marked decreases in amyloid plaque and plasma phosphorylated tau 217 were observed; amyloid clearance (< 24.1 Centiloids) was observed in 83.3% of the combined donanemab and 0% of the combined placebo groups. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema/effusions occurred in ten (22.2%) donanemab-treated participants (one [2.2%] symptomatic) and one (2.3%) placebo-treated participant.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe overall efficacy and safety of donanemab in Japanese participants were similar to the global TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""36891463\"">Title: Meaningful Clinical Changes in Alzheimer Disease Measured With the iADRS and Illustrated Using the Donanemab TRAILBLAZER-ALZ Study Findings.\nAuthors: Wessels, Alette M, Dennehy, Ellen B, Dowsett, Sherie A et al. | Year: 2023 | Journal: Neurology. Clinical practice\nAbstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW\nTo provide relevant background of the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), with examples, to assist the reader with the interpretation of iADRS findings from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study.\nRECENT FINDINGS\nThe iADRS is an integrated measure of global Alzheimer disease (AD) severity for use in the clinical trial environment. It provides a single score that captures commonalities across cognitive and functional ability domains, reflecting disease-related impairment, while minimizing noise not related to disease progression that may exist within each domain. In AD, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are expected to slow the rate of clinical decline, changing the trajectory of disease progression. The overall percent slowing of disease progression with treatment is a more informative outcome of effect than absolute point differences between treatment and placebo groups at any given time point because the latter is influenced by treatment period and disease severity. The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial was a phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donanemab in participants with early symptomatic AD; the primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to 76 weeks on the iADRS. In the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, donanemab slowed disease progression by 32% at 18 months ( p = 0.04 vs placebo), demonstrating clinical efficacy. At the patient level, one can assess whether the DMT effect is clinically meaningful by estimating the threshold of change consistent with clinically meaningful worsening; based on the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ findings, treatment with donanemab would delay reaching this threshold by approximately 6 months.\nSUMMARY\nThe iADRS is capable of accurately describing clinical changes associated with disease progression and detecting treatment effects and is an effective assessment tool for use in clinical trials of individuals with early symptomatic AD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""41082199\"">Title: Posttreatment Amyloid Levels and Clinical Outcomes Following Donanemab for Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Lu, Ming, Kim, Min Jung, Collins, Emily C et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAccumulation of amyloid plaque drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Reduction of amyloid via amyloid-targeting therapies may result in clinical benefit.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the correlation of posttreatment amyloid levels with clinical outcomes and biomarkers in AD.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis was a post hoc exploratory analysis from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, conducted June 2020 through April 2023 at 277 medical research centers/hospitals in 8 countries. A total of 8240 participants aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic AD with amyloid and tau pathology based on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 6504 participants were excluded predominantly due to inadequate amyloid or tau pathology. The current analysis included 1582 participants (766 in the donanemab group and 816 in the placebo group) with baseline and at least 1 posttreatment assessment. Data analysis took place from July 2024 to March 2025.\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first 3 doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks, with outcomes assessed through 76 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nParticipants were categorized into 1 of 10 groups (deciles) based on their lowest amyloid value observed posttreatment. Clinical progression was assessed via changes in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Plasma biomarkers measured included phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Correlations between the median amyloid level in each decile were assessed with 76-week least-squares mean changes in each outcome and biomarker.\nRESULTS\nAnalyses included 1582 participants, including 766 treated with donanemab and 816 with placebo. The mean (SD) age was 72.9 (6.2) years, and 900 participants (56.9%) were female. Participants who received donanemab had lower posttreatment amyloid values than those in the placebo group. Across the trial population, lower posttreatment amyloid levels were correlated with slower clinical progression as measured by iADRS score (R2, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]) and CDR-SB score (R2, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.70-0.97]) and with decreases in p-tau217 (R2, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-0.97]), p-tau181 (R2, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.77-0.97]), and GFAP (R2, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.97]). There was no correlation between posttreatment amyloid value and NfL (R2, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00-0.54]).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe findings in this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial demonstrating a correlation between posttreatment amyloid plaque level and clinical benefit support amyloid plaque removal as the mechanism of action for donanemab treatment and the level of amyloid plaque as a potential surrogate biomarker in amyloid-targeting therapies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n以下均来自两项“关键”随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验在约18个月/76周时点的主要/关键次要结局与安全性报告（并列出相对安慰剂的“减缓幅度”与 ARIA 发生率）。由于两药并无头对头RCT，数值仅能做**跨试验对照**。\n\n---\n\n## 1) lecanemab（CLARITY-AD，18个月）\n关键III期：*Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer’s Disease*（NEJM 2023）PMID: **36449413**  \n\n### CDR-SB：18个月的减缓幅度\n- 18个月 CDR-SB 从基线的调整后LS均值变化：  \n  -

Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks. ARIA events and infusion-related reactions occurred less commonly with lecanemab in the Asian region subgroup than the overall population.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40621323\"">Title: A Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-amyloid Monoclonal Antibodies in Alzheimer's Disease.\nAuthors: Chundu, Umesh C, Thiriveedhi, Sree Ram, Bhatti, Chetanya et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: Cureus\nAbstract: Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies targeting amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques have gained prominence over the past decade as potential disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to major regulatory approvals and global debate. Nonetheless, the central question persists: does this emerging therapy have a justified role in the treatment protocol for AD? This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of these agents across phase II and III clinical trials conducted in the past decade (2014-2024), aligning with the timeline when disease-modifying therapies gained momentum. A systematic search was performed across PubMed and the Cochrane Library to identify phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between January 2014 and December 2024. The inclusion criteria focused on studies that evaluated cognitive outcomes using scales such as the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Additionally, trials assessing biomarkers, including CSF measures and PET imaging, were included. Safety outcomes, particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were also systematically analyzed. Due to heterogeneity in outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Lecanemab reduced amyloid burden with 81% of patients achieving amyloid-negative PET scans (Clarity AD trial) and showed a 27% reduction in cognitive decline on the ADCOMS scale. While statistically significant, the 27% ADCOMS (Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score) reduction warrants comparison to MCID (minimal clinically important difference) thresholds (e.g., ~0.5-1.0 points for CDR-SB in early AD) to assess real-world impact. Donanemab demonstrated 76% plaque clearance and a 35% slowing in cognitive decline in early AD patients. Aducanumab showed dose-dependent effects on plaque clearance but had inconsistent cognitive outcomes and higher ARIA rates. Recent mAb trials provide promising evidence for disease modification in early AD stages, particularly with lecanemab and donanemab. However, variability in cognitive outcomes and safety concerns warrant cautious interpretation and long-term validation.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<think>第一次检索未返回关键的 Clarity AD 主试验（NEJM）论文。我将用更聚焦的关键词检索 van Dyck（Clarity AD）以获取对应 PMID 和 18 个月 CDR-SB 与 ARIA 数据（第2次检索/最多3次）。</think>\n<call_tool name=\""pubmed_search\"" limit=\""5\"">van Dyck lecanemab 2023 NEJM</call_tool>\n<tool_output>\nFound 3 results.

Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease.

Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes.\nRESULTS\nAmong 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.02 (95% CI, -7.01 to -5.03) in the donanemab group and -9.27 (95% CI, -10.23 to -8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and -10.2 (95% CI, -11.22 to -9.16) with donanemab and -13.1 (95% CI, -14.10 to -12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P < .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.40]; P < .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, -0.7 [95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45]; P < .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nAmong participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""40063015\"">Title: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities With Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.\nAuthors: Zimmer, Jennifer A, Ardayfio, Paul, Wang, Hong et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThese prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.\nINTERVENTIONS\nPlacebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.\nRESULTS\nAcross 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATIONS\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT03367403 and NCT04437511.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""38581616\"">Title: Donanemab in Japanese Patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease: Subpopulation Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Trial.\nAuthors: Sato, Shoichiro, Hatakeyama, Naohisa, Fujikoshi, Shinji et al. | Year: 2024 | Journal: Neurology and therapy\nAbstract: INTRODUCTION\nDonanemab, a monoclonal antibody directed against an insoluble, modified, N-terminal truncated form of amyloid beta, demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with early, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial. Here, we report clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and safety results for the Japanese subpopulation.\nMETHODS\nTRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (N = 1736) was conducted in eight countries, including Japan (enrollment June 2020-November 2021; database lock April 2023). Participants (60-85 years) with early, symptomatic AD (mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia), Mini-Mental State Examination score 20-28, and confirmed amyloid and tau pathology were randomized 1:1 (stratified by tau status) to intravenous donanemab (700 mg for three doses, then 1400 mg/dose) or placebo every 4 weeks for 72 weeks. Primary outcome was change from baseline to week 76 in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score. Other outcomes included clinical measures of cognitive and functional impairment, biomarkers, and safety.\nRESULTS\nOf 88 Japanese participants (43 placebo, 45 donanemab), 7 in each group discontinued. Least-squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in iADRS score at week 76 was smaller with donanemab than with placebo in the combined (low-medium tau and high tau) and low-medium tau (N = 76) subpopulations (LSM change difference: 4.43 and 3.99, representing 38.8% and 40.2% slowing of disease progression, respectively). Slowing of AD progression with donanemab was also observed for other clinical outcomes. Marked decreases in amyloid plaque and plasma phosphorylated tau 217 were observed; amyloid clearance (< 24.1 Centiloids) was observed in 83.3% of the combined donanemab and 0% of the combined placebo groups.

It provides a single score that captures commonalities across cognitive and functional ability domains, reflecting disease-related impairment, while minimizing noise not related to disease progression that may exist within each domain. In AD, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are expected to slow the rate of clinical decline, changing the trajectory of disease progression. The overall percent slowing of disease progression with treatment is a more informative outcome of effect than absolute point differences between treatment and placebo groups at any given time point because the latter is influenced by treatment period and disease severity. The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial was a phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donanemab in participants with early symptomatic AD; the primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to 76 weeks on the iADRS. In the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, donanemab slowed disease progression by 32% at 18 months ( p = 0.04 vs placebo), demonstrating clinical efficacy. At the patient level, one can assess whether the DMT effect is clinically meaningful by estimating the threshold of change consistent with clinically meaningful worsening; based on the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ findings, treatment with donanemab would delay reaching this threshold by approximately 6 months.\nSUMMARY\nThe iADRS is capable of accurately describing clinical changes associated with disease progression and detecting treatment effects and is an effective assessment tool for use in clinical trials of individuals with early symptomatic AD.</snippet>\n<snippet id=\""41082199\"">Title: Posttreatment Amyloid Levels and Clinical Outcomes Following Donanemab for Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: A Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.\nAuthors: Lu, Ming, Kim, Min Jung, Collins, Emily C et al. | Year: 2025 | Journal: JAMA neurology\nAbstract: IMPORTANCE\nAccumulation of amyloid plaque drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Reduction of amyloid via amyloid-targeting therapies may result in clinical benefit.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the correlation of posttreatment amyloid levels with clinical outcomes and biomarkers in AD.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis was a post hoc exploratory analysis from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, conducted June 2020 through April 2023 at 277 medical research centers/hospitals in 8 countries. A total of 8240 participants aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic AD with amyloid and tau pathology based on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 6504 participants were excluded predominantly due to inadequate amyloid or tau pathology. The current analysis included 1582 participants (766 in the donanemab group and 816 in the placebo group) with baseline and at least 1 posttreatment assessment. Data analysis took place from July 2024 to March 2025.\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first 3 doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks, with outcomes assessed through 76 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nParticipants were categorized into 1 of 10 groups (deciles) based on their lowest amyloid value observed posttreatment. Clinical progression was assessed via changes in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Plasma biomarkers measured included phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Correlations between the median amyloid level in each decile were assessed with 76-week least-squares mean changes in each outcome and biomarker.\nRESULTS\nAnalyses included 1582 participants, including 766 treated with donanemab and 816 with placebo. The mean (SD) age was 72.9 (6.2) years, and 900 participants (56.9%) were female. Participants who received donanemab had lower posttreatment amyloid values than those in the placebo group. Across the trial population, lower posttreatment amyloid levels were correlated with slower clinical progression as measured by iADRS score (R2, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]) and CDR-SB score (R2, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.70-0.97]) and with decreases in p-tau217 (R2, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-0.97]), p-tau181 (R2, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.77-0.97]), and GFAP (R2, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.97]). There was no correlation between posttreatment amyloid value and NfL (R2, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00-0.54]).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe findings in this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial demonstrating a correlation between posttreatment amyloid plaque level and clinical benefit support amyloid plaque removal as the mechanism of action for donanemab treatment and the level of amyloid plaque as a potential surrogate biomarker in amyloid-targeting therapies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511.</snippet>\n</tool_output>\n<answer>\n以下均来自两项“关键”随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验在约18个月/76周时点的主要/关键次要结局与安全性报告（并列出相对安慰剂的“减缓幅度”与 ARIA 发生率）。由于两药并无头对头RCT，数值仅能做**跨试验对照**。\n\n---\n\n## 1) lecanemab（CLARITY-AD，18个月）\n关键III期：*Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer’s Disease*（NEJM 2023）PMID: **36449413**  \n\n### CDR-SB：18个月的减缓幅度\n- 18个月 CDR-SB 从基线的调整后LS均值变化：  \n  - lecanemab：**1.21**  \n  - placebo：**1.66**  \n- 组间差（lecanemab − placebo）：**−0.45 分**（95%CI −0.67 到 −0.23）  \n<cite id=\""36449413\"">CLARITY-AD：18个月CDR-SB变化 1.21 vs 1.66；差值−0.45</cite>\n\n（常被表述为约 27% slowing，但您问题要求“具体数值”，此处给出点差。）\n\n### ARIA 发生率（试验主论文中明确给出的关键值）\n- ARIA-E（edema/effusions）：**12.6%**（lecanemab组；论文摘要明确给出）  \n<cite id=\""36449413\"">CLARITY-AD：ARIA-E/effusion 12.6%</cite>\n\n> 说明：在 PMID 36449413 的摘要中，ARIA-H（microhemorrhage/ siderosis）总体发生率未在摘要段落直接列出；如需同一论文中 ARIA-H 的精确百分比，需要查看全文/表格（通常在安全性表格中按 ARIA-H、ARIA-E、症状性等分层呈现）。在本次仅能使用 PubMed 摘要输出的条件下，我只能对 lecanemab 的 ARIA-H 给出“该关键RCT摘要未直接提供数值”的如实结论。\n\n---\n\n## 2) donanemab（TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2，76周≈18个月）\n关键III期：*Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trial*（JAMA 2023）PMID: **37459141**\n\n### CDR-SB：76周（约18个月）的减缓幅度\n论文同时报告了低/中tau人群与合并总体人群；以下给出**合并总体（combined population）**，更接近“早期AD总体”：\n\n- 76周 CDR-SB 从基线的LS均值变化（combined population）：  \n  - donanemab：**1.72**  \n  - placebo：**2.42**  \n- 组间差（donanemab − placebo）：**−0.70 分**（95%CI −0.95 到 −0.45）  \n<cite id=\""37459141\"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2：76周CDR-SB变化 1.72 vs 2.42；差值−0.70（combined）</cite>\n\n（供参考：低/中tau人群差值为 −0.67；同文亦有给出。）  \n<cite id=\""37459141\"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2：低/中tau人群CDR-SB差值−0.67</cite>\n\n### ARIA 发生率（JAMA 主论文摘要直接给出的为 ARIA-E；ARIA-H未在摘要中给出）\n- ARIA-E（edema/effusion）：**24.0%**（donanemab） vs **2.1%**（placebo）  \n  - 其中 symptomatic ARIA-E：**52例**（donanemab组；摘要提供例数）  \n<cite id=\""37459141\"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2：ARIA-E 24.0% vs 2.1%，symptomatic ARIA-E 52例</cite>\n\n> 同 lecanemab 一样：PMID 37459141 的摘要并未列出 ARIA-H 的总体发生率百分比；ARIA-H 的详细发生率通常在全文安全性表格/补充材料中。\n\n---\n\n## 3) 按您的问题做“并列比较"", ""tool_calls"": [{""tool_name"": ""pubmed_search"", ""parameters"": {""limit"": 5}, ""query"": ""lecanemab CLARITY-AD CDR-SB ARIA"", ""result"": {""total"": 2, ""data"": [{""paperId"": ""40189473"", ""title"": ""Clarity AD: Asian regional analysis of a phase III trial of lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease."", ""abstract"": ""BACKGROUND\nAcross Asia, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is expected to rise dramatically due to, among other factors, rapidly aging populations. Alzheimer's disease pathology is triggered by the accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated Aβ peptides (oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils). Lecanemab is a recently approved humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (oligomers, protofibrils), with activity at insoluble fibrils. In the recent 18-month phase 3 Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated a consistent slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, functional, and quality of life) outcomes, and reduction in brain amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Clarity AD, with an increase in incidence of infusion related reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) versus placebo.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objective of this manuscript is to present the results for the Asian region population of Clarity AD.\nDESIGN\nThe core Clarity AD study was an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.\nSETTING\nAcademic and clinical centers in Asia PARTICIPANTS: A total of 294 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease).\nINTERVENTION\nEligible patients were randomized across 2 treatment groups (placebo and lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly) according to a fixed 1:1 schedule.\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe primary efficacy endpoint in the core study was change in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) from baseline at 18 months. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months in amyloid PET Centiloids (in patients participating in the amyloid PET sub-study), AD COMposite Score (ADCOMS) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14). Safety was monitored throughout the study in a blinded manner by the sponsor and in an unblinded manner by an independent data safety monitoring committee.\nRESULTS\nOf the total of 1795 subjects randomized in Clarity AD, 294 subjects were in the Asian region (Japan:152; Korea:129; Singapore:13). The efficacy of lecanemab was consistent with the overall population. For the primary endpoint, there was a slowing of decline with lecanemab in the CDR-SB at 18 months compared to placebo in the Asian region (adjusted mean difference: -0.349; 95 % confidence intervals: -0.773, 0.076; 24 % slowing of decline). Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints also favored lecanemab versus placebo in Asians. Lecanemab was well tolerated in Asian subjects, with a safety profile in Asian subjects similar to the overall Clarity AD population. The most common adverse events of special interest were ARIA-H (lecanemab:14.4 %; placebo:16.2 %), ARIA-E (lecanemab:6.2 %; placebo:1.4 %), and infusion-related reactions (lecanemab:12.3 %; placebo:1.4 %). Incidence of adverse events leading to study drug dose interruption or withdrawal, infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E and ARIA-H was lower for the lecanemab treated group in the Asian region relative to the overall Clarity AD population. Results from quality of life and biomarker assessments in the Asia region were also generally similar to the overall Clarity AD population.\nCONCLUSION\nIn the Clarity AD Asian region cohort, the overall efficacy, biomarker changes and safety profile of lecanemab were consistent with the overall population, with a favorable risk-benefit profile and manageable risks.

Nonetheless, the central question persists: does this emerging therapy have a justified role in the treatment protocol for AD? This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of these agents across phase II and III clinical trials conducted in the past decade (2014-2024), aligning with the timeline when disease-modifying therapies gained momentum. A systematic search was performed across PubMed and the Cochrane Library to identify phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between January 2014 and December 2024. The inclusion criteria focused on studies that evaluated cognitive outcomes using scales such as the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Additionally, trials assessing biomarkers, including CSF measures and PET imaging, were included. Safety outcomes, particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were also systematically analyzed. Due to heterogeneity in outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Lecanemab reduced amyloid burden with 81% of patients achieving amyloid-negative PET scans (Clarity AD trial) and showed a 27% reduction in cognitive decline on the ADCOMS scale. While statistically significant, the 27% ADCOMS (Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score) reduction warrants comparison to MCID (minimal clinically important difference) thresholds (e.g., ~0.5-1.0 points for CDR-SB in early AD) to assess real-world impact. Donanemab demonstrated 76% plaque clearance and a 35% slowing in cognitive decline in early AD patients. Aducanumab showed dose-dependent effects on plaque clearance but had inconsistent cognitive outcomes and higher ARIA rates.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores indicate greater impairment).\nRESULTS\nA total of 1795 participants were enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events.

The overall percent slowing of disease progression with treatment is a more informative outcome of effect than absolute point differences between treatment and placebo groups at any given time point because the latter is influenced by treatment period and disease severity. The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial was a phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donanemab in participants with early symptomatic AD; the primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to 76 weeks on the iADRS. In the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, donanemab slowed disease progression by 32% at 18 months ( p = 0.04 vs placebo), demonstrating clinical efficacy. At the patient level, one can assess whether the DMT effect is clinically meaningful by estimating the threshold of change consistent with clinically meaningful worsening; based on the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ findings, treatment with donanemab would delay reaching this threshold by approximately 6 months.\nSUMMARY\nThe iADRS is capable of accurately describing clinical changes associated with disease progression and detecting treatment effects and is an effective assessment tool for use in clinical trials of individuals with early symptomatic AD."", ""year"": ""2023"", ""venue"": ""Neurology.

Reduction of amyloid via amyloid-targeting therapies may result in clinical benefit.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo assess the correlation of posttreatment amyloid levels with clinical outcomes and biomarkers in AD.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis was a post hoc exploratory analysis from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, conducted June 2020 through April 2023 at 277 medical research centers/hospitals in 8 countries. A total of 8240 participants aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic AD with amyloid and tau pathology based on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 6504 participants were excluded predominantly due to inadequate amyloid or tau pathology. The current analysis included 1582 participants (766 in the donanemab group and 816 in the placebo group) with baseline and at least 1 posttreatment assessment. Data analysis took place from July 2024 to March 2025.\nINTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first 3 doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks, with outcomes assessed through 76 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nParticipants were categorized into 1 of 10 groups (deciles) based on their lowest amyloid value observed posttreatment. Clinical progression was assessed via changes in integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Plasma biomarkers measured included phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Correlations between the median amyloid level in each decile were assessed with 76-week least-squares mean changes in each outcome and biomarker.\nRESULTS\nAnalyses included 1582 participants, including 766 treated with donanemab and 816 with placebo. The mean (SD) age was 72.9 (6.2) years, and 900 participants (56.9%) were female. Participants who received donanemab had lower posttreatment amyloid values than those in the placebo group. Across the trial population, lower posttreatment amyloid levels were correlated with slower clinical progression as measured by iADRS score (R2, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]) and CDR-SB score (R2, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.70-0.97]) and with decreases in p-tau217 (R2, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-0.97]), p-tau181 (R2, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.77-0.97]), and GFAP (R2, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-0.97]). There was no correlation between posttreatment amyloid value and NfL (R2, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00-0.54]).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe findings in this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial demonstrating a correlation between posttreatment amyloid plaque level and clinical benefit support amyloid plaque removal as the mechanism of action for donanemab treatment and the level of amyloid plaque as a potential surrogate biomarker in amyloid-targeting therapies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04437511."", ""year"": ""2025"", ""venue"": ""JAMA neurology""}]}, ""timestamp"": ""2025-12-16T13:39:21.687639""}], ""final_answer"": ""以下均来自两项“关键”随机、双盲、安慰剂对照试验在约18个月/76周时点的主要/关键次要结局与安全性报告（并列出相对安慰剂的“减缓幅度”与 ARIA 发生率）。由于两药并无头对头RCT，数值仅能做**跨试验对照**。\n\n---\n\n## 1) lecanemab（CLARITY-AD，18个月）\n关键III期：*Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer’s Disease*（NEJM 2023）PMID: **36449413**  \n\n### CDR-SB：18个月的减缓幅度\n- 18个月 CDR-SB 从基线的调整后LS均值变化：  \n  - lecanemab：**1.21**  \n  - placebo：**1.66**  \n- 组间差（lecanemab − placebo）：**−0.45 分**（95%CI −0.67 到 −0.23）  \n<cite id=\""36449413\"">CLARITY-AD：18个月CDR-SB变化 1.21 vs 1.66；差值−0.45</cite>\n\n（常被表述为约 27% slowing，但您问题要求“具体数值”，此处给出点差。）\n\n### ARIA 发生率（试验主论文中明确给出的关键值）\n- ARIA-E（edema/effusions）：**12.6%**（lecanemab组；论文摘要明确给出）  \n<cite id=\""36449413\"">CLARITY-AD：ARIA-E/effusion 12.6%</cite>\n\n> 说明：在 PMID 36449413 的摘要中，ARIA-H（microhemorrhage/ siderosis）总体发生率未在摘要段落直接列出；如需同一论文中 ARIA-H 的精确百分比，需要查看全文/表格（通常在安全性表格中按 ARIA-H、ARIA-E、症状性等分层呈现）。在本次仅能使用 PubMed 摘要输出的条件下，我只能对 lecanemab 的 ARIA-H 给出“该关键RCT摘要未直接提供数值”的如实结论。\n\n---\n\n## 2) donanemab（TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2，76周≈18个月）\n关键III期：*Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trial*（JAMA 2023）PMID: **37459141**\n\n### CDR-SB：76周（约18个月）的减缓幅度\n论文同时报告了低/中tau人群与合并总体人群；以下给出**合并总体（combined population）**，更接近“早期AD总体”：\n\n- 76周 CDR-SB 从基线的LS均值变化（combined population）：  \n  - donanemab：**1.72**  \n  - placebo：**2.42**  \n- 组间差（donanemab − placebo）：**−0.70 分**（95%CI −0.95 到 −0.45）  \n<cite id=\""37459141\"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2：76周CDR-SB变化 1.72 vs 2.42；差值−0.70（combined）</cite>\n\n（供参考：低/中tau人群差值为 −0.67；同文亦有给出。）  \n<cite id=\""37459141\"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2：低/中tau人群CDR-SB差值−0.67</cite>\n\n### ARIA 发生率（JAMA 主论文摘要直接给出的为 ARIA-E；ARIA-H未在摘要中给出）\n- ARIA-E（edema/effusion）：**24.0%**（donanemab） vs **2.1%**（placebo）  \n  - 其中 symptomatic ARIA-E：**52例**（donanemab组；摘要提供例数）  \n<cite id=\""37459141\"">TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2：ARIA-E 24.0% vs 2.1%，symptomatic ARIA-E 52例</cite>\n\n> 同 lecanemab 一样：PMID 37459141 的摘要并未列出 ARIA-H 的总体发生率百分比；ARIA-H 的详细发生率通常在全文安全性表格/补充材料中。\n\n---\n\n## 3) 按您的问题做“并列比较"", ""pmids_cited"": [""37459141"", ""36449413""], ""total_tool_calls"": 3, ""tools_used"": [""pubmed_search""]}",pubmed_trajectory
