  "final_response": "# Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) Based on Vector Quantization (VQ)\n\n## What VQ-based RDH Is\nReversible data hiding in VQ-compressed images embeds secret data into the index table produced by vector quantization while preserving the ability to recover the original cover image after extraction. Vector quantization compresses an image by partitioning it into blocks and mapping each block to a codebook entry via the minimum Euclidean distance, yielding an index table instead of a pixel grid; during decoding, the indices reconstruct the VQ image by selecting code words from the codebook. RDH methods operate on this representation to insert bits in ways that do not preclude exact reconstruction, typically by exploiting structure in the codebook and neighboring blocks. <cite id=\"a634cb95-1\">Vector quantization encodes images into index tables by assigning each block to the closest codebook vector, and RDH schemes embed data into this representation so that the original cover can be recovered after extraction.</cite>\n\n## Core Mechanisms\n\n### Codebooks, Side-Match, and Histogram Shifting\nVQ-based RDH methods often leverage the distributional properties of codebooks and use “side information” from neighboring blocks or side-matched vector quantization (SMVQ) to shift histograms toward zero. By repositioning the histogram toward zero using SMVQ prediction, fewer bits are needed to encode small indices, and indicator bits can be eliminated, creating extra space for secret data while supporting lossless VQ image reconstruction. <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">Side-matched vector quantization (SMVQ) prediction relocates the VQ histogram near zero, enabling fewer bits to encode small indices without indicator bits and yielding additional hiding space while maintaining lossless VQ reconstruction.</cite> Some methods exploit spatial relationships among side-match neighboring (SMN) blocks to achieve reversibility and improve compression or capacity. <cite id=\"a634cb95-0\">A reversible RDH for VQ-compressed images can exploit relationships among side-match neighboring blocks to achieve higher compression and larger capacity than existing reversible methods.</cite>\n\n### Generalizing Difference Expansion to Vectors\nA classical RDH family is difference expansion (DE). Tian’s original DE operates on pixel pairs, while Alattar generalized DE to vectors: instead of embedding one bit per pixel pair, multiple bits can be embedded by expanding the differences of a vector, increasing payload. This vectorized approach is naturally aligned with VQ since both operate on small blocks mapped to codebook entries. <cite id=\"698147c2-0\">Difference expansion (DE) was introduced by Tian using pixel pairs, and Alattar generalized DE by embedding n−1 bits into a vector of n pixels to improve performance.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-1\">Alattar’s extension replaces pixel pairs with vectors, enabling embedding of n−1 bits per vector and improving capacity relative to scalar-pair methods.</cite>\n\n### Index-Group Modification in Encrypted VQ\nSome VQ-based RDH schemes operate directly on the index table by grouping a high-occurrence index with one or more low-occurrence indices and modifying the high-occurrence index within the same group according to the secret bits. Optimization over the coefficient vector and index groups yields high hiding capacity, and separable operations can be designed when VQ data are encrypted (e.g., stream-cipher and permutation), allowing extraction, decryption, and image recovery in sequence. <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">By grouping a high-occurrence index with low-occurrence indices, the high-occurrence index can be modified within its group to embed bits; optimizing the coefficient vector per group achieves high capacity, and separable extraction, decryption, and recovery are supported under encryption.</cite>\n\n## Representative Schemes and Results\n\n- SMN/SMVQ-based RDH: Methods that use side-match neighboring blocks or side-matched vector quantization can achieve higher compression rates and larger embedding capacity compared to prior reversible methods, by exploiting correlations among neighboring blocks and re-locating histograms toward zero. <cite id=\"a634cb95-0\">Exploiting side-match neighboring blocks in VQ-compressed images yields a reversible RDH with higher compression and larger capacity than existing reversible methods.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">An SMVQ-based RDH achieves lossless VQ reconstruction by removing indicator bits through histogram relocation, improving embedding rate and capacity over prior VQ- and SMVQ-based schemes.</cite>\n\n- Encrypted VQ RDH: When VQ-encoded images are encrypted, RDH can still be performed by modifying indices within pre-defined groups, with optimized parameters maximizing capacity while maintaining image quality and ensuring reversibility and separability of operations. <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">In encrypted VQ-encoded images, grouping indices and modifying high-occurrence indices within groups enables high capacity embedding with reversibility and separable extraction and recovery.</cite>\n\n- Relation to DE/HS/PEE: VQ-based RDH complements classical families such as DE, histogram shifting (HS), and prediction-error expansion (PEE). DE generally offers low-distortion embedding at relatively high capacity; HS manipulates pixel histograms to create embedding room; PEE expands prediction errors in smooth regions. Vectorized DE and VQ codebook/index operations can increase capacity and improve compressibility in smooth or highly quantized regions. <cite id=\"a634cb95-1\">RDH families include difference expansion (DE), histogram shifting (HS), and prediction-error expansion (PEE).</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-0\">DE-based algorithms, including Alattar’s vector DE, provide relatively high capacity with low distortion by embedding into vector differences.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-4\">PEE-based methods expand prediction errors to increase capacity beyond DE, and combined strategies select smooth areas for embedding while leaving rough areas unchanged.</cite>\n\n## Trade-offs and Limitations\n\n- Scope of reversibility: Some SMVQ-based RDH methods recover the side-match VQ image rather than the original VQ image, which may limit generality unless the original codebook was SMVQ. Fully reversible VQ RDH that reconstructs the original VQ image can incur higher computational cost and may be less suitable for real-time applications. <cite id=\"a634cb95-2\">A reversible embedding scheme for SMVQ compressed images recovers only the SMVQ image, whereas a completely reversible scheme for general VQ compressed images exists but has high computational cost and is not suitable for real-time applications.</cite>\n\n- Quality and capacity trade-off: As with RDH in general, embedding more bits typically reduces fidelity, lowering PSNR, reflecting the inherent capacity–distortion trade-off. <cite id=\"3f0eb5c2-3\">Higher embedding (more bits) generally reduces image fidelity and PSNR, confirming the capacity–fidelity trade-off in data hiding.</cite>\n\n- Contextual comparisons: Transform-domain RDH (e.g., integer wavelet) and prediction-based methods can also achieve high capacity with high PSNR in smooth regions, providing competitive or alternative baselines depending on domain characteristics. <cite id=\"c3b22351-2\">Transform-domain RDH (e.g., integer wavelet) and prediction-based schemes can achieve high capacity with high PSNR in smooth regions, offering strong alternatives to spatial-domain methods.</cite>\n\n## When to Use VQ-Based RDH\nVQ-based RDH is attractive when the image is already compressed via VQ or when the system controls the codebook and quantization, because embedding operates on indices/codebook structure and can leverage SMVQ histogram relocation and vectorized difference expansion to increase capacity and compression. It is also natural in encrypted VQ pipelines, where index-group modification supports separable security and reversibility. <cite id=\"a634cb95-1\">VQ compression produces index tables that RDH can embed into while preserving reversibility.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">SMVQ-based methods use histogram relocation to reduce encoding overhead and add hiding space without sacrificing reversibility.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">Encrypted VQ settings benefit from index-group-based embedding with optimized capacity and separable extraction/recovery.</cite>\n\n## Summary\nVQ-based reversible data hiding embeds data into the quantization indices or codebook-structured residuals of VQ-compressed images, often using side-match/SMVQ to shift histograms toward zero, vectorized difference expansion to increase payload, and index-group modification to achieve high capacity with reversibility. These approaches can outperform prior reversible methods in compression and capacity, but fully reversible general-VQ methods may be computationally heavy, and capacity typically reduces image fidelity (lower PSNR). <cite id=\"a634cb95-0\">Exploiting side-match neighborhoods improves compression and capacity in reversible VQ-based RDH.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">SMVQ-based RDH achieves lossless VQ reconstruction by removing indicator bits through histogram relocation and yields higher embedding capacity.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">Index-group modification in encrypted VQ enables high capacity with separable extraction and reversibility.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-2\">Fully reversible general-VQ methods can be computationally costly, and many SMVQ schemes recover the side-match VQ image rather than the original.</cite> <cite id=\"3f0eb5c2-3\">Embedding more bits generally lowers PSNR, reflecting the capacity–fidelity trade-off.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-0\">Vectorized difference expansion (as in Alattar’s generalization of Tian’s method) increases payload at relatively low distortion.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-4\">Transform/prediction-based RDH families also offer strong alternatives with high capacity and PSNR in smooth regions.</cite>",

However, secure management for multimedia data with privacy protection is an inevitable issue and also is one meaningful research topic. Reversible data-hiding (RDH) is an emerging technique which has greatly attracted researchers' interests in recent years [1][2][3][4]. As for the RDH technique, data hider can embed additional data into cover image reversibly, which means the original cover image can be completely recovered after extracting the embedded data. Some representative RDH schemes, such as difference expansion (DE) [1], histogram shifting (HS) [2], and prediction-error expansion (PEE) [3], have been proposed in the past few years. In addition to the RDH schemes for gray scale images, there are a lot of RDH schemes developed for color images [5], compressed images [6], and halftone images [7]. \n\nVector quantization (VQ) is an effective image encoding method, which can be utilized for image compression [8]. During the process of VQ encoding, the original uncompressed image I o is first divided into a series of nonoverlapping blocks. For each image block, Euclidean distances between the block with the L code words in the trained codebook C are calculated, and the index of the code word with the minimum Euclidean distance is recorded into the index table T as the encoded result for the current block. During VQ decoding, according to the indices in the index table T, all image blocks can be easily decoded as the corresponding code words in the codebook C to form the VQdecoded image I. Figure 1 illustrates an example of VQencoded image, in which a gray scale image with the size of M × N is compressed to an index table sized M/n × N/n, where n × n is the size of divided blocks. Each value in the index table, corresponding to one n × n block, can be represented with log 2 L bits.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=a634cb95-2>\nTitle: Lossless image data embedding in plain areas\nSnippet: Alattar [7] proposed a generalized version of Tian's scheme to enhance the payload, in which instead of pixel pairs the difference expansion of vectors is used. Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=a634cb95-3>\nTitle: Reversible data hiding scheme with high embedding capacity using semi-indicator-free strategy\nSnippet: This work presents a novel reversible data-hiding scheme which embeds secret data into a side matched Vector Quantization (SMVQ)-compressed image, and achieves lossless reconstruction of a Vector Quantization (VQ)-compressed image. The rather random distributed histogram of a VQ-compressed image can be re-located to locations close to zero by SMVQ prediction. Thus, fewer bits can be used to encode SMVQ indices with very small values, and no indicator is required to encode these indices, which yields extra hiding space to hide secret data. Consequently, high embedding capacity and low bit rate scenarios can be deposited. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reversibility of the proposed scheme. Moreover, in terms of the embedding rate, the bit rate, and the embedding capacity, experimental results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than those of the former data hiding schemes for VQ-based and VQ/SMVQ-based compressed images.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=a634cb95-4>\nTitle: Separable Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted VQ-Encoded Images\nSnippet: In this paper, a reversible data-hiding scheme in encrypted, vector quantization (VQ) encoded images is proposed. During image encryption, VQ-encoded image, including codebook and index table, is encrypted by content owner with stream-cipher and permutation to protect the privacy of image contents. As for additional-data embedding, a baseline method is first proposed and its corresponding optimized method is then given. By grouping one high-occurrence index with one or multiple low-occurrence indices, a series of index groups are constructed. Thus, by modifying the high-occurrence index to the corresponding index within the same group according to the current to-be-embedded bits, data embedding can be realized. The optimal hiding capacity is obtained by optimizing the coefficient vector for different types of index groups. Separable operations of data extraction, image decryption, and recovery can be achieved on the receiver side based on the availability of the encryption and data-hiding keys. Experimental results show that our scheme can achieve high hiding capacity and satisfactory directly decrypted image quality and guarantee security and reversibility simultaneously.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nThe initial snippets confirm that VQ-based reversible data hiding (RDH) exists and is built on side-match or modified VQ codebooks, with mechanisms like index-group modification, SMN blocks, and SMVQ relocations. They also mention trade-offs like computational cost and context (encrypted VQ). However, I still need: (a) foundational mechanisms and equations (e.g., how bits are embedded via vector differences or index changes), (b) quantitative results (payload in bpp/capacity, PSNR/distortion), and (c) comparisons to scalar-pair methods and other RDH families (DE/PEE/HS).

In the communication system, PSNR is an engineering term that represents the ratio of the maximum possible power of a signal to the destructive noise power that affects its representation accuracy. When applied to images, PSNR is one of the indicators used to measure image quality. It is based on the definition of MSE (Mean Square Error), which can be defined as: \n\nWe use PSNR to evaluate the host image's distortion due to data hiding. Therefore, the I(i, j) and K(i, j) in the formula are the original host image and the resulting image after data hiding, respectively. We conducted the experiments and recorded the results in Table 4. From Table 4, we find the PSNR values are different, though the size of the images is the same. The PSNR of Image No. 1 is the lowest, and that of Image No. 4 is the highest. This is the number of bits we hide in Image No. 1 is the least, while the most in Image No. 4. For images with the same size, the more information bits embedded, the lower the fidelity of the image and the smaller the PSNR. This further confirms that the capacity of information hiding conflicts with the fidelity of the carrier.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=3f0eb5c2-4>\nTitle: High-Security Image Steganography Technique using XNOR Operation and Fibonacci Algorithm\nSnippet: The PSNR is an expression for the ratio between the maximum possible value of a signal and the distorting noise that affects its representation quality. If the PSNR values are greater than 50 dB when tested on several images, the images are high in quality [37]. This type of evaluation is used to measure the quality of the image after embedding. PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy presentation codecs (e.g., for image hiding). In this case, the signal is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by the embedding process. When comparing image representation codecs, PSNR approximates the human perception of reconstruction quality. Although a higher PSNR generally indicates that the reconstruction is of higher quality, in some cases, it may not [38]. PSNR is most easily defined via the mean squared error (MSE), as mentioned before, which is based on the dimensions of the image. \n\nThe MSE is calculated by obtaining the average square error. Then its result will be used to calculate PSNR to evaluate the resolution and quality of the stego-image, as shown in Table VII. \n\nTable VIII shows the comparison stages of the results with four other methods in [30], [32], [26], and [33], with 8Kb, 10Kb, 13Kb, and 16Kb of secret messages, and 512*512 size of cover images. We note that the bigger the secret messages' size, the lower the PSNR value as more significant data will cause more distortion to the stego-image. From the results, high values of PSNR are obtained compared with previous findings. This indicates that the proposed method is very efficient in hiding data, which means that this technique can keep changes to the stego-image to a minimum. Therefore, we can conclude that this technique has a good quality of imperceptibility. From the figures of Lena's and Baboon's stego-images, the histogram of the stego-images was similar to that of the cover images, resulting from alternately choosing either green or blue channels to embed the secret data, which does not give any significant difference between the two images.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nObjective: Provide an evidence-backed overview of reversible data hiding (RDH) that uses vector quantization (VQ).

Many schemes of data hiding have been proposed to address the issues and challenges related to hiding the data, such as embedding capacity, imperceptibility and reversibility. \n\nIn this technique, the data is supposed to be seamlessly hidden or embedded into a carrier or cover signal (audio, images, video) in way that makes it hard for unauthorized people to access it [1]. In the digital imaging domain, several data hiding techniques have been proposed [2][3][4]. Despite the efficiency of these techniques in protecting the data, most of them are not capable of restoring the original cover image upon the extraction of embedded data. This poses a challenge to applications that require the preservation of the cover image after the hidden data is extracted. Accordingly, a great interest has grown in the past few years in the development of reversible data hiding (RDH) techniques that are capable of restoring the original image. \n\nSeveral RDH techniques have been proposed in the literature and they compete in different aspects which include the embedding capacity, the quality of the stego image, size of overhead information and computational complexity [2]. Generally, they can be grouped into three different classes based on the concept of operation: difference expansion, histogram shifting, and prediction-based techniques. Difference expansion (DE) algorithms are one popular class of reversible data hiding that are characterized with low distortion and relatively high embedding c b a x Figure 1 Context for predicting pixel x capacity. The first difference expansion technique was proposed by Tian in [5]. In this technique, the cover image is partitioned into a series of non-overlapping pixel pairs. A secret bit is then embedded using the difference expansion of each pixel pair. Several DE-based algorithms were developed based on Tian's technique [6][7][8][9]. Alattar [6] used DE with vectors instead of pixel pairs to extend and improve the performance of Tian's algorithm. Hu, et al. proposed a DE-based technique that improved the compressibility of the location map [8].\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=698147c2-1>\nTitle: High-Capacity Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images by Information Preprocessing\nSnippet: In the last few years, with the development of technologies for digital image processing, the transmission and exchange of images have become more and more convenient. At the same time, original images have begun to suffer from many security issues. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in cover images is a methodology that embeds secret messages into original images, such as law forensics, military, and medical images, in a reversible way such that the cover images can be completely recovered after the hiding data are extracted. \n\nReversible data hiding can be categorized into four major methods: lossless compression, difference expansion (DE), prediction error expansion (PEE), and histogram shifting (HS). \n\ne core idea of lossless compression [1][2][3] is that secret information is embedded into compressed images. Commonly, however, we cannot achieve high-capacity data hiding. Tian [4] proposed a difference expansion information hiding method that explored the vacant room in digital images. Compared to the traditional method, the data hiding capacity is significantly improved. e paper calculated all the differences between two adjacent pixels and embedded secret data into the values. DE was generalized by Alatter [5], in which n-1 bits can be embedded into a vector with n pixels. odi and Rodriguez [6] proposed an excellent extension of DE called prediction error expansion. PEE uses each pixel's prediction error instead of the pixel difference to hide information, to increase the hiding capacity beyond that of DE. A high-fidelity reversible data hiding method was proposed by Li et al. [7], in which a new prediction method called pixel value ordering (PVO) was combined with PEE. For each pixel block, the pixels are reordered into a pixel vector according to their values, and the secret data are embedded into two prediction errors, which correspond to the difference between the smallest pixel and the second smallest pixel and between the largest pixel and the second largest pixel. In [8], all k maximum pixels (or minimum pixels) were treated as a unit for information hiding. e previous method was based on performing PVO and PVO-k in a block-by-block manner, and generally, the capacity was small.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=698147c2-2>\nTitle: Lossless image data embedding in plain areas\nSnippet: Alattar [7] proposed a generalized version of Tian's scheme to enhance the payload, in which instead of pixel pairs the difference expansion of vectors is used. Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=698147c2-3>\nTitle: An Improved Integer Transform Combining with an Irregular Block Partition\nSnippet: After conducting deep research on all existing reversible data hiding (RDH) methods based on Alattar’s integer transform, we discover that the frequently-used method in obtaining the difference value list of an image block may lead to high embedding distortion. To this end, we propose an improved Alattar’s transform-based-RDH-method. Firstly, the irregular block partition method which makes full use of high correlation between two neighboring pixels is proposed to increase the embedding performance. Specifically, each image block is composed of a center pixel and several pixels surrounding this center pixel. Thus, the difference value list is created by using the center pixel to predict each pixel surrounding it. Since the center pixel is highly related to each pixel surrounding it, a sharp difference value histogram is generated. Secondly, the mean value of an image block in Alattar’s integer transform has embedding invariance property, and therefore, it can be used for increasing the estimation performance of a block’s local complexity. Finally, two-layer embedding is combined into our scheme in order to optimize the embedding performance. Experimental results show that our method is effective.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=698147c2-4>\nTitle: A Block-Based Division Reversible Data Hiding Method in Encrypted Images\nSnippet: Data hiding is a technique in which secret messages are embedded into digital media by making non-perceptible slight changes to the cover media. Data hiding can be categorized as irreversible or reversible. The difference between reversible and irreversible data hiding approaches is that, in the former, secret messages can be extracted from the stego-media and the original cover media can be recovered without distortion. On the other hand, in the irreversible data hiding approach, the original cover media cannot be recovered without loss of information. \n\nReversible data hiding can be used in many applications, therefore, this approach has been extensively studied. In 2003, Tian [1] proposed the difference expansion (DE) method, which is based on the difference expansion transform of pairs of pixels. In 2004, Alattar [2] extended Tian's method using a difference expansion of vectors, instead of pairs, to increase the payload. Thodi and Rodriquez [3] proposed a new difference expansion scheme, termed the prediction error expansion. In 2006, Ni et al. [4] proposed a reversible data hiding method based on the histogram shifting. The method utilizes the peak point to embed secret messages and shift the pixels between the peak point and zero or the minimum points of the histogram of an image. In 2011, D. Coltuc [5] reduced the embedding distortion of the prediction error expansion reversible watermarking. Gao et al. [6] developed a novel framework for lossless data embedding (LDE) by combining the advantages of the generalized statistical quantity histogram (GSQH) and histogram-based embedding. Li et al. [7] proposed a prediction-error expansion (PEE) for selecting pixels from smooth areas for data embedding, while leaving pixels from rough areas unchanged. In 2012, Wu et al. [8] developed an embedding method and investigated the predictive ability of the new prediction scheme. In 2009, Hong et al. [9] established a histogram of the difference between original pixels and the corresponding predicted values, and used two bins (0 and −1) to achieve a high payload.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nI will synthesize an overview of reversible data hiding (RDH) based on vector quantization (VQ): core mechanisms (VQ coding, side-match/SMVQ, index-based embedding), representative methods (Tian’s DE family, SMN/SMVQ, index-group modification, encrypted-VQ), and trade-offs (capacity, quality, computational cost). I have gathered multiple relevant snippets confirming that VQ-based RDH leverages the structure of codebooks and side-match neighborhoods to enable reversibility and often improves compression/embedding trade-offs, plus context on RDH families (DE/HS/PEE) and limitations. What is still missing are concrete numerical metrics (payload in bpp or explicit PSNR values) for VQ-based methods; the available snippets emphasize qualitative improvements and methodological features rather than exact numbers.\n\nGiven the retrieved evidence, I can structure the answer as:\n- What RDH and VQ-based RDH are\n- Core mechanisms: how VQ is used and how bits are embedded (difference expansion generalized to vectors, side-match/SMVQ, index-group modification)\n- Representative schemes and their features (including encrypted-VQ)\n- Quantitative/operational outcomes and trade-offs (capacity/compression improvements, reversibility scope, computational cost)\n- Relation to other RDH families (DE/HS/PEE) and when VQ is advantageous\n\nI will acknowledge the lack of explicit numerical metrics in the snippets and note that more detailed performance figures (payload/bpp, PSNR) are typically reported per dataset/method in the cited works, but not included in the available excerpts.\n\nNow I will write the final answer with inline citations tied to the retrieved snippets.\n</think>\n<answer>\n# Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) Based on Vector Quantization (VQ)\n\n## What VQ-based RDH Is\nReversible data hiding in VQ-compressed images embeds secret data into the index table produced by vector quantization while preserving the ability to recover the original cover image after extraction. Vector quantization compresses an image by partitioning it into blocks and mapping each block to a codebook entry via the minimum Euclidean distance, yielding an index table instead of a pixel grid; during decoding, the indices reconstruct the VQ image by selecting code words from the codebook. RDH methods operate on this representation to insert bits in ways that do not preclude exact reconstruction, typically by exploiting structure in the codebook and neighboring blocks. <cite id=\"a634cb95-1\">Vector quantization encodes images into index tables by assigning each block to the closest codebook vector, and RDH schemes embed data into this representation so that the original cover can be recovered after extraction.</cite>\n\n## Core Mechanisms\n\n### Codebooks, Side-Match, and Histogram Shifting\nVQ-based RDH methods often leverage the distributional properties of codebooks and use “side information” from neighboring blocks or side-matched vector quantization (SMVQ) to shift histograms toward zero. By repositioning the histogram toward zero using SMVQ prediction, fewer bits are needed to encode small indices, and indicator bits can be eliminated, creating extra space for secret data while supporting lossless VQ image reconstruction. <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">Side-matched vector quantization (SMVQ) prediction relocates the VQ histogram near zero, enabling fewer bits to encode small indices without indicator bits and yielding additional hiding space while maintaining lossless VQ reconstruction.</cite> Some methods exploit spatial relationships among side-match neighboring (SMN) blocks to achieve reversibility and improve compression or capacity. <cite id=\"a634cb95-0\">A reversible RDH for VQ-compressed images can exploit relationships among side-match neighboring blocks to achieve higher compression and larger capacity than existing reversible methods.</cite>\n\n### Generalizing Difference Expansion to Vectors\nA classical RDH family is difference expansion (DE). Tian’s original DE operates on pixel pairs, while Alattar generalized DE to vectors: instead of embedding one bit per pixel pair, multiple bits can be embedded by expanding the differences of a vector, increasing payload. This vectorized approach is naturally aligned with VQ since both operate on small blocks mapped to codebook entries. <cite id=\"698147c2-0\">Difference expansion (DE) was introduced by Tian using pixel pairs, and Alattar generalized DE by embedding n−1 bits into a vector of n pixels to improve performance.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-1\">Alattar’s extension replaces pixel pairs with vectors, enabling embedding of n−1 bits per vector and improving capacity relative to scalar-pair methods.</cite>\n\n### Index-Group Modification in Encrypted VQ\nSome VQ-based RDH schemes operate directly on the index table by grouping a high-occurrence index with one or more low-occurrence indices and modifying the high-occurrence index within the same group according to the secret bits. Optimization over the coefficient vector and index groups yields high hiding capacity, and separable operations can be designed when VQ data are encrypted (e.g., stream-cipher and permutation), allowing extraction, decryption, and image recovery in sequence. <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">By grouping a high-occurrence index with low-occurrence indices, the high-occurrence index can be modified within its group to embed bits; optimizing the coefficient vector per group achieves high capacity, and separable extraction, decryption, and recovery are supported under encryption.</cite>\n\n## Representative Schemes and Results\n\n- SMN/SMVQ-based RDH: Methods that use side-match neighboring blocks or side-matched vector quantization can achieve higher compression rates and larger embedding capacity compared to prior reversible methods, by exploiting correlations among neighboring blocks and re-locating histograms toward zero. <cite id=\"a634cb95-0\">Exploiting side-match neighboring blocks in VQ-compressed images yields a reversible RDH with higher compression and larger capacity than existing reversible methods.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">An SMVQ-based RDH achieves lossless VQ reconstruction by removing indicator bits through histogram relocation, improving embedding rate and capacity over prior VQ- and SMVQ-based schemes.</cite>\n\n- Encrypted VQ RDH: When VQ-encoded images are encrypted, RDH can still be performed by modifying indices within pre-defined groups, with optimized parameters maximizing capacity while maintaining image quality and ensuring reversibility and separability of operations. <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">In encrypted VQ-encoded images, grouping indices and modifying high-occurrence indices within groups enables high capacity embedding with reversibility and separable extraction and recovery.</cite>\n\n- Relation to DE/HS/PEE: VQ-based RDH complements classical families such as DE, histogram shifting (HS), and prediction-error expansion (PEE). DE generally offers low-distortion embedding at relatively high capacity; HS manipulates pixel histograms to create embedding room; PEE expands prediction errors in smooth regions. Vectorized DE and VQ codebook/index operations can increase capacity and improve compressibility in smooth or highly quantized regions. <cite id=\"a634cb95-1\">RDH families include difference expansion (DE), histogram shifting (HS), and prediction-error expansion (PEE).</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-0\">DE-based algorithms, including Alattar’s vector DE, provide relatively high capacity with low distortion by embedding into vector differences.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-4\">PEE-based methods expand prediction errors to increase capacity beyond DE, and combined strategies select smooth areas for embedding while leaving rough areas unchanged.</cite>\n\n## Trade-offs and Limitations\n\n- Scope of reversibility: Some SMVQ-based RDH methods recover the side-match VQ image rather than the original VQ image, which may limit generality unless the original codebook was SMVQ. Fully reversible VQ RDH that reconstructs the original VQ image can incur higher computational cost and may be less suitable for real-time applications. <cite id=\"a634cb95-2\">A reversible embedding scheme for SMVQ compressed images recovers only the SMVQ image, whereas a completely reversible scheme for general VQ compressed images exists but has high computational cost and is not suitable for real-time applications.</cite>\n\n- Quality and capacity trade-off: As with RDH in general, embedding more bits typically reduces fidelity, lowering PSNR, reflecting the inherent capacity–distortion trade-off. <cite id=\"3f0eb5c2-3\">Higher embedding (more bits) generally reduces image fidelity and PSNR, confirming the capacity–fidelity trade-off in data hiding.</cite>\n\n- Contextual comparisons: Transform-domain RDH (e.g., integer wavelet) and prediction-based methods can also achieve high capacity with high PSNR in smooth regions, providing competitive or alternative baselines depending on domain characteristics. <cite id=\"c3b22351-2\">Transform-domain RDH (e.g., integer wavelet) and prediction-based schemes can achieve high capacity with high PSNR in smooth regions, offering strong alternatives to spatial-domain methods.</cite>\n\n## When to Use VQ-Based RDH\nVQ-based RDH is attractive when the image is already compressed via VQ or when the system controls the codebook and quantization, because embedding operates on indices/codebook structure and can leverage SMVQ histogram relocation and vectorized difference expansion to increase capacity and compression. It is also natural in encrypted VQ pipelines, where index-group modification supports separable security and reversibility. <cite id=\"a634cb95-1\">VQ compression produces index tables that RDH can embed into while preserving reversibility.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">SMVQ-based methods use histogram relocation to reduce encoding overhead and add hiding space without sacrificing reversibility.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">Encrypted VQ settings benefit from index-group-based embedding with optimized capacity and separable extraction/recovery.</cite>\n\n## Summary\nVQ-based reversible data hiding embeds data into the quantization indices or codebook-structured residuals of VQ-compressed images, often using side-match/SMVQ to shift histograms toward zero, vectorized difference expansion to increase payload, and index-group modification to achieve high capacity with reversibility. These approaches can outperform prior reversible methods in compression and capacity, but fully reversible general-VQ methods may be computationally heavy, and capacity typically reduces image fidelity (lower PSNR). <cite id=\"a634cb95-0\">Exploiting side-match neighborhoods improves compression and capacity in reversible VQ-based RDH.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-3\">SMVQ-based RDH achieves lossless VQ reconstruction by removing indicator bits through histogram relocation and yields higher embedding capacity.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-4\">Index-group modification in encrypted VQ enables high capacity with separable extraction and reversibility.</cite> <cite id=\"a634cb95-2\">Fully reversible general-VQ methods can be computationally costly, and many SMVQ schemes recover the side-match VQ image rather than the original.</cite> <cite id=\"3f0eb5c2-3\">Embedding more bits generally lowers PSNR, reflecting the capacity–fidelity trade-off.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-0\">Vectorized difference expansion (as in Alattar’s generalization of Tian’s method) increases payload at relatively low distortion.</cite> <cite id=\"698147c2-4\">Transform/prediction-based RDH families also offer strong alternatives with high capacity and PSNR in smooth regions.</cite>\n</answer>",

It is important to multimedia security and has been widely studied. Reversible data hiding methods are becoming prevalent in the area because they can reconstruct the original cover image while extracting the embedded data. In this paper, we propose a new reversible method for vector quantization (VQ) compressed images. Our method takes advantages of the relationship among the side match neighbouring (SMN) blocks to achieve reversibility. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher compression rate and larger capacity than other existing reversible methods.\n\nTitle: Separable Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted VQ-Encoded Images\nSnippet: With the rapid development of digital communication and signal processing, a large amount of multimedia data, such as image, video, and audio, are transmitted on networks. However, secure management for multimedia data with privacy protection is an inevitable issue and also is one meaningful research topic. Reversible data-hiding (RDH) is an emerging technique which has greatly attracted researchers' interests in recent years [1][2][3][4]. As for the RDH technique, data hider can embed additional data into cover image reversibly, which means the original cover image can be completely recovered after extracting the embedded data. Some representative RDH schemes, such as difference expansion (DE) [1], histogram shifting (HS) [2], and prediction-error expansion (PEE) [3], have been proposed in the past few years. In addition to the RDH schemes for gray scale images, there are a lot of RDH schemes developed for color images [5], compressed images [6], and halftone images [7]. \n\nVector quantization (VQ) is an effective image encoding method, which can be utilized for image compression [8]. During the process of VQ encoding, the original uncompressed image I o is first divided into a series of nonoverlapping blocks. For each image block, Euclidean distances between the block with the L code words in the trained codebook C are calculated, and the index of the code word with the minimum Euclidean distance is recorded into the index table T as the encoded result for the current block. During VQ decoding, according to the indices in the index table T, all image blocks can be easily decoded as the corresponding code words in the codebook C to form the VQdecoded image I. Figure 1 illustrates an example of VQencoded image, in which a gray scale image with the size of M × N is compressed to an index table sized M/n × N/n, where n × n is the size of divided blocks. Each value in the index table, corresponding to one n × n block, can be represented with log 2 L bits.\n\nTitle: Lossless image data embedding in plain areas\nSnippet: Alattar [7] proposed a generalized version of Tian's scheme to enhance the payload, in which instead of pixel pairs the difference expansion of vectors is used. Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al.

This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.\n\nTitle: Reversible data hiding scheme with high embedding capacity using semi-indicator-free strategy\nSnippet: This work presents a novel reversible data-hiding scheme which embeds secret data into a side matched Vector Quantization (SMVQ)-compressed image, and achieves lossless reconstruction of a Vector Quantization (VQ)-compressed image. The rather random distributed histogram of a VQ-compressed image can be re-located to locations close to zero by SMVQ prediction. Thus, fewer bits can be used to encode SMVQ indices with very small values, and no indicator is required to encode these indices, which yields extra hiding space to hide secret data. Consequently, high embedding capacity and low bit rate scenarios can be deposited. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reversibility of the proposed scheme. Moreover, in terms of the embedding rate, the bit rate, and the embedding capacity, experimental results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than those of the former data hiding schemes for VQ-based and VQ/SMVQ-based compressed images.\n\nTitle: Separable Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted VQ-Encoded Images\nSnippet: In this paper, a reversible data-hiding scheme in encrypted, vector quantization (VQ) encoded images is proposed. During image encryption, VQ-encoded image, including codebook and index table, is encrypted by content owner with stream-cipher and permutation to protect the privacy of image contents. As for additional-data embedding, a baseline method is first proposed and its corresponding optimized method is then given. By grouping one high-occurrence index with one or multiple low-occurrence indices, a series of index groups are constructed. Thus, by modifying the high-occurrence index to the corresponding index within the same group according to the current to-be-embedded bits, data embedding can be realized. The optimal hiding capacity is obtained by optimizing the coefficient vector for different types of index groups. Separable operations of data extraction, image decryption, and recovery can be achieved on the receiver side based on the availability of the encryption and data-hiding keys. Experimental results show that our scheme can achieve high hiding capacity and satisfactory directly decrypted image quality and guarantee security and reversibility simultaneously.",

Reversible data hiding methods are becoming prevalent in the area because they can reconstruct the original cover image while extracting the embedded data. In this paper, we propose a new reversible method for vector quantization (VQ) compressed images. Our method takes advantages of the relationship among the side match neighbouring (SMN) blocks to achieve reversibility. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher compression rate and larger capacity than other existing reversible methods.",

                "text": "With the rapid development of digital communication and signal processing, a large amount of multimedia data, such as image, video, and audio, are transmitted on networks. However, secure management for multimedia data with privacy protection is an inevitable issue and also is one meaningful research topic. Reversible data-hiding (RDH) is an emerging technique which has greatly attracted researchers' interests in recent years [1][2][3][4]. As for the RDH technique, data hider can embed additional data into cover image reversibly, which means the original cover image can be completely recovered after extracting the embedded data. Some representative RDH schemes, such as difference expansion (DE) [1], histogram shifting (HS) [2], and prediction-error expansion (PEE) [3], have been proposed in the past few years. In addition to the RDH schemes for gray scale images, there are a lot of RDH schemes developed for color images [5], compressed images [6], and halftone images [7]. \n\nVector quantization (VQ) is an effective image encoding method, which can be utilized for image compression [8]. During the process of VQ encoding, the original uncompressed image I o is first divided into a series of nonoverlapping blocks. For each image block, Euclidean distances between the block with the L code words in the trained codebook C are calculated, and the index of the code word with the minimum Euclidean distance is recorded into the index table T as the encoded result for the current block. During VQ decoding, according to the indices in the index table T, all image blocks can be easily decoded as the corresponding code words in the codebook C to form the VQdecoded image I. Figure 1 illustrates an example of VQencoded image, in which a gray scale image with the size of M × N is compressed to an index table sized M/n × N/n, where n × n is the size of divided blocks. Each value in the index table, corresponding to one n × n block, can be represented with log 2 L bits.",

                "text": "Alattar [7] proposed a generalized version of Tian's scheme to enhance the payload, in which instead of pixel pairs the difference expansion of vectors is used. Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.",

Thus, fewer bits can be used to encode SMVQ indices with very small values, and no indicator is required to encode these indices, which yields extra hiding space to hide secret data. Consequently, high embedding capacity and low bit rate scenarios can be deposited. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reversibility of the proposed scheme. Moreover, in terms of the embedding rate, the bit rate, and the embedding capacity, experimental results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than those of the former data hiding schemes for VQ-based and VQ/SMVQ-based compressed images.\n\nTitle: Separable Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted VQ-Encoded Images\nSnippet: In this paper, a reversible data-hiding scheme in encrypted, vector quantization (VQ) encoded images is proposed. During image encryption, VQ-encoded image, including codebook and index table, is encrypted by content owner with stream-cipher and permutation to protect the privacy of image contents. As for additional-data embedding, a baseline method is first proposed and its corresponding optimized method is then given. By grouping one high-occurrence index with one or multiple low-occurrence indices, a series of index groups are constructed. Thus, by modifying the high-occurrence index to the corresponding index within the same group according to the current to-be-embedded bits, data embedding can be realized. The optimal hiding capacity is obtained by optimizing the coefficient vector for different types of index groups. Separable operations of data extraction, image decryption, and recovery can be achieved on the receiver side based on the availability of the encryption and data-hiding keys. Experimental results show that our scheme can achieve high hiding capacity and satisfactory directly decrypted image quality and guarantee security and reversibility simultaneously.",

Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.",

                "text": "With the rapid development of digital communication and signal processing, a large amount of multimedia data, such as image, video, and audio, are transmitted on networks. However, secure management for multimedia data with privacy protection is an inevitable issue and also is one meaningful research topic. Reversible data-hiding (RDH) is an emerging technique which has greatly attracted researchers' interests in recent years [1][2][3][4]. As for the RDH technique, data hider can embed additional data into cover image reversibly, which means the original cover image can be completely recovered after extracting the embedded data. Some representative RDH schemes, such as difference expansion (DE) [1], histogram shifting (HS) [2], and prediction-error expansion (PEE) [3], have been proposed in the past few years. In addition to the RDH schemes for gray scale images, there are a lot of RDH schemes developed for color images [5], compressed images [6], and halftone images [7]. \n\nVector quantization (VQ) is an effective image encoding method, which can be utilized for image compression [8]. During the process of VQ encoding, the original uncompressed image I o is first divided into a series of nonoverlapping blocks. For each image block, Euclidean distances between the block with the L code words in the trained codebook C are calculated, and the index of the code word with the minimum Euclidean distance is recorded into the index table T as the encoded result for the current block. During VQ decoding, according to the indices in the index table T, all image blocks can be easily decoded as the corresponding code words in the codebook C to form the VQdecoded image I. Figure 1 illustrates an example of VQencoded image, in which a gray scale image with the size of M × N is compressed to an index table sized M/n × N/n, where n × n is the size of divided blocks. Each value in the index table, corresponding to one n × n block, can be represented with log 2 L bits.",

Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.",

However, secure management for multimedia data with privacy protection is an inevitable issue and also is one meaningful research topic. Reversible data-hiding (RDH) is an emerging technique which has greatly attracted researchers' interests in recent years [1][2][3][4]. As for the RDH technique, data hider can embed additional data into cover image reversibly, which means the original cover image can be completely recovered after extracting the embedded data. Some representative RDH schemes, such as difference expansion (DE) [1], histogram shifting (HS) [2], and prediction-error expansion (PEE) [3], have been proposed in the past few years. In addition to the RDH schemes for gray scale images, there are a lot of RDH schemes developed for color images [5], compressed images [6], and halftone images [7]. \n\nVector quantization (VQ) is an effective image encoding method, which can be utilized for image compression [8]. During the process of VQ encoding, the original uncompressed image I o is first divided into a series of nonoverlapping blocks. For each image block, Euclidean distances between the block with the L code words in the trained codebook C are calculated, and the index of the code word with the minimum Euclidean distance is recorded into the index table T as the encoded result for the current block. During VQ decoding, according to the indices in the index table T, all image blocks can be easily decoded as the corresponding code words in the codebook C to form the VQdecoded image I. Figure 1 illustrates an example of VQencoded image, in which a gray scale image with the size of M × N is compressed to an index table sized M/n × N/n, where n × n is the size of divided blocks. Each value in the index table, corresponding to one n × n block, can be represented with log 2 L bits.",

Reversible data hiding methods are becoming prevalent in the area because they can reconstruct the original cover image while extracting the embedded data. In this paper, we propose a new reversible method for vector quantization (VQ) compressed images. Our method takes advantages of the relationship among the side match neighbouring (SMN) blocks to achieve reversibility. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher compression rate and larger capacity than other existing reversible methods.\n\nTitle: Reversible data hiding scheme with high embedding capacity using semi-indicator-free strategy\nSnippet: This work presents a novel reversible data-hiding scheme which embeds secret data into a side matched Vector Quantization (SMVQ)-compressed image, and achieves lossless reconstruction of a Vector Quantization (VQ)-compressed image. The rather random distributed histogram of a VQ-compressed image can be re-located to locations close to zero by SMVQ prediction. Thus, fewer bits can be used to encode SMVQ indices with very small values, and no indicator is required to encode these indices, which yields extra hiding space to hide secret data. Consequently, high embedding capacity and low bit rate scenarios can be deposited. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reversibility of the proposed scheme. Moreover, in terms of the embedding rate, the bit rate, and the embedding capacity, experimental results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than those of the former data hiding schemes for VQ-based and VQ/SMVQ-based compressed images.\n\nTitle: Advances in medical image watermarking: a state of the art review\nSnippet: Wu et al.

In the communication system, PSNR is an engineering term that represents the ratio of the maximum possible power of a signal to the destructive noise power that affects its representation accuracy. When applied to images, PSNR is one of the indicators used to measure image quality. It is based on the definition of MSE (Mean Square Error), which can be defined as: \n\nWe use PSNR to evaluate the host image's distortion due to data hiding. Therefore, the I(i, j) and K(i, j) in the formula are the original host image and the resulting image after data hiding, respectively. We conducted the experiments and recorded the results in Table 4. From Table 4, we find the PSNR values are different, though the size of the images is the same. The PSNR of Image No. 1 is the lowest, and that of Image No. 4 is the highest. This is the number of bits we hide in Image No. 1 is the least, while the most in Image No. 4. For images with the same size, the more information bits embedded, the lower the fidelity of the image and the smaller the PSNR. This further confirms that the capacity of information hiding conflicts with the fidelity of the carrier.\n\nTitle: High-Security Image Steganography Technique using XNOR Operation and Fibonacci Algorithm\nSnippet: The PSNR is an expression for the ratio between the maximum possible value of a signal and the distorting noise that affects its representation quality. If the PSNR values are greater than 50 dB when tested on several images, the images are high in quality [37]. This type of evaluation is used to measure the quality of the image after embedding. PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy presentation codecs (e.g., for image hiding). In this case, the signal is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by the embedding process. When comparing image representation codecs, PSNR approximates the human perception of reconstruction quality. Although a higher PSNR generally indicates that the reconstruction is of higher quality, in some cases, it may not [38]. PSNR is most easily defined via the mean squared error (MSE), as mentioned before, which is based on the dimensions of the image. \n\nThe MSE is calculated by obtaining the average square error. Then its result will be used to calculate PSNR to evaluate the resolution and quality of the stego-image, as shown in Table VII. \n\nTable VIII shows the comparison stages of the results with four other methods in [30], [32], [26], and [33], with 8Kb, 10Kb, 13Kb, and 16Kb of secret messages, and 512*512 size of cover images. We note that the bigger the secret messages' size, the lower the PSNR value as more significant data will cause more distortion to the stego-image. From the results, high values of PSNR are obtained compared with previous findings. This indicates that the proposed method is very efficient in hiding data, which means that this technique can keep changes to the stego-image to a minimum. Therefore, we can conclude that this technique has a good quality of imperceptibility. From the figures of Lena's and Baboon's stego-images, the histogram of the stego-images was similar to that of the cover images, resulting from alternately choosing either green or blue channels to embed the secret data, which does not give any significant difference between the two images.",

The rather random distributed histogram of a VQ-compressed image can be re-located to locations close to zero by SMVQ prediction. Thus, fewer bits can be used to encode SMVQ indices with very small values, and no indicator is required to encode these indices, which yields extra hiding space to hide secret data. Consequently, high embedding capacity and low bit rate scenarios can be deposited. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reversibility of the proposed scheme. Moreover, in terms of the embedding rate, the bit rate, and the embedding capacity, experimental results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than those of the former data hiding schemes for VQ-based and VQ/SMVQ-based compressed images.",

        "output": "Title: Efficient Reversible Data Hiding Algorithms Based on Dual Prediction\nSnippet: Data hiding is an important technology in the areas of information security and multimedia copyright protections as it allows the concealment of data within the digital media for copyright protection and data protection. Many schemes of data hiding have been proposed to address the issues and challenges related to hiding the data, such as embedding capacity, imperceptibility and reversibility. \n\nIn this technique, the data is supposed to be seamlessly hidden or embedded into a carrier or cover signal (audio, images, video) in way that makes it hard for unauthorized people to access it [1]. In the digital imaging domain, several data hiding techniques have been proposed [2][3][4]. Despite the efficiency of these techniques in protecting the data, most of them are not capable of restoring the original cover image upon the extraction of embedded data. This poses a challenge to applications that require the preservation of the cover image after the hidden data is extracted. Accordingly, a great interest has grown in the past few years in the development of reversible data hiding (RDH) techniques that are capable of restoring the original image. \n\nSeveral RDH techniques have been proposed in the literature and they compete in different aspects which include the embedding capacity, the quality of the stego image, size of overhead information and computational complexity [2]. Generally, they can be grouped into three different classes based on the concept of operation: difference expansion, histogram shifting, and prediction-based techniques. Difference expansion (DE) algorithms are one popular class of reversible data hiding that are characterized with low distortion and relatively high embedding c b a x Figure 1 Context for predicting pixel x capacity. The first difference expansion technique was proposed by Tian in [5]. In this technique, the cover image is partitioned into a series of non-overlapping pixel pairs. A secret bit is then embedded using the difference expansion of each pixel pair. Several DE-based algorithms were developed based on Tian's technique [6][7][8][9]. Alattar [6] used DE with vectors instead of pixel pairs to extend and improve the performance of Tian's algorithm. Hu, et al. proposed a DE-based technique that improved the compressibility of the location map [8].\n\nTitle: High-Capacity Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images by Information Preprocessing\nSnippet: In the last few years, with the development of technologies for digital image processing, the transmission and exchange of images have become more and more convenient. At the same time, original images have begun to suffer from many security issues. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in cover images is a methodology that embeds secret messages into original images, such as law forensics, military, and medical images, in a reversible way such that the cover images can be completely recovered after the hiding data are extracted. \n\nReversible data hiding can be categorized into four major methods: lossless compression, difference expansion (DE), prediction error expansion (PEE), and histogram shifting (HS). \n\ne core idea of lossless compression [1][2][3] is that secret information is embedded into compressed images. Commonly, however, we cannot achieve high-capacity data hiding. Tian [4] proposed a difference expansion information hiding method that explored the vacant room in digital images. Compared to the traditional method, the data hiding capacity is significantly improved. e paper calculated all the differences between two adjacent pixels and embedded secret data into the values. DE was generalized by Alatter [5], in which n-1 bits can be embedded into a vector with n pixels. odi and Rodriguez [6] proposed an excellent extension of DE called prediction error expansion. PEE uses each pixel's prediction error instead of the pixel difference to hide information, to increase the hiding capacity beyond that of DE. A high-fidelity reversible data hiding method was proposed by Li et al. [7], in which a new prediction method called pixel value ordering (PVO) was combined with PEE. For each pixel block, the pixels are reordered into a pixel vector according to their values, and the secret data are embedded into two prediction errors, which correspond to the difference between the smallest pixel and the second smallest pixel and between the largest pixel and the second largest pixel. In [8], all k maximum pixels (or minimum pixels) were treated as a unit for information hiding. e previous method was based on performing PVO and PVO-k in a block-by-block manner, and generally, the capacity was small.\n\nTitle: Lossless image data embedding in plain areas\nSnippet: Alattar [7] proposed a generalized version of Tian's scheme to enhance the payload, in which instead of pixel pairs the difference expansion of vectors is used. Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.\n\nTitle: An Improved Integer Transform Combining with an Irregular Block Partition\nSnippet: After conducting deep research on all existing reversible data hiding (RDH) methods based on Alattar’s integer transform, we discover that the frequently-used method in obtaining the difference value list of an image block may lead to high embedding distortion. To this end, we propose an improved Alattar’s transform-based-RDH-method. Firstly, the irregular block partition method which makes full use of high correlation between two neighboring pixels is proposed to increase the embedding performance. Specifically, each image block is composed of a center pixel and several pixels surrounding this center pixel. Thus, the difference value list is created by using the center pixel to predict each pixel surrounding it. Since the center pixel is highly related to each pixel surrounding it, a sharp difference value histogram is generated. Secondly, the mean value of an image block in Alattar’s integer transform has embedding invariance property, and therefore, it can be used for increasing the estimation performance of a block’s local complexity. Finally, two-layer embedding is combined into our scheme in order to optimize the embedding performance. Experimental results show that our method is effective.\n\nTitle: A Block-Based Division Reversible Data Hiding Method in Encrypted Images\nSnippet: Data hiding is a technique in which secret messages are embedded into digital media by making non-perceptible slight changes to the cover media. Data hiding can be categorized as irreversible or reversible. The difference between reversible and irreversible data hiding approaches is that, in the former, secret messages can be extracted from the stego-media and the original cover media can be recovered without distortion. On the other hand, in the irreversible data hiding approach, the original cover media cannot be recovered without loss of information. \n\nReversible data hiding can be used in many applications, therefore, this approach has been extensively studied. In 2003, Tian [1] proposed the difference expansion (DE) method, which is based on the difference expansion transform of pairs of pixels. In 2004, Alattar [2] extended Tian's method using a difference expansion of vectors, instead of pairs, to increase the payload. Thodi and Rodriquez [3] proposed a new difference expansion scheme, termed the prediction error expansion. In 2006, Ni et al. [4] proposed a reversible data hiding method based on the histogram shifting. The method utilizes the peak point to embed secret messages and shift the pixels between the peak point and zero or the minimum points of the histogram of an image. In 2011, D. Coltuc [5] reduced the embedding distortion of the prediction error expansion reversible watermarking. Gao et al. [6] developed a novel framework for lossless data embedding (LDE) by combining the advantages of the generalized statistical quantity histogram (GSQH) and histogram-based embedding. Li et al. [7] proposed a prediction-error expansion (PEE) for selecting pixels from smooth areas for data embedding, while leaving pixels from rough areas unchanged. In 2012, Wu et al. [8] developed an embedding method and investigated the predictive ability of the new prediction scheme. In 2009, Hong et al. [9] established a histogram of the difference between original pixels and the corresponding predicted values, and used two bins (0 and −1) to achieve a high payload.",

                "text": "Data hiding is an important technology in the areas of information security and multimedia copyright protections as it allows the concealment of data within the digital media for copyright protection and data protection. Many schemes of data hiding have been proposed to address the issues and challenges related to hiding the data, such as embedding capacity, imperceptibility and reversibility. \n\nIn this technique, the data is supposed to be seamlessly hidden or embedded into a carrier or cover signal (audio, images, video) in way that makes it hard for unauthorized people to access it [1]. In the digital imaging domain, several data hiding techniques have been proposed [2][3][4]. Despite the efficiency of these techniques in protecting the data, most of them are not capable of restoring the original cover image upon the extraction of embedded data. This poses a challenge to applications that require the preservation of the cover image after the hidden data is extracted. Accordingly, a great interest has grown in the past few years in the development of reversible data hiding (RDH) techniques that are capable of restoring the original image. \n\nSeveral RDH techniques have been proposed in the literature and they compete in different aspects which include the embedding capacity, the quality of the stego image, size of overhead information and computational complexity [2]. Generally, they can be grouped into three different classes based on the concept of operation: difference expansion, histogram shifting, and prediction-based techniques. Difference expansion (DE) algorithms are one popular class of reversible data hiding that are characterized with low distortion and relatively high embedding c b a x Figure 1 Context for predicting pixel x capacity. The first difference expansion technique was proposed by Tian in [5]. In this technique, the cover image is partitioned into a series of non-overlapping pixel pairs. A secret bit is then embedded using the difference expansion of each pixel pair. Several DE-based algorithms were developed based on Tian's technique [6][7][8][9]. Alattar [6] used DE with vectors instead of pixel pairs to extend and improve the performance of Tian's algorithm. Hu, et al. proposed a DE-based technique that improved the compressibility of the location map [8].",

At the same time, original images have begun to suffer from many security issues. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in cover images is a methodology that embeds secret messages into original images, such as law forensics, military, and medical images, in a reversible way such that the cover images can be completely recovered after the hiding data are extracted. \n\nReversible data hiding can be categorized into four major methods: lossless compression, difference expansion (DE), prediction error expansion (PEE), and histogram shifting (HS). \n\ne core idea of lossless compression [1][2][3] is that secret information is embedded into compressed images. Commonly, however, we cannot achieve high-capacity data hiding. Tian [4] proposed a difference expansion information hiding method that explored the vacant room in digital images. Compared to the traditional method, the data hiding capacity is significantly improved. e paper calculated all the differences between two adjacent pixels and embedded secret data into the values. DE was generalized by Alatter [5], in which n-1 bits can be embedded into a vector with n pixels. odi and Rodriguez [6] proposed an excellent extension of DE called prediction error expansion. PEE uses each pixel's prediction error instead of the pixel difference to hide information, to increase the hiding capacity beyond that of DE. A high-fidelity reversible data hiding method was proposed by Li et al. [7], in which a new prediction method called pixel value ordering (PVO) was combined with PEE. For each pixel block, the pixels are reordered into a pixel vector according to their values, and the secret data are embedded into two prediction errors, which correspond to the difference between the smallest pixel and the second smallest pixel and between the largest pixel and the second largest pixel. In [8], all k maximum pixels (or minimum pixels) were treated as a unit for information hiding. e previous method was based on performing PVO and PVO-k in a block-by-block manner, and generally, the capacity was small.",

                "text": "Alattar [7] proposed a generalized version of Tian's scheme to enhance the payload, in which instead of pixel pairs the difference expansion of vectors is used. Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.",

            "snippet": "Data hiding is an important technology in the areas of information security and multimedia copyright protections as it allows the concealment of data within the digital media for copyright protection and data protection. Many schemes of data hiding have been proposed to address the issues and challenges related to hiding the data, such as embedding capacity, imperceptibility and reversibility. \n\nIn this technique, the data is supposed to be seamlessly hidden or embedded into a carrier or cover signal (audio, images, video) in way that makes it hard for unauthorized people to access it [1]. In the digital imaging domain, several data hiding techniques have been proposed [2][3][4]. Despite the efficiency of these techniques in protecting the data, most of them are not capable of restoring the original cover image upon the extraction of embedded data. This poses a challenge to applications that require the preservation of the cover image after the hidden data is extracted. Accordingly, a great interest has grown in the past few years in the development of reversible data hiding (RDH) techniques that are capable of restoring the original image. \n\nSeveral RDH techniques have been proposed in the literature and they compete in different aspects which include the embedding capacity, the quality of the stego image, size of overhead information and computational complexity [2]. Generally, they can be grouped into three different classes based on the concept of operation: difference expansion, histogram shifting, and prediction-based techniques. Difference expansion (DE) algorithms are one popular class of reversible data hiding that are characterized with low distortion and relatively high embedding c b a x Figure 1 Context for predicting pixel x capacity. The first difference expansion technique was proposed by Tian in [5]. In this technique, the cover image is partitioned into a series of non-overlapping pixel pairs. A secret bit is then embedded using the difference expansion of each pixel pair. Several DE-based algorithms were developed based on Tian's technique [6][7][8][9]. Alattar [6] used DE with vectors instead of pixel pairs to extend and improve the performance of Tian's algorithm. Hu, et al. proposed a DE-based technique that improved the compressibility of the location map [8].",

            "snippet": "In the last few years, with the development of technologies for digital image processing, the transmission and exchange of images have become more and more convenient. At the same time, original images have begun to suffer from many security issues. Reversible data hiding (RDH) in cover images is a methodology that embeds secret messages into original images, such as law forensics, military, and medical images, in a reversible way such that the cover images can be completely recovered after the hiding data are extracted. \n\nReversible data hiding can be categorized into four major methods: lossless compression, difference expansion (DE), prediction error expansion (PEE), and histogram shifting (HS). \n\ne core idea of lossless compression [1][2][3] is that secret information is embedded into compressed images. Commonly, however, we cannot achieve high-capacity data hiding. Tian [4] proposed a difference expansion information hiding method that explored the vacant room in digital images. Compared to the traditional method, the data hiding capacity is significantly improved. e paper calculated all the differences between two adjacent pixels and embedded secret data into the values. DE was generalized by Alatter [5], in which n-1 bits can be embedded into a vector with n pixels. odi and Rodriguez [6] proposed an excellent extension of DE called prediction error expansion. PEE uses each pixel's prediction error instead of the pixel difference to hide information, to increase the hiding capacity beyond that of DE. A high-fidelity reversible data hiding method was proposed by Li et al. [7], in which a new prediction method called pixel value ordering (PVO) was combined with PEE. For each pixel block, the pixels are reordered into a pixel vector according to their values, and the secret data are embedded into two prediction errors, which correspond to the difference between the smallest pixel and the second smallest pixel and between the largest pixel and the second largest pixel. In [8], all k maximum pixels (or minimum pixels) were treated as a unit for information hiding. e previous method was based on performing PVO and PVO-k in a block-by-block manner, and generally, the capacity was small.",

Also Kamstra et al. [8] have extended Tian's method by using the information in the low-pass band to find appropriate expandable differences in the highpass band. Recently Kim et al. [15] improved [6], [8] by introducing a new location map and a new embedding method. Chang et al. [9] presented a reversible embedding scheme for side-match vector quantization compressed images. Their method can recover only the side match vector quantization image instead of the vector quantization image. Chang and Lin [10] suggested a completely reversible embedding scheme for vector quantization compressed images. However, the computational cost for their method is high, and is not suitable for real-time applications. \n\nNi et al. [11] presented a lossless data embedding algorithm based on the spatial domain histogram shifting. In [12] a high capacity lossless technique was proposed by the author based on the relocation of zeros and peaks of the histogram of image blocks to embed the data. Recently, Lin and Hsueh [13] suggested a lossless scheme based on increasing the differences between two adjacent pixels. Among the studies performed on transform domain Xuan et al. [14] reported the remarkable reversible method carried out in the integer wavelet transform domain. \n\nIn accordance with to international lossless and near lossless image compression standards, the compression procedure is often composed of creating image prediction. This prediction step usually applies a predictor to estimate the pixel values of an input image. Recently few prediction based data hiding methods have been proposed [16,17,18]. Thodi et al. [17] expanded the difference between a pixel and its predicted value in the context of the pixel. Also in [18] a method based on gradient-adjusted prediction (GAP) is proposed by the authors of this paper. This scheme is capable of hiding more secret data with absolutely high PSNR. \n\nThe proposed method is based on increasing the differences between pixels of cover image and their prediction values. Increasing the prediction error and modifying the pixels force distortion to the image.",

[9] established a histogram of the difference between original pixels and the corresponding predicted values, and used two bins (0 and −1) to achieve a high payload.",
