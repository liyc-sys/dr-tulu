Initial Google search indicates Timothy Rowe, with a direct PDF snippet showing the abstract definition and a Wikipedia confirmation. A follow-up search for the Proceedings of the Royal Society B did not yield the paper (suggesting the correct venue might be the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology). Browsing the PDF was blocked, but multiple independent sources (T&F page, UT Austin PDF mirror, Google Scholar, Wikipedia, and secondary papers citing \"following Rowe, 1988\") consistently attribute the definition to Timothy (John) Rowe in 1988. The author's full name is John A. Wible, but the collaborator and author of the definition is Timothy Rowe. Evidence is sufficient to answer succinctly.\n\nI will provide a short-form answer with the author's name.</think>\n<answer>\\boxed{Timothy Rowe}</answer>",

They provided a webpage that's just a 403 Forbidden error, which isn't helpful. So, the main task here is to clean the raw webpage text they provided.\n\nLooking at the scraped content, the title is \"403: Forbidden\" and the URL is from a university server. The full text is an error message with some technical details. The user wants me to remove unnecessary info and keep the main content. But in this case, the main content is just the error message. \n\nWait, the user might have expected the webpage to have the answer, but it's a forbidden error. So, the actual content isn't there. The user might be confused because they thought the webpage would have the answer, but it's not accessible. \n\nI need to clean the text by removing the error details. The original text has \"Error: Forbidden\" and some ID info. The cleaned version should just state the error. But the user's instruction is to remove unnecessary info and keep the main content. Since the main content here is the error message, I should present that. \n\nBut maybe the user made a mistake in scraping the wrong URL. However, the task is to process the given text. So, the answer is that the webpage is forbidden, and there's no content to extract. The user might need to check the URL again. \n\nBut the user's question is about the Nirbhaya case. The actual answer is that the male victim's name was Akshay Kumar, but the case is more famously known for the female victim, Nirbhaya. However, the user is specifically asking for the male victim's name. Wait, in the Nirbhaya case, there were multiple victims. The primary victim was a female, but there was also a male victim, a 20-year-old man named Akshay Kumar. However, I need to confirm this. \n\nBut the user's provided webpage doesn't have this information. The webpage is just an error. So, the answer to the user's question isn't in the provided text. However, the user's instruction is to clean the webpage text, not to answer the question. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to clean the given text, which is the 403 error. The cleaned text would be \"Error: Forbidden\" and the URL. But the user wants the main content. Since the main content is the error message, the cleaned text would be that. \n\nBut the user might have intended to provide a different webpage, but due to a mistake, it's a forbidden error. So, the answer to the original question is that the male victim's name was Akshay Kumar, but the provided webpage doesn't contain that information. However, the user's request is to clean the given text, not to answer the question. \n\nTherefore, the cleaned webpage text is just the error message. The user might need to be informed that the webpage is inaccessible, but according to the instructions, I should just clean the text as per their request.\n</think>\n\nCleaned webpage text:  \n**Error:** Forbidden  \n\n**403**: Forbidden ID: `pdx1::4jksk-1763091390744-523611708df7`",
