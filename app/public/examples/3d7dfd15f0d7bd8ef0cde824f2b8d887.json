  "final_response": "# Overview\n\nBelow are refined and optimized designs for four components of a badminton video analytics pipeline: object detection and tracking, technical action recognition, tactical intent recognition, and subsequent action prediction. Recommendations are grounded in recent badminton-specific work and complementary sports analytics evidence, with concrete model choices, feature sets, evaluation protocols, and ablations.\n\n# 1) Object Detection and Tracking within Badminton Videos\n\nChallenge and constraints:\n- Shuttlecocks are tiny, fast, and often occluded; court markings and rackets create clutter, and broadcast cameras have limited focal lengths, making detection/tracking extremely challenging in singles matches. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-3\">Shuttlecocks can exceed 400 km/h, and line judges rely on slow motion for “in/out,” motivating robust computer-vision tracking under occlusion and blur</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Shuttlecocks are small, frequently occluded, and tracking errors can misassociate hits without fusion to player detection</cite>.\n\nRecommended pipeline:\n- Detector: Start with a task-specific shuttlecock detector trained on professional/amateur broadcast frames; use a lightweight backbone with attention/feature pyramid to handle scale variation and blur. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-0\">A residual-enhanced U-Net variant adapted from TrackNetV2 improved detection accuracy and speed for fast-moving shuttlecocks under low quality and motion blur</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-2\">A public shuttlecock detection dataset contains 55,563 frames (professional and amateur) at 1280×720, downsampled to 512×288 for faster inference</cite>.\n- Tracker: Use a sports-tuned deep occlusion-aware tracker; avoid direct transfer from tennis-only TrackNet to badminton due to speed/structure differences. <cite id=\"89327513-0\">Direct transfer of TrackNet trained on tennis to badminton yielded precision 75.8% and recall 22.9% on the badminton test, inadequate due to fundamental differences in velocity, trajectory, and shape</cite>. <cite id=\"89327513-2\">Badminton speeds (e.g., 417 km/h smash) are substantially higher than tennis, degrading tracking quality and justifying badminton-specific training data and hyperparameters</cite>.\n- Multi-object tracking (MOT) strategy: Combine player and ball detections; stabilize ball tracks with racket and court priors; handle occlusions with visibility masks and trajectory smoothing. <cite id=\"89327513-1\">Badminton, table tennis, and volleyball exhibit structured scenes with similar/appearance, heavy occlusion, and rapid motion—conditions where long-term multi-object tracking must exploit structural properties</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Fusing shuttlecock tracking with player hit detection refines shot attribution and stabilizes tracking when the ball temporarily disappears</cite>.\n- Evaluation metrics and protocols: Use per-frame detection (mAP, IoU thresholds), tracking MOTA/MOTP, and event-level accuracy (e.g., hit timing/position). Incorporate both professional and community-level datasets to ensure robustness. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">A fusion approach integrating shuttlecock and player hits improved shot identification accuracy in practice</cite>. <cite id=\"89327513-4\">Broadcast sports datasets with fixed cameras and ideal conditions underrepresent community-level variability; evaluation should include such challenging settings</cite>.\n- Practical deployment: Leverage real-world systems for validation and error analysis. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-3\">A deployed badminton “in/out” system faced occlusions and latency constraints typical of optical tracking, requiring practical compromises and human-in-the-loop corrections in professional settings</cite>.\n\n# 2) Recognition of Technical Actions performed by Singles Players\n\nChallenge:\n- Badminton strokes are short, rapid, and sometimes grouped; many “hitting” actions appear similar unless analyzed with skeleton and modality-aware models. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Advanced skeleton-based action recognition struggles with short, rapid strokes; many actions fall under a general “hitting” class and are ambiguous across two players</cite>.\n\nRecommended design:\n- Modality choices: Combine RGB video with skeleton-based representations. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">HPE filters out background noise and focuses on motion nuances; SAR models can then distinguish subtle differences</cite>. \n- Model family: Use recent video/skeleton transformers with temporal context. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">State-of-the-art video-based action recognizers (SlowFast, TimeSformer, MViT-V2) and skeleton-based methods (ST-GCN, PoseC3D) provide strong baselines for badminton action recognition</cite>. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">A Badminton Stroke-type Transformer tailored for racket sports addresses the fine-grained stroke classification challenge</cite>.\n- Feature engineering: \n  - Video features: 3D CNN features (SlowFast, TimeSformer) with long-range temporal attention. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">SlowFast, TimeSformer, and MViT-V2 achieve SOTA in video-based action recognition and are included in a badminton benchmark</cite>.\n  - Skeleton features: PoseC3D/ST-GCN with joint/segment velocities and relative pose to racket. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">PoseC3D and ST-GCN are included as strong skeleton baselines in badminton evaluation</cite>. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Skeleton-based analysis emphasizes racket-related motion to separate stroke types</cite>.\n- Context and multi-view robustness: Fuse court layout and player positions from tracking to disambiguate same-stroke variations by side/trajectory. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Inter-player relationships and limited information make stroke attribution ambiguous; modeling context can help determine which player executed a stroke</cite>.\n- Evaluation: Use a fine-grained badminton action set (e.g., high/low clear, drop shot, smash, net-cuts) and report per-class F1, macro-F1, and confusion matrices; include occlusion and near-miss cases. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">A benchmark with diverse methods provides a holistic understanding of badminton action recognition strengths and weaknesses</cite>.\n\n# 3) Recognition of Tactical Intent behind Singles Players’ Actions\n\nDefinition and proxies:\n- Tactical intent can be proxied by rally-level outcomes and shot influence (e.g., whether a shot increases winning probability), position selection (net vs. baseline), and shot patterns (attacking vs. defensive). <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Predicting future shots from past rally context is central to strategic planning in turn-based sports like badminton</cite>. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Shot influence prediction uses rally sequences labeled with BLSR to classify winning vs. losing rallies, enabling analysis of tactical impact</cite>.\n\nRecommended approach:\n- Representation: Use BLSR-style rally sequences as input; encode shot type, area, direction, rally number, and score state. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">BLSR represents rally processes and has been used to predict shot influence with CNN/encoder-based models</cite>. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">A labeled dataset of 1,409 rallies (15,742 shots) was used to predict rally outcomes from a target player’s actions</cite>.\n- Model: Sequence-to-sequence with attention. \n  - Baselines: BiLSTM, Transformer encoder-decoder, and attention-based models; include interpretable prototypes for policy insights. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">BiLSTM, ProSeNet, DeepMoji-like sequence encoders, ON-LSTM, and standard Transformer were compared for rally outcome prediction</cite>.\n  - Rationale: Long short-term dependencies across rallies and attention over multi-shot sequences capture positional choices and score-driven adjustments. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Prior models captured tactical patterns from shot type and area, but richer context improves predictive power</cite>.\n- Features beyond shot/area: Add rally timing, tempo (interval between shots), net invasions, smash rates per zone, and second-hit success to reflect risk-seeking intent. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Limitations of using only shot type and area motivate multi-input modeling to capture broader tactical factors</cite>.\n- Evaluation: \n  - Outcome prediction (win/lose rally), shot influence, and positional intent (net vs. baseline) with AUC, F1, and confusion matrices; ablate feature groups to quantify the contribution of shot type vs. position vs. temporal context. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">The BLSR-based evaluation setup and split (80/10/10) provide a template for ablation and comparison</cite>.\n- Coaching analytics: Provide interpretable metrics (e.g., “net invasion on smash rallies increased winning probability by X%”) and drill-down to shot-level attribution. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Shot influence and optimal drop locations aid decision-making and strategy refinement</cite>.\n\n# 4) Prediction of Singles Players’ Subsequent Actions\n\nProblem framing:\n- Subsequent action prediction can be cast as intention-aware action prediction: predict the next shot type/position from the current and prior state, integrating tactical and technical signals.\n\nRecommended architecture and training:\n- Input: Multi-modal history (video clip + skeleton + shot/area/time features) and current rally context (score, player positions, trajectory). \n- Model: Transformer with cross-attention over video/skeleton and structured features; incorporate gated recurrent units for long-horizon dependencies. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Transformer and BiLSTM baselines are effective for shot sequence modeling; attention mechanisms capture long-range dependencies in rally sequences</cite>.\n- Training signals:\n  - One-step next-shot prediction (classification).\n  - Multi-step rollout (sequence-to-sequence), with curriculum starting from local transitions to longer horizons.\n  - Incorporate outcome supervision (win/lose conditional likelihood) to bias towards winning intents. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Using rally-level outcomes and shot influence provides supervisory signals for intention-aware prediction in badminton</cite>.\n- Contextual features and ablations:\n  - Ablate the contribution of: raw video-only, skeleton-only, shot/area features, temporal context length, and score/rally state. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Comparisons among BiLSTM, ProSeNet, ON-LSTM, and Transformer in a controlled rally prediction setup provide a template for ablation</cite>.\n- Decision-focused policies:\n  - Beam search or Monte Carlo Tree Search for multi-step plans that consider feasible shot transitions and court legality; use a value head approximating winning probability. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Sequence modeling for shot prediction supports strategic planning and analysis of shot influence in turn-based badminton</cite>.\n\n# End-to-End Pipeline Integration and Evaluation\n\nIntegration:\n- Detection and tracking drive both HPE and event timing; refine shots with fusion as in deployed systems. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Shot refinement via fusion of shuttlecock tracking and player hits improves shot attribution</cite>.\n- Use video/skeleton recognizers to label current actions;

accurate trajectories help future event detection</cite>.\n- Technical actions: per-class F1 and macro-F1 for a fine-grained stroke set; confusion analysis under occlusion/fast motion. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Short, rapid strokes and cross-player ambiguity challenge SAR/HAR models</cite>.\n- Tactical intent: rally outcome prediction AUC/F1 and shot-influence classification F1; ablate feature groups. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Rally-level datasets and ablations enable measuring tactical impact</cite>.\n- Subsequent action prediction: next-shot accuracy, multi-step rollout MLE/expected outcome, and interpretability of intent shifts. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Intention-aware prediction aligns with coaching and strategic planning needs in badminton</cite>.\n\n# Practical Tips and Ablations\n\n- Start narrow then expand: First stabilize detection/tracking and technical action recognition before adding complex intent models; many failures stem from noisy detections. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Stabilizing shot attribution with detection fusion is necessary to avoid mislabeling</cite>.\n- Use task-specific augmentations: motion blur, speed perturbations, small object crops, and occlusion masks to harden detection and recognition. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-0\">Residual learning within U-Net improved detection under motion blur and low quality</cite>.\n- Compare trackers beyond DeepSORT: sports-tuned deep occlusion-aware trackers and TrackNet variants with badminton-specific training outperform naive transfers. <cite id=\"89327513-0\">Tennis-trained TrackNet underperformed on badminton due to domain differences</cite>.\n- Feature fusion matters: Combine video features with skeleton and structured shot features; multi-input transformers often outperform single-modality baselines for intent. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Limitations of using only shot type/area motivate richer multi-input modeling</cite>.\n- Community-level robustness: Include low-budget camera footage with motion, occlusion, and variable viewpoints to avoid overfitting to ideal broadcast conditions. <cite id=\"89327513-4\">Broadcast datasets miss community-level variability; new benchmarks like TTA target such conditions</cite>.\n\n# Summary\n\n- Detection and tracking: Build a fast, robust shuttlecock detector and a badminton-specific deep tracker; fuse with player hits to stabilize shot attribution under occlusion. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-0\">Residual U-Net improvements address motion blur and low quality</cite>. <cite id=\"89327513-0\">Avoid direct tennis-to-badminton transfer;

By incorporating a diverse set of methodologies, ranging from video-based deep learning architectures to skeleton-based models, our study covers a wide spectrum of techniques prevalent in the field. Our results provide a holistic and detailed understanding of badminton action recognition. \n\nThe inclusion of various types of methods, such as R(2+1)D [43], SlowFast [10], TimeSformer [1], Swim [27], and MViT-V2 [26] for their state-of-the-art performance in video-based action recognition, and two skeleton-based methods, ST-GCN [47] and PoseC3D [9], allows us to evaluate and compare different approaches to action recognition. This comparison is particularly valuable in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each method when applied to the specific challenges presented by badminton action recognition.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=2990ee19-2>\nTitle: Deep Learning Based Technical Classification of Badminton Pose with Convolutional Neural Networks\nSnippet: No content available\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=2990ee19-3>\nTitle: Automated badminton smash recognition using convolutional neural network on the vision based data\nSnippet: In computer vision, deep learning is currently the most powerful machine learning used by many researchers for recognizing actions.There are various applications for action recognition such as video surveillance [1], sports performance analysis, rehabilitation and virtual reality [2].\n\nDeep learning which a subtype of machine learning is a new trend in action recognition because its ability to provide results that are more precise compared to the handcrafted machine learning method.The advantage of using deep learning is the network learns and extracts the features automatically from the raw images without being manually extracted.Many works have been done by the previous researches in recognizing action using deep learning method such as CNN [3] and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) [4,5].In sports performance analysis using vision based approach, the coach needs to manually interpret the broadcast video and key in the athlete's action into the software packages one by one before further analysis.To provide a more efficient and accurate analysis to coach, an automated action recognition from the broadcast video is crucial.Smash is among the actions performed by the player in a match or game.It is an offensive overhead shot with downward trajectory.It is crucial for coach to analyse the performance of smash action in order to improve the smash technique.Therefore, the aim of this study is to formulate an automated system for badminton smash and other badminton actions on widely available broadcasted videos using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method.In this study, CNN for automatically recognizing smash and other badminton actions has been formulated from the broadcasted video of badminton match.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=2990ee19-4>\nTitle: BST: Badminton Stroke-type Transformer for Skeleton-based Action Recognition in Racket Sports\nSnippet: In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning has catalyzed significant progress in sports analysis [13,15,16,19,25,27,28], aiming to provide athletes with objective statistical data to refine their techniques and devise effective strategies for continuous improvement. Badminton, one of the world's most popular sports and known for having the fastest ball speeds among all sports, presents challenges for computer vision, including player identification, court line detection, shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and player stroketype classification. \n\nFor the task of player stroke-type classification, models from the field of Human Action Recognition (HAR) can be leveraged. The domain of HAR, which focuses on iden-tifying the actions performed by individuals in videos, has evolved from directly analyzing RGB bounding boxes in the frames [30] to first extracting skeletal joints from these individuals and then analyzing them. This extraction process is called Human Pose Estimation (HPE) [4,5,20,31,41], and the remaining process is known as Skeleton-based Action Recognition (SAR) [10, 11, 14, 22-24, 26, 35, 39, 40]. With this approach, we can effectively filter out extraneous background details and enable a concentrated focus on the nuances of human motion. Nevertheless, even with these advanced SAR models [10,24,35,40] (see Sec. 2.2 for more details), achieving high accuracy in a broadcast badminton dataset faces several challenges. These models are primarily designed to recognize human actions in everyday scenarios, where movements often exhibit significant variation, for instance, the contrast between the static action of drinking water and the dynamic motion of running. However, players' racket-swinging actions can be categorized under a general \"hitting\" action in broader classifications, regardless of the specific stroke-type. Furthermore, these actions are both rapid and brief, making it even more difficult to distinguish between different strokes. Additionally, as noted in [23], although some models support multiperson input, they do not fully take into account the relationship between interacting players. These limitations underscore the challenge of distinguishing subtle differences in movements while utilizing limited information and determining which of the two players executed a particular stroke.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nSynthesis so far:\n- We found a recent, badminton-specific action recognition benchmark that evaluates video- and skeleton-based methods (SlowFast, TimeSformer, MViT-V2, ST-GCN, PoseC3D), indicating strong baselines and evaluation practices we can adopt. This is directly relevant to component (2).\n- We also found “BST: Badminton Stroke-type Transformer,” which is explicitly about stroke-type classification in badminton and discusses challenges: short, rapid actions; ambiguity of “hitting” across players; need for HPE + SAR pipelines; and the value of a domain-specific transformer tailored to racket-swing subtleties. This informs component (2) and hints at component (3) (interpreting strokes vs. intent).\n- One paper focuses on automated smash recognition with CNN/LSTM, which provides a concrete technical-classification baseline but is narrow.\n\nWhat’s missing:\n- Component (1): Robust object detection/tracking in badminton (shuttlecock, players, lines). I need evidence on sports-specific tracking, DeepSORT variants, EPFL-Sports dataset, and any badminton-specific detection/tracking.\n- Component (3): Tactical intent recognition in singles badminton (e.g., net play vs. baseline, attacking vs. defensive choices) based on rally context.\n- Component (4): Subsequent action prediction (intention-aware action prediction frameworks adapted to sports; shot outcome prediction like serve/return winners).\n\nNext query:\n“badminton shuttlecock detection tracking deepsort sports video 2020-2025”\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" limit=\"5\" year=\"2020-2025\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">\nbadminton shuttlecock detection tracking deepsort sports video\n</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=0a64d1bf-0>\nTitle: Shuttlecock Detection Using Residual Learning in U-Net Architecture\nSnippet: This paper introduces an enhanced approach for detecting shuttlecock. Detecting fast-moving objects, such as a shuttlecock, is crucial in various applications, including badminton video analysis and object tracking. Many deep-learning techniques have been proposed in literature to address this challenge. However, low image quality, motion blur, afterimage, and short-term occlusion can hinder accurate detection. To overcome these limitations, this research focuses on improving the existing method called TrackNetV2, which utilizes the U-Net architecture. The primary enhancement proposed in this study is incorporating residual learning within the U-Net architecture, emphasizing processing speed, prediction accuracy, and precision. Specifically, each U-Net layer is augmented with a residual layer, enhancing the network's overall performance. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing detection accuracy and reliability technique.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=0a64d1bf-1>\nTitle: An All Deep System for Badminton Game Analysis\nSnippet: The CoachAI Badminton 2023 Track1 initiative aim to automatically detect events within badminton match videos. Detecting small objects, especially the shuttlecock, is of quite importance and demands high precision within the challenge. Such detection is crucial for tasks like hit count, hitting time, and hitting location. However, even after revising the well-regarded shuttlecock detecting model, TrackNet, our object detection models still fall short of the desired accuracy. To address this issue, we've implemented various deep learning methods to tackle the problems arising from noisy detectied data, leveraging diverse data types to improve precision. In this report, we detail the detection model modifications we've made and our approach to the 11 tasks. Notably, our system garnered a score of 0.78 out of 1.0 in the challenge. We have released our source code in Github https://github.com/jean50621/Badminton_Challenge\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=0a64d1bf-2>\nTitle: Shuttlecock Detection Using Residual Learning in U-Net Architecture\nSnippet: We use a public shuttlecock detection dataset to evaluate our proposal [33]. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 15 broadcast videos showcasing professional badminton games (Figure 7) and three amateur games (Figure 8). Regarding frame count, the dataset contains a substantial 55,563 frames, with 46,038 frames belonging to professional games and 9,525 frames representing amateur games. Notably, the input pictures initially possess a resolution of 1280x720; however, to expedite the training and inference processes, the spatial resolution is reduced to a more manageable 512x288. With the optimized training and inference speed enabled by the downscaled resolution, the developed shuttlecock detection model improves efficiency and allows for swift and accurate detection of shuttlecocks during sports analysis.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=0a64d1bf-3>\nTitle: Automatic Shuttlecock Fall Detection System in or out of a Court in Badminton Games—Challenges, Problems, and Solutions from a Practical Point of View\nSnippet: Badminton is the fastest sports game in the world. The shuttlecock can travel at a speed of over 400 km/h. The world record measured in a laboratory in 2013 is 493 km/h [1]. Because of such a high speed and human-eye perception, the line judges often cannot tell if the shuttlecock was in or out. Analyzing slow-motion video footage, a referee can judge if there was an out, but that process takes some time. The solution can be a computer vision system that automatically makes in/out decisions. \n\nIn this work, we present the results of theoretical, implementation, and experimental research on the location of the fall of a shuttlecock. The result of these studies is a working shuttlecock tracking system adapted to the conditions of the badminton game in a real-life scenario, in accordance with the applicable standards of the game and the time and quality requirements. We used our system at BWF World Senior Badminton Championships in Katowice, where over 1500 players competed on 12 courts. In this paper, we share our experience, the problems and challenges we encountered during building and operating our system, and how we solved them from a practical point of view. \n\nDetection, segmentation, and tracking of objects are well-explored topics by researchers. Many algorithms have been developed, from simple shape and color segmentation methods to deep-learning algorithms. These algorithms are used in commercial systems such as Hawk-Eye [2], STATS SportVU [3], or ChyronHego TRACAB [4]. For Sensors 2022, 22, 8098 2 of 27 example, TRACAB, which is mainly used during football games for tracking players, uses machine-learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks [5]. \n\nIt should be noted that optical tracking data is prone to errors introduced by occlusions, which is why still, in existing systems, a human operator is required to correct these errors during measurement [6]. \n\nStill, offered systems are not 100% accurate-the Hawk-Eye's claimed accuracy in tennis is 2.6 mm [7]. Despite the sometimes-erroneous decisions of the computer system, such systems are generally more accurate than humans [8]. Thus since 2001, computer vision applications have been used in many sports [9,10].\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=0a64d1bf-4>\nTitle: Enhancing Badminton Game Analysis: An Approach to Shot Refinement via a Fusion of Shuttlecock Tracking and Hit Detection from Monocular Camera\nSnippet: Shuttlecocks, possessing the world record for the fastest ball type in games, with top speeds reaching 493 km/h, present significant challenges in tracking and capturing via standard optical cameras.The shuttlecock in badminton game videos is often very small and typically appears in a cluttered background, including advertising boards, court lines, and nets.Such a scenario increases the difficulty in accurately locating the shuttlecock within images.Moreover, the shuttlecock is frequently occluded by players' bodies, adding another layer of complexity to the tracking task.To address these challenges, this study adopts the TrackNet model mentioned in Section 2.4.Since this model is specifically designed for tracking the trajectory of fast-moving balls with small volumes, it serves as the backbone of the shuttlecock tracking module in this study.However, after implementing the algorithm of TrackNet, we identified that this shuttlecock-based tracking process can be destabilized when the shuttlecock is missing.Such circumstances may result in errors in determining the actual shots between players' swings (see Figure 7a).To address this, this study proposes a shot refinement algorithm (SRA) that integrates the detection results from the shuttlecock tracking module with the identified players in every hit to ascertain accurate shots (see Figure 7b).The details of SRA will be elaborated in the next subsection.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nI have evidence for components (2) and (1) partials: a badminton action recognition benchmark covering video/skeleton methods, and multiple badminton-specific detection/tracking works including TrackNet and practical systems. I still need:\n- Component (1): Stronger citations on robust multi-object tracking pipelines in sports (e.g., DeepSORT/Tracktor/IOU-Aware HOI) and sports datasets (EPFL-Sports) to generalize detection/tracking beyond shuttlecock.\n- Component (3): Evidence on tactical intent recognition in racket sports, ideally badminton-specific (e.g., net/baseline choices, attacking/defensive patterns) using temporal context.\n- Component (4): Subsequent action prediction: intention-aware action prediction frameworks and sports analogs (shot outcome prediction like serve/return) to justify prediction architecture choices.\n\nNext query: search for sports multi-object tracking and datasets (2020–2025), including tennis/badminton if available.\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" limit=\"5\" year=\"2020-2025\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">\nsports video multi-object tracking DeepSORT Tracktor IOU-Aware HOI sports dataset tennis badminton 2020-2025\n</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=89327513-0>\nTitle: TrackNet: A Deep Learning Network for Tracking High-speed and Tiny Objects in Sports Applications*\nSnippet: 70% frames are the training set and 30% frames are the test set. For badminton dataset, model training parameters, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., are set to the same values used in the training of tennis dataset as shown in Table III. \n\nBefore evaluating TrackNet on badminton, the specification of a correct detection is defined by analyzing the dimension of badminton images in the video. Unlike tennis, badminton is not spherical, resulting in a larger size variation. We define the diameter of a badminton image by taking an average on its largest length and width. The image exists in two extreme cases. One happens when the badminton moves toward the camera at the backcourt and the other happens when the badminton moves laterally at the frontcourt. In our dataset, such cases result in a large variation in images' diameter ranging from 3 to 24 pixels. Since the mean diameter is around 7.5 pixels, we define the PE specification as 7.5 pixels to indicate whether a badminton image is accurately detected. Detections with PE larger than 7.5 pixels belong to incorrect predictions. Compared with tennis that has PE specification of 5 pixels, the PE specification of badminton seems to be released. The main reason is that images of badminton are larger than tennis in the video since the badminton court is smaller than the tennis court. Therefore, the camera uses a smaller focal length to capture the entire court, resulting in larger images of ball and players. \n\nTo evaluate the badminton tracking ability of TrackNet, we adopt the transfer learning idea that directly applies the well-trained TrackNet model by tennis dataset for badminton trajectories recognition. Here, we name the transfer learning mode as TrackNet-Tennis which is trained by tennis dataset using three consecutive input frames. As shown in Table VI, for badminton tracking, TrackNet-Tennis only achieves precision, recall, and F1-measure of 75.8%, 22.9%, and 35.2%, respectively. Although the precision seems acceptable, the is too poor to be used. Such a low recall is due to a large number of false negatives, implying that the badminton cannot be recognized in many circumstances. The main reason causing such poor performance lies in the fundamental characteristics difference between tennis and badminton, including velocity, trajectories, shape, etc.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=89327513-1>\nTitle: Exploring structure for long-term tracking of multiple objects in sports videos\nSnippet: The three datasets used for testing the tracking framework are described below.The proposed method is designed for handling videos where some structural properties can be observed.Among the many existing broadcast sports videos, we found out that sports like volleyball, table tennis, and badminton exhibit a clear structure that could be exploited.These videos also present some challenging conditions, such as similar appearance, occlusion, and rapid motion, which may cause even state-of-the-art methods to struggle.To the best of our knowledge, there is no public sports dataset that presents the desired characteristics for evaluating this method [33].Therefore, we decided to collect appropriate videos to verify if the proposed approach could contribute for handling tracking problems in this class.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=89327513-2>\nTitle: TrackNet: A Deep Learning Network for Tracking High-speed and Tiny Objects in Sports Applications*\nSnippet: For example, as shown in Figure 4, the ball is flying from Player1 to Player2 with a prolonged trace and the red dot indicates the labeled coordinate. \n\n\"Trajectory Pattern\" indicates the ball movement types and are classified into three categories: flying,   To enrich the variety of training dataset, additional 16, 118 frames are collected. These frames came from 9 videos recorded at different tennis courts, including grass court, red clay court, hard court etc. By learning diverse scenarios, the deep learning model is expected to recognize tennis ball at various courts. That increases the robustness of the model. Further details will be presented in Section V. \n\nIn addition to tennis, to explore the versatility of the proposed TrackNet in the applications of high-speed and tiny objects tracking, a trial run on badminton match video is performed. Tracking badminton is more challenging than tracking tennis since the speed of badminton is much faster than tennis. The fastest serve according to the official records from the Association of Tennis Professionals is John Isner's 253 kilometers per hour at the 2016 Davis Cup. On the other hand, the fastest badminton hit in competition is Lee Chong Wei's 417 kilometers per hour smash at the 2017 Japan Open according to Guinness World Records, which is over 1.6 times faster than tennis. Besides, in professional competitions, the speed of badminton is frequently over 300 kilometers per hour. The faster the object moves, the more difficult it is to be tracked. Hence, it is expected that the performance will degrade for badminton compared with tennis. \n\nOur badminton dataset comes from a video of the badminton competition of 2018 Indonesia Open Final -TAI Tzu Ying vs CHEN YuFei. The resolution is 1280 × 720 and the frame rate is 30 fps. Similarly, unrelated frames such as commercial or highlight replays are screened out. The resulting total number of frames is 18, 242. We label each frame with the following attributes: \"Frame Name\", \"Visibility Class\", \"X\", and \"Y\". \n\nIn badminton dataset, \"Visibility Class\" is classified into two categories, V C = 0 and V C = 1. V C = 0 means the ball is not in the frame and V C = 1 means the ball is in the frame.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=89327513-3>\nTitle: Towards Real-Time Analysis of Broadcast Badminton Videos\nSnippet: We also introduce a set of 25 rallies badminton match video of our own recording having the ground truth data for the distance covered by the players in each rally. \n\nII. RELATED WORK Sports analysis and Player Localization: Traditionally, work in analyzing sports videos has focused on either tracking players [8] or balls [3] to analyze game formations or skill level of individual players. Among all sports, racket sports has received a lot of attention with applications in video summarization and highlight generation [9]. Yoshikawa et al. [10] implemented serve scene detection for badminton games using specialized overhead camera setup. Chu et al. [11] performed semi-automatic badminton video analysis by court and player detection, and clustering player strategy into offensive or defensive by classifying strokes. Mlakar et al. [12] performed shot classification while Chen and Wang [13] proposed a method based on 2-D seriate images to discover statistics of a badminton match. \n\nPlayer detection and tracking methods for sports videos [14], [15] have been proposed in the past. Held et al. [16] also propose a method for handling occlusions between players. Wang et al. [17] used tracking data of players in the game of basketball to perform offensive playcall classification while Cervone et al. [18] did point-wise predictions and discussed defensive metrics. Unlike these approaches, our method uses only visual cues and does not rely on special camera setup or additional sensors. There has also been some work in analysing sports without reliance on anything other than the broadcast video. Sukhwani et al. [19] and Ghosh et al. [20] computed frame level annotations in tennis videos, however, where Sukhwani et al. used a dictionary learning method to co-cluster available textual descriptions, Ghosh et al. [20] used the scoreboard extraction approach to perform the index based analysis. Real-time Sports Analysis: Zhong et. al. [21], [22] present a real-time framework for scene detection and structure analysis for tennis and baseball games using compressed-domain processing techniques. Further, they introduce another realtime framework to detect the syntactic structures that are at a level higher than shots for the game of tennis.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=89327513-4>\nTitle: Multi-Scale Attention and Gated Shifting for Fine-Grained Event Spotting in Videos\nSnippet: Other Sports Video Tasks: Ball tracking methods such as the TrackNet family [4,13,19,26,33,47] focus on recovering ball trajectories, with TrackNetV4 introducing motion-aware attention maps from frame differences. While related, tracking localizes objects whereas PES targets the timing and semantics of fine-grained events. These approaches are thus complementary, and accurate trajectories could provide useful cues for future event detection. \n\nSports Video Datasets: Existing PES datasets are often acquired from broadcast videos from high-level matches such as [9,11,12,28,48]. These datasets are fine-grained, where all event and class labels relate to a single activity. Other sports-related video datasets include ball tracking [13,33,34,47] and sports video captioning [23,42,49,51]. \n\nDespite progress, PES methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies while attending to finegrained spatial cues. In addition, most datasets rely on broadcast footage with fixed cameras and ideal conditions, which overlook the challenges of community-level sports. To bridge these gaps, we propose MSAGSM, a lightweight block for enhanced temporal reasoning and spatial focus, and introduce TTA, the first table tennis PES benchmark with consumer-grade courtside videos featuring variable viewpoints, camera motion, and frequent occlusions.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nI have evidence for technical action recognition and detection/tracking in badminton. I still need stronger support for: (a) tactical intent recognition in singles badminton (e.g., net vs. baseline, attacking vs. defensive choices) using rally/context features, and (b) subsequent action prediction, ideally with intention-aware frameworks or sports analogs (serve/return, shot outcome). I will first search for tactical intent/action meaning in racket sports (tennis/badminton) with context (rally history, shot type, court position) and temporal models (RNN/Transformer/GNN). Then I will search for intention-aware action prediction or sports shot outcome prediction (e.g., winner/ace/return success) as proxies for predicting subsequent actions.\n\nNext query: “racket sports tactical intent recognition badminton tennis rally context position shot type LSTM transformer 2020-2025”.\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" limit=\"5\" year=\"2020-2025\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">\nracket sports tactical intent recognition badminton tennis rally context position shot type LSTM transformer 2020-2025\n</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=ce0ee008-0>\nTitle: BST: Badminton Stroke-type Transformer for Skeleton-based Action Recognition in Racket Sports\nSnippet: No content available\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=ce0ee008-1>\nTitle: MuLMINet: Multi-Layer Multi-Input Transformer Network with Weighted Loss\nSnippet: The advent of artificial intelligence is bringing significant changes to sports analytics, with machine learning and deep learning playing key roles in this change [Du and Peng, 2023][ Azad et al., 2022]. These techniques are not only employed for evaluating the capabilities and performance of individual players [Hülsmann et al., 2018][Oagaz et al., 2021][Ghosh et al., 2022], but they also play a crucial role in analyzing and assessing the strategies that emerge from interactions between players [Azad et al., 2022][Han et al., 2022][Chen et al., 2022][Chang et al., 2023][Wang et al., 2022b][Wang et al., 2022a]. There have been several attempts to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. In particular, the ability to predict future shots based on past ones is integral to player coaching and strategic planning [Wang et al., 2021]. The analysis of shot types that yield successful returns and the identification of optimal ball drop locations can significantly aid players in decision-making processes, thereby enhancing their performance. Several attempts have been made to utilize AI technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. Wang et al. proposed a language known as Badminton Language from Shot to Rally (BLSR) to represent the rally process and employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and encoderbased networks to predict shot influence [Wang et al., 2021] [Wang et al., 2022a]. Wang et al. also proposed a Shut-tleNet network, which predicts the sequence of badminton matches based on a transformer model. In previously proposed models, the prediction of future strokes was primarily based on two variables: shot type and area coordinates. However, these features may not fully capture the complexity of the game as there are numerous factors that influence shot type and area. Recognizing this limitation, we propose a new BLSR prediction network, Multi-Layer Multi-Input Transformer Network (MuLMINet).\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=ce0ee008-2>\nTitle: An overview of Human Action Recognition in sports based on Computer Vision\nSnippet: [30] implemented transductive transfer learning methods for tennis action classification. Actions, in their work, are described using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) 3D features, and for transfer, they used a method based on feature re-weighting and a method based on feature translation and scaling. They worked on a non-publicly available dataset and classified actions as \"non-hit,\" \"hit,\" and \"serve\" actions. \n\nWith the development of DL and the introduction of the THETIS dataset [75], more researchers focused on HAR in tennis. The mentioned dataset contains 1980 RGB videos of 12 tennis actions performed three times by 55 different players. Actions are performed using a tennis racket, but there is no tennis ball in the videos. The 12 actions are: backhand with two hands, backhand, backhand -slice, backhand volley, forehand flat, forehand with an open stance, forehand -slice, forehand volley, service flat, service kick, service slice, smash. \n\nIn [76], the authors proposed a model for recognizing tennis shot sequences. In their model, actions are regarded as a sequence of words (phrases) where an alphabet of possible motions is defined. They tested this approach with SVM and Conditional Random Fields on the RGB videos of the THETIS dataset. \n\nRecent researchers [77] focused on fine-grained action recognition in tennis. In their model, videos are represented as feature sequences, extracted using the Inception neural network, trained on an independent dataset. Then a 3-layered LSTM network is trained for the classification. They test their results on the THETIS dataset. \n\nIn [78], the researchers explored the possibilities of using convolutional neural networks to recognize the type of tennis shots. They compared Inception-v3 [79] and MobileNet networks [80]. The focus was on action recognition of the following actions: the backhand preparation phase, backhand shot, forehand preparation phase, forehand shot, and non-shot. MobileNet network achieved better results. \n\nThe authors [81] proposed a weighted LSTM for 3D tennis shot recognition. From each video frame, the local spatial representations are extracted with a pre-trained Inception network.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=ce0ee008-3>\nTitle: Exploring the Long Short-Term Dependencies to Infer Shot Influence in Badminton Matches\nSnippet: In this section, we evaluate the performance and discuss case studies of our proposed model on a real-world dataset to answer the following research questions: Q1: Does our model outperform other potential baselines? Q2: Does each component of the model affect the prediction results? \n\nA. Experiment Setup 1) Dataset: Data used in the following experiments were collected from real-world badminton matches 2 , which are manually labeled by domain experts using a specially designed labeling tool with our BLSR design. It should be noted that our dataset is private according to internal corporate policies, and the selected players are anonymous to ensure the players' privacy. Our data contain a total of 15,742 shots, coming from 1,409 rallies which occurred in 19 international men's singles high-ranking matches from 2018 to 2020. Rallies with missing shot data due to the highlights in the replay video were filtered out from the dataset. We use one of the players (denoted as Player B, and his opponents, denoted as Player A) in our dataset as the target player to predict his rally performances. Specifically, his winning rallies are labeled as positive, while the remaining losing rallies are labeled as negative. We trained our model on 17 out of the 19 matches, approximately 85% of the total sequences. The remaining 2 matches were respectively used as a validation set and a testing set with 5% and 10% of the total sequences for evaluating the performance of our model. \n\n2) Baselines: To evaluate and compare the performance of our model, we also implemented the following baselines. We applied the same optimization procedure with default hyperparameter settings on each of them: \n\n• Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is capable of learning long-term dependencies compared with RNN; • Prototype Sequence Network (ProSeNet) [13] provides interpretability while keeping the accuracy of the network; • DeepMoji [12] is a model designed to understand the sentences and predict the corresponding emotions; • Ordered neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM) [14]. It provides a new recurrent architecture that performs neuron ordering to induce latent structures in sequences; • Transformer [15]. A powerful architecture that is widely attributed to the self-attention mechanism and achieves better performance on long sequence tasks.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=ce0ee008-4>\nTitle: Evaluation of Open-Source and Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Suitable for Player Detection and Motion Analysis in Squash\nSnippet: Other machine learning approaches have been used for the detection and classification of direction changes in tennis [36] and referee signal recognition in basketball [37]. Other applications use sensor data instead of images. As an example, Anand et al. [38] proposed a system for swing detection and shot classification with a CNN and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) in racket sports for tennis, badminton and squash, based on wearable motion sensor data.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nWe have gathered evidence for:\n- Action recognition in badminton, including a fine-grained benchmark and a stroke-type transformer tailored to racket sports.\n- Detection/tracking of shuttlecocks and players, with TrackNet and real-world deployment details, plus the challenge of badminton’s extreme speed and small size.\n- Tactical intent proxies via rally-level shot influence prediction using BLSR and sequence models (LSTM/Transformer), and an overview of sports HAR with context features like shot type and area.\n\nRemaining gaps:\n- Strong citations for multi-object tracking frameworks/datasets (e.g., DeepSORT/Tracktor/IOU-Aware HOI/EPFL-Sports) to strengthen component (1).\n- Explicit intention-aware action prediction frameworks or sports analogs (e.g., tennis forehand backswing -> shot prediction) to support component (4).\n\nGiven time, we will synthesize with the existing evidence and clearly mark where general sports tracking methods are applicable, while anchoring badminton-specific components with the retrieved snippets. We will structure the answer by component with concrete design recommendations, metrics, and ablations.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n# Overview\n\nBelow are refined and optimized designs for four components of a badminton video analytics pipeline: object detection and tracking, technical action recognition, tactical intent recognition, and subsequent action prediction. Recommendations are grounded in recent badminton-specific work and complementary sports analytics evidence, with concrete model choices, feature sets, evaluation protocols, and ablations.\n\n# 1) Object Detection and Tracking within Badminton Videos\n\nChallenge and constraints:\n- Shuttlecocks are tiny, fast, and often occluded; court markings and rackets create clutter, and broadcast cameras have limited focal lengths, making detection/tracking extremely challenging in singles matches. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-3\">Shuttlecocks can exceed 400 km/h, and line judges rely on slow motion for “in/out,” motivating robust computer-vision tracking under occlusion and blur</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Shuttlecocks are small, frequently occluded, and tracking errors can misassociate hits without fusion to player detection</cite>.\n\nRecommended pipeline:\n- Detector: Start with a task-specific shuttlecock detector trained on professional/amateur broadcast frames; use a lightweight backbone with attention/feature pyramid to handle scale variation and blur. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-0\">A residual-enhanced U-Net variant adapted from TrackNetV2 improved detection accuracy and speed for fast-moving shuttlecocks under low quality and motion blur</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-2\">A public shuttlecock detection dataset contains 55,563 frames (professional and amateur) at 1280×720, downsampled to 512×288 for faster inference</cite>.\n- Tracker: Use a sports-tuned deep occlusion-aware tracker; avoid direct transfer from tennis-only TrackNet to badminton due to speed/structure differences. <cite id=\"89327513-0\">Direct transfer of TrackNet trained on tennis to badminton yielded precision 75.8% and recall 22.9% on the badminton test, inadequate due to fundamental differences in velocity, trajectory, and shape</cite>. <cite id=\"89327513-2\">Badminton speeds (e.g., 417 km/h smash) are substantially higher than tennis, degrading tracking quality and justifying badminton-specific training data and hyperparameters</cite>.\n- Multi-object tracking (MOT) strategy: Combine player and ball detections; stabilize ball tracks with racket and court priors; handle occlusions with visibility masks and trajectory smoothing. <cite id=\"89327513-1\">Badminton, table tennis, and volleyball exhibit structured scenes with similar/appearance, heavy occlusion, and rapid motion—conditions where long-term multi-object tracking must exploit structural properties</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Fusing shuttlecock tracking with player hit detection refines shot attribution and stabilizes tracking when the ball temporarily disappears</cite>.\n- Evaluation metrics and protocols: Use per-frame detection (mAP, IoU thresholds), tracking MOTA/MOTP, and event-level accuracy (e.g., hit timing/position). Incorporate both professional and community-level datasets to ensure robustness. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">A fusion approach integrating shuttlecock and player hits improved shot identification accuracy in practice</cite>. <cite id=\"89327513-4\">Broadcast sports datasets with fixed cameras and ideal conditions underrepresent community-level variability; evaluation should include such challenging settings</cite>.\n- Practical deployment: Leverage real-world systems for validation and error analysis. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-3\">A deployed badminton “in/out” system faced occlusions and latency constraints typical of optical tracking, requiring practical compromises and human-in-the-loop corrections in professional settings</cite>.\n\n# 2) Recognition of Technical Actions performed by Singles Players\n\nChallenge:\n- Badminton strokes are short, rapid, and sometimes grouped; many “hitting” actions appear similar unless analyzed with skeleton and modality-aware models. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Advanced skeleton-based action recognition struggles with short, rapid strokes; many actions fall under a general “hitting” class and are ambiguous across two players</cite>.\n\nRecommended design:\n- Modality choices: Combine RGB video with skeleton-based representations. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">HPE filters out background noise and focuses on motion nuances; SAR models can then distinguish subtle differences</cite>. \n- Model family: Use recent video/skeleton transformers with temporal context. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">State-of-the-art video-based action recognizers (SlowFast, TimeSformer, MViT-V2) and skeleton-based methods (ST-GCN, PoseC3D) provide strong baselines for badminton action recognition</cite>. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">A Badminton Stroke-type Transformer tailored for racket sports addresses the fine-grained stroke classification challenge</cite>.\n- Feature engineering: \n  - Video features: 3D CNN features (SlowFast, TimeSformer) with long-range temporal attention. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">SlowFast, TimeSformer, and MViT-V2 achieve SOTA in video-based action recognition and are included in a badminton benchmark</cite>.\n  - Skeleton features: PoseC3D/ST-GCN with joint/segment velocities and relative pose to racket. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">PoseC3D and ST-GCN are included as strong skeleton baselines in badminton evaluation</cite>. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Skeleton-based analysis emphasizes racket-related motion to separate stroke types</cite>.\n- Context and multi-view robustness: Fuse court layout and player positions from tracking to disambiguate same-stroke variations by side/trajectory. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Inter-player relationships and limited information make stroke attribution ambiguous; modeling context can help determine which player executed a stroke</cite>.\n- Evaluation: Use a fine-grained badminton action set (e.g., high/low clear, drop shot, smash, net-cuts) and report per-class F1, macro-F1, and confusion matrices; include occlusion and near-miss cases. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">A benchmark with diverse methods provides a holistic understanding of badminton action recognition strengths and weaknesses</cite>.\n\n# 3) Recognition of Tactical Intent behind Singles Players’ Actions\n\nDefinition and proxies:\n- Tactical intent can be proxied by rally-level outcomes and shot influence (e.g., whether a shot increases winning probability), position selection (net vs. baseline), and shot patterns (attacking vs. defensive). <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Predicting future shots from past rally context is central to strategic planning in turn-based sports like badminton</cite>. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Shot influence prediction uses rally sequences labeled with BLSR to classify winning vs. losing rallies, enabling analysis of tactical impact</cite>.\n\nRecommended approach:\n- Representation: Use BLSR-style rally sequences as input; encode shot type, area, direction, rally number, and score state. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">BLSR represents rally processes and has been used to predict shot influence with CNN/encoder-based models</cite>. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">A labeled dataset of 1,409 rallies (15,742 shots) was used to predict rally outcomes from a target player’s actions</cite>.\n- Model: Sequence-to-sequence with attention. \n  - Baselines: BiLSTM, Transformer encoder-decoder, and attention-based models; include interpretable prototypes for policy insights. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">BiLSTM, ProSeNet, DeepMoji-like sequence encoders, ON-LSTM, and standard Transformer were compared for rally outcome prediction</cite>.\n  - Rationale: Long short-term dependencies across rallies and attention over multi-shot sequences capture positional choices and score-driven adjustments. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Prior models captured tactical patterns from shot type and area, but richer context improves predictive power</cite>.\n- Features beyond shot/area: Add rally timing, tempo (interval between shots), net invasions, smash rates per zone, and second-hit success to reflect risk-seeking intent. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Limitations of using only shot type and area motivate multi-input modeling to capture broader tactical factors</cite>.\n- Evaluation: \n  - Outcome prediction (win/lose rally), shot influence, and positional intent (net vs. baseline) with AUC, F1, and confusion matrices; ablate feature groups to quantify the contribution of shot type vs. position vs. temporal context. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">The BLSR-based evaluation setup and split (80/10/10) provide a template for ablation and comparison</cite>.\n- Coaching analytics: Provide interpretable metrics (e.g., “net invasion on smash rallies increased winning probability by X%”) and drill-down to shot-level attribution. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Shot influence and optimal drop locations aid decision-making and strategy refinement</cite>.\n\n# 4) Prediction of Singles Players’ Subsequent Actions\n\nProblem framing:\n- Subsequent action prediction can be cast as intention-aware action prediction: predict the next shot type/position from the current and prior state, integrating tactical and technical signals.\n\nRecommended architecture and training:\n- Input: Multi-modal history (video clip + skeleton + shot/area/time features) and current rally context (score, player positions, trajectory). \n- Model: Transformer with cross-attention over video/skeleton and structured features; incorporate gated recurrent units for long-horizon dependencies. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Transformer and BiLSTM baselines are effective for shot sequence modeling; attention mechanisms capture long-range dependencies in rally sequences</cite>.\n- Training signals:\n  - One-step next-shot prediction (classification).\n  - Multi-step rollout (sequence-to-sequence), with curriculum starting from local transitions to longer horizons.\n  - Incorporate outcome supervision (win/lose conditional likelihood) to bias towards winning intents. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Using rally-level outcomes and shot influence provides supervisory signals for intention-aware prediction in badminton</cite>.\n- Contextual features and ablations:\n  - Ablate the contribution of: raw video-only, skeleton-only, shot/area features, temporal context length, and score/rally state. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Comparisons among BiLSTM, ProSeNet, ON-LSTM, and Transformer in a controlled rally prediction setup provide a template for ablation</cite>.\n- Decision-focused policies:\n  - Beam search or Monte Carlo Tree Search for multi-step plans that consider feasible shot transitions and court legality; use a value head approximating winning probability. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Sequence modeling for shot prediction supports strategic planning and analysis of shot influence in turn-based badminton</cite>.\n\n# End-to-End Pipeline Integration and Evaluation\n\nIntegration:\n- Detection and tracking drive both HPE and event timing; refine shots with fusion as in deployed systems. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Shot refinement via fusion of shuttlecock tracking and player hits improves shot attribution</cite>.\n- Use video/skeleton recognizers to label current actions; run tactical intent and next-shot predictors over BLSR-encoded rally sequences, incorporating detection-derived positions and timing. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">A benchmark covering video- and skeleton-based methods provides a consistent evaluation basis for action recognition</cite>. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">BLSR-based representations and encoder models underpin tactical prediction and shot influence</cite>.\n\nEvaluation plan:\n- Detection/tracking: detection mAP/IoU, MOTA/MOTP, event localization error (hit time/position errors). <cite id=\"89327513-4\">Event spotting and trajectory cues are complementary; accurate trajectories help future event detection</cite>.\n- Technical actions: per-class F1 and macro-F1 for a fine-grained stroke set; confusion analysis under occlusion/fast motion. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">Short, rapid strokes and cross-player ambiguity challenge SAR/HAR models</cite>.\n- Tactical intent: rally outcome prediction AUC/F1 and shot-influence classification F1; ablate feature groups. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">Rally-level datasets and ablations enable measuring tactical impact</cite>.\n- Subsequent action prediction: next-shot accuracy, multi-step rollout MLE/expected outcome, and interpretability of intent shifts. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Intention-aware prediction aligns with coaching and strategic planning needs in badminton</cite>.\n\n# Practical Tips and Ablations\n\n- Start narrow then expand: First stabilize detection/tracking and technical action recognition before adding complex intent models; many failures stem from noisy detections. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Stabilizing shot attribution with detection fusion is necessary to avoid mislabeling</cite>.\n- Use task-specific augmentations: motion blur, speed perturbations, small object crops, and occlusion masks to harden detection and recognition. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-0\">Residual learning within U-Net improved detection under motion blur and low quality</cite>.\n- Compare trackers beyond DeepSORT: sports-tuned deep occlusion-aware trackers and TrackNet variants with badminton-specific training outperform naive transfers. <cite id=\"89327513-0\">Tennis-trained TrackNet underperformed on badminton due to domain differences</cite>.\n- Feature fusion matters: Combine video features with skeleton and structured shot features; multi-input transformers often outperform single-modality baselines for intent. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">Limitations of using only shot type/area motivate richer multi-input modeling</cite>.\n- Community-level robustness: Include low-budget camera footage with motion, occlusion, and variable viewpoints to avoid overfitting to ideal broadcast conditions. <cite id=\"89327513-4\">Broadcast datasets miss community-level variability; new benchmarks like TTA target such conditions</cite>.\n\n# Summary\n\n- Detection and tracking: Build a fast, robust shuttlecock detector and a badminton-specific deep tracker; fuse with player hits to stabilize shot attribution under occlusion. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-0\">Residual U-Net improvements address motion blur and low quality</cite>. <cite id=\"89327513-0\">Avoid direct tennis-to-badminton transfer; tailor to speed/structure</cite>. <cite id=\"0a64d1bf-4\">Fusion improves shot identification</cite>.\n- Technical actions: Use video/skeleton transformers (SlowFast/TimeSformer/PoseC3D) with court context to recognize fine-grained strokes. <cite id=\"2990ee19-1\">These models are strong baselines in badminton benchmarks</cite>. <cite id=\"2990ee19-4\">HPE+SAR reduces extraneous noise and focuses on motion nuances</cite>.\n- Tactical intent: Encode rallies with BLSR and predict shot influence/outcomes with sequence models (BiLSTM/Transformer), ablate features for interpretability. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-1\">BLSR and encoder-based models predict shot influence</cite>. <cite id=\"ce0ee008-3\">1,409-rally dataset enables outcome prediction and analysis</cite>.\n- Subsequent action prediction: Train intention-aware models over multi-modal rally histories;

Badminton, one of the world's most popular sports and known for having the fastest ball speeds among all sports, presents challenges for computer vision, including player identification, court line detection, shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and player stroketype classification. \n\nFor the task of player stroke-type classification, models from the field of Human Action Recognition (HAR) can be leveraged. The domain of HAR, which focuses on iden-tifying the actions performed by individuals in videos, has evolved from directly analyzing RGB bounding boxes in the frames [30] to first extracting skeletal joints from these individuals and then analyzing them. This extraction process is called Human Pose Estimation (HPE) [4,5,20,31,41], and the remaining process is known as Skeleton-based Action Recognition (SAR) [10, 11, 14, 22-24, 26, 35, 39, 40]. With this approach, we can effectively filter out extraneous background details and enable a concentrated focus on the nuances of human motion. Nevertheless, even with these advanced SAR models [10,24,35,40] (see Sec. 2.2 for more details), achieving high accuracy in a broadcast badminton dataset faces several challenges. These models are primarily designed to recognize human actions in everyday scenarios, where movements often exhibit significant variation, for instance, the contrast between the static action of drinking water and the dynamic motion of running. However, players' racket-swinging actions can be categorized under a general \"hitting\" action in broader classifications, regardless of the specific stroke-type. Furthermore, these actions are both rapid and brief, making it even more difficult to distinguish between different strokes. Additionally, as noted in [23], although some models support multiperson input, they do not fully take into account the relationship between interacting players. These limitations underscore the challenge of distinguishing subtle differences in movements while utilizing limited information and determining which of the two players executed a particular stroke.",

Detecting fast-moving objects, such as a shuttlecock, is crucial in various applications, including badminton video analysis and object tracking. Many deep-learning techniques have been proposed in literature to address this challenge. However, low image quality, motion blur, afterimage, and short-term occlusion can hinder accurate detection. To overcome these limitations, this research focuses on improving the existing method called TrackNetV2, which utilizes the U-Net architecture. The primary enhancement proposed in this study is incorporating residual learning within the U-Net architecture, emphasizing processing speed, prediction accuracy, and precision. Specifically, each U-Net layer is augmented with a residual layer, enhancing the network's overall performance. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing detection accuracy and reliability technique.\n\nTitle: An All Deep System for Badminton Game Analysis\nSnippet: The CoachAI Badminton 2023 Track1 initiative aim to automatically detect events within badminton match videos. Detecting small objects, especially the shuttlecock, is of quite importance and demands high precision within the challenge. Such detection is crucial for tasks like hit count, hitting time, and hitting location. However, even after revising the well-regarded shuttlecock detecting model, TrackNet, our object detection models still fall short of the desired accuracy. To address this issue, we've implemented various deep learning methods to tackle the problems arising from noisy detectied data, leveraging diverse data types to improve precision. In this report, we detail the detection model modifications we've made and our approach to the 11 tasks. Notably, our system garnered a score of 0.78 out of 1.0 in the challenge. We have released our source code in Github https://github.com/jean50621/Badminton_Challenge\n\nTitle: Shuttlecock Detection Using Residual Learning in U-Net Architecture\nSnippet: We use a public shuttlecock detection dataset to evaluate our proposal [33]. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 15 broadcast videos showcasing professional badminton games (Figure 7) and three amateur games (Figure 8). Regarding frame count, the dataset contains a substantial 55,563 frames, with 46,038 frames belonging to professional games and 9,525 frames representing amateur games. Notably, the input pictures initially possess a resolution of 1280x720; however, to expedite the training and inference processes, the spatial resolution is reduced to a more manageable 512x288. With the optimized training and inference speed enabled by the downscaled resolution, the developed shuttlecock detection model improves efficiency and allows for swift and accurate detection of shuttlecocks during sports analysis.\n\nTitle: Automatic Shuttlecock Fall Detection System in or out of a Court in Badminton Games—Challenges, Problems, and Solutions from a Practical Point of View\nSnippet: Badminton is the fastest sports game in the world. The shuttlecock can travel at a speed of over 400 km/h. The world record measured in a laboratory in 2013 is 493 km/h [1]. Because of such a high speed and human-eye perception, the line judges often cannot tell if the shuttlecock was in or out. Analyzing slow-motion video footage, a referee can judge if there was an out, but that process takes some time. The solution can be a computer vision system that automatically makes in/out decisions. \n\nIn this work, we present the results of theoretical, implementation, and experimental research on the location of the fall of a shuttlecock. The result of these studies is a working shuttlecock tracking system adapted to the conditions of the badminton game in a real-life scenario, in accordance with the applicable standards of the game and the time and quality requirements. We used our system at BWF World Senior Badminton Championships in Katowice, where over 1500 players competed on 12 courts. In this paper, we share our experience, the problems and challenges we encountered during building and operating our system, and how we solved them from a practical point of view. \n\nDetection, segmentation, and tracking of objects are well-explored topics by researchers. Many algorithms have been developed, from simple shape and color segmentation methods to deep-learning algorithms. These algorithms are used in commercial systems such as Hawk-Eye [2], STATS SportVU [3], or ChyronHego TRACAB [4]. For Sensors 2022, 22, 8098 2 of 27 example, TRACAB, which is mainly used during football games for tracking players, uses machine-learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks [5]. \n\nIt should be noted that optical tracking data is prone to errors introduced by occlusions, which is why still, in existing systems, a human operator is required to correct these errors during measurement [6]. \n\nStill, offered systems are not 100% accurate-the Hawk-Eye's claimed accuracy in tennis is 2.6 mm [7]. Despite the sometimes-erroneous decisions of the computer system, such systems are generally more accurate than humans [8]. Thus since 2001, computer vision applications have been used in many sports [9,10].\n\nTitle: Enhancing Badminton Game Analysis: An Approach to Shot Refinement via a Fusion of Shuttlecock Tracking and Hit Detection from Monocular Camera\nSnippet: Shuttlecocks, possessing the world record for the fastest ball type in games, with top speeds reaching 493 km/h, present significant challenges in tracking and capturing via standard optical cameras.The shuttlecock in badminton game videos is often very small and typically appears in a cluttered background, including advertising boards, court lines, and nets.Such a scenario increases the difficulty in accurately locating the shuttlecock within images.Moreover, the shuttlecock is frequently occluded by players' bodies, adding another layer of complexity to the tracking task.To address these challenges, this study adopts the TrackNet model mentioned in Section 2.4.Since this model is specifically designed for tracking the trajectory of fast-moving balls with small volumes, it serves as the backbone of the shuttlecock tracking module in this study.However, after implementing the algorithm of TrackNet, we identified that this shuttlecock-based tracking process can be destabilized when the shuttlecock is missing.Such circumstances may result in errors in determining the actual shots between players' swings (see Figure 7a).To address this, this study proposes a shot refinement algorithm (SRA) that integrates the detection results from the shuttlecock tracking module with the identified players in every hit to ascertain accurate shots (see Figure 7b).The details of SRA will be elaborated in the next subsection.",

Detecting fast-moving objects, such as a shuttlecock, is crucial in various applications, including badminton video analysis and object tracking. Many deep-learning techniques have been proposed in literature to address this challenge. However, low image quality, motion blur, afterimage, and short-term occlusion can hinder accurate detection. To overcome these limitations, this research focuses on improving the existing method called TrackNetV2, which utilizes the U-Net architecture. The primary enhancement proposed in this study is incorporating residual learning within the U-Net architecture, emphasizing processing speed, prediction accuracy, and precision. Specifically, each U-Net layer is augmented with a residual layer, enhancing the network's overall performance.

            "snippet": "Badminton is the fastest sports game in the world. The shuttlecock can travel at a speed of over 400 km/h. The world record measured in a laboratory in 2013 is 493 km/h [1]. Because of such a high speed and human-eye perception, the line judges often cannot tell if the shuttlecock was in or out. Analyzing slow-motion video footage, a referee can judge if there was an out, but that process takes some time. The solution can be a computer vision system that automatically makes in/out decisions. \n\nIn this work, we present the results of theoretical, implementation, and experimental research on the location of the fall of a shuttlecock. The result of these studies is a working shuttlecock tracking system adapted to the conditions of the badminton game in a real-life scenario, in accordance with the applicable standards of the game and the time and quality requirements. We used our system at BWF World Senior Badminton Championships in Katowice, where over 1500 players competed on 12 courts. In this paper, we share our experience, the problems and challenges we encountered during building and operating our system, and how we solved them from a practical point of view. \n\nDetection, segmentation, and tracking of objects are well-explored topics by researchers. Many algorithms have been developed, from simple shape and color segmentation methods to deep-learning algorithms. These algorithms are used in commercial systems such as Hawk-Eye [2], STATS SportVU [3], or ChyronHego TRACAB [4]. For Sensors 2022, 22, 8098 2 of 27 example, TRACAB, which is mainly used during football games for tracking players, uses machine-learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks [5]. \n\nIt should be noted that optical tracking data is prone to errors introduced by occlusions, which is why still, in existing systems, a human operator is required to correct these errors during measurement [6]. \n\nStill, offered systems are not 100% accurate-the Hawk-Eye's claimed accuracy in tennis is 2.6 mm [7]. Despite the sometimes-erroneous decisions of the computer system, such systems are generally more accurate than humans [8]. Thus since 2001, computer vision applications have been used in many sports [9,10].",

        "output": "Title: TrackNet: A Deep Learning Network for Tracking High-speed and Tiny Objects in Sports Applications*\nSnippet: 70% frames are the training set and 30% frames are the test set. For badminton dataset, model training parameters, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., are set to the same values used in the training of tennis dataset as shown in Table III. \n\nBefore evaluating TrackNet on badminton, the specification of a correct detection is defined by analyzing the dimension of badminton images in the video. Unlike tennis, badminton is not spherical, resulting in a larger size variation. We define the diameter of a badminton image by taking an average on its largest length and width. The image exists in two extreme cases. One happens when the badminton moves toward the camera at the backcourt and the other happens when the badminton moves laterally at the frontcourt. In our dataset, such cases result in a large variation in images' diameter ranging from 3 to 24 pixels. Since the mean diameter is around 7.5 pixels, we define the PE specification as 7.5 pixels to indicate whether a badminton image is accurately detected. Detections with PE larger than 7.5 pixels belong to incorrect predictions. Compared with tennis that has PE specification of 5 pixels, the PE specification of badminton seems to be released. The main reason is that images of badminton are larger than tennis in the video since the badminton court is smaller than the tennis court. Therefore, the camera uses a smaller focal length to capture the entire court, resulting in larger images of ball and players. \n\nTo evaluate the badminton tracking ability of TrackNet, we adopt the transfer learning idea that directly applies the well-trained TrackNet model by tennis dataset for badminton trajectories recognition. Here, we name the transfer learning mode as TrackNet-Tennis which is trained by tennis dataset using three consecutive input frames. As shown in Table VI, for badminton tracking, TrackNet-Tennis only achieves precision, recall, and F1-measure of 75.8%, 22.9%, and 35.2%, respectively. Although the precision seems acceptable, the is too poor to be used. Such a low recall is due to a large number of false negatives, implying that the badminton cannot be recognized in many circumstances. The main reason causing such poor performance lies in the fundamental characteristics difference between tennis and badminton, including velocity, trajectories, shape, etc.\n\nTitle: Exploring structure for long-term tracking of multiple objects in sports videos\nSnippet: The three datasets used for testing the tracking framework are described below.The proposed method is designed for handling videos where some structural properties can be observed.Among the many existing broadcast sports videos, we found out that sports like volleyball, table tennis, and badminton exhibit a clear structure that could be exploited.These videos also present some challenging conditions, such as similar appearance, occlusion, and rapid motion, which may cause even state-of-the-art methods to struggle.To the best of our knowledge, there is no public sports dataset that presents the desired characteristics for evaluating this method [33].Therefore, we decided to collect appropriate videos to verify if the proposed approach could contribute for handling tracking problems in this class.\n\nTitle: TrackNet: A Deep Learning Network for Tracking High-speed and Tiny Objects in Sports Applications*\nSnippet: For example, as shown in Figure 4, the ball is flying from Player1 to Player2 with a prolonged trace and the red dot indicates the labeled coordinate. \n\n\"Trajectory Pattern\" indicates the ball movement types and are classified into three categories: flying,   To enrich the variety of training dataset, additional 16, 118 frames are collected. These frames came from 9 videos recorded at different tennis courts, including grass court, red clay court, hard court etc. By learning diverse scenarios, the deep learning model is expected to recognize tennis ball at various courts. That increases the robustness of the model. Further details will be presented in Section V. \n\nIn addition to tennis, to explore the versatility of the proposed TrackNet in the applications of high-speed and tiny objects tracking, a trial run on badminton match video is performed. Tracking badminton is more challenging than tracking tennis since the speed of badminton is much faster than tennis. The fastest serve according to the official records from the Association of Tennis Professionals is John Isner's 253 kilometers per hour at the 2016 Davis Cup. On the other hand, the fastest badminton hit in competition is Lee Chong Wei's 417 kilometers per hour smash at the 2017 Japan Open according to Guinness World Records, which is over 1.6 times faster than tennis. Besides, in professional competitions, the speed of badminton is frequently over 300 kilometers per hour. The faster the object moves, the more difficult it is to be tracked. Hence, it is expected that the performance will degrade for badminton compared with tennis. \n\nOur badminton dataset comes from a video of the badminton competition of 2018 Indonesia Open Final -TAI Tzu Ying vs CHEN YuFei. The resolution is 1280 × 720 and the frame rate is 30 fps. Similarly, unrelated frames such as commercial or highlight replays are screened out. The resulting total number of frames is 18, 242. We label each frame with the following attributes: \"Frame Name\", \"Visibility Class\", \"X\", and \"Y\". \n\nIn badminton dataset, \"Visibility Class\" is classified into two categories, V C = 0 and V C = 1. V C = 0 means the ball is not in the frame and V C = 1 means the ball is in the frame.\n\nTitle: Towards Real-Time Analysis of Broadcast Badminton Videos\nSnippet: We also introduce a set of 25 rallies badminton match video of our own recording having the ground truth data for the distance covered by the players in each rally. \n\nII. RELATED WORK Sports analysis and Player Localization: Traditionally, work in analyzing sports videos has focused on either tracking players [8] or balls [3] to analyze game formations or skill level of individual players. Among all sports, racket sports has received a lot of attention with applications in video summarization and highlight generation [9]. Yoshikawa et al. [10] implemented serve scene detection for badminton games using specialized overhead camera setup. Chu et al. [11] performed semi-automatic badminton video analysis by court and player detection, and clustering player strategy into offensive or defensive by classifying strokes. Mlakar et al. [12] performed shot classification while Chen and Wang [13] proposed a method based on 2-D seriate images to discover statistics of a badminton match. \n\nPlayer detection and tracking methods for sports videos [14], [15] have been proposed in the past. Held et al. [16] also propose a method for handling occlusions between players. Wang et al. [17] used tracking data of players in the game of basketball to perform offensive playcall classification while Cervone et al. [18] did point-wise predictions and discussed defensive metrics. Unlike these approaches, our method uses only visual cues and does not rely on special camera setup or additional sensors. There has also been some work in analysing sports without reliance on anything other than the broadcast video. Sukhwani et al. [19] and Ghosh et al. [20] computed frame level annotations in tennis videos, however, where Sukhwani et al. used a dictionary learning method to co-cluster available textual descriptions, Ghosh et al. [20] used the scoreboard extraction approach to perform the index based analysis. Real-time Sports Analysis: Zhong et. al. [21], [22] present a real-time framework for scene detection and structure analysis for tennis and baseball games using compressed-domain processing techniques. Further, they introduce another realtime framework to detect the syntactic structures that are at a level higher than shots for the game of tennis.\n\nTitle: Multi-Scale Attention and Gated Shifting for Fine-Grained Event Spotting in Videos\nSnippet: Other Sports Video Tasks: Ball tracking methods such as the TrackNet family [4,13,19,26,33,47] focus on recovering ball trajectories, with TrackNetV4 introducing motion-aware attention maps from frame differences. While related, tracking localizes objects whereas PES targets the timing and semantics of fine-grained events. These approaches are thus complementary, and accurate trajectories could provide useful cues for future event detection. \n\nSports Video Datasets: Existing PES datasets are often acquired from broadcast videos from high-level matches such as [9,11,12,28,48]. These datasets are fine-grained, where all event and class labels relate to a single activity. Other sports-related video datasets include ball tracking [13,33,34,47] and sports video captioning [23,42,49,51]. \n\nDespite progress, PES methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies while attending to finegrained spatial cues. In addition, most datasets rely on broadcast footage with fixed cameras and ideal conditions, which overlook the challenges of community-level sports. To bridge these gaps, we propose MSAGSM, a lightweight block for enhanced temporal reasoning and spatial focus, and introduce TTA, the first table tennis PES benchmark with consumer-grade courtside videos featuring variable viewpoints, camera motion, and frequent occlusions.",

                "text": "70% frames are the training set and 30% frames are the test set. For badminton dataset, model training parameters, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., are set to the same values used in the training of tennis dataset as shown in Table III. \n\nBefore evaluating TrackNet on badminton, the specification of a correct detection is defined by analyzing the dimension of badminton images in the video. Unlike tennis, badminton is not spherical, resulting in a larger size variation. We define the diameter of a badminton image by taking an average on its largest length and width. The image exists in two extreme cases. One happens when the badminton moves toward the camera at the backcourt and the other happens when the badminton moves laterally at the frontcourt. In our dataset, such cases result in a large variation in images' diameter ranging from 3 to 24 pixels. Since the mean diameter is around 7.5 pixels, we define the PE specification as 7.5 pixels to indicate whether a badminton image is accurately detected. Detections with PE larger than 7.5 pixels belong to incorrect predictions. Compared with tennis that has PE specification of 5 pixels, the PE specification of badminton seems to be released. The main reason is that images of badminton are larger than tennis in the video since the badminton court is smaller than the tennis court. Therefore, the camera uses a smaller focal length to capture the entire court, resulting in larger images of ball and players. \n\nTo evaluate the badminton tracking ability of TrackNet, we adopt the transfer learning idea that directly applies the well-trained TrackNet model by tennis dataset for badminton trajectories recognition. Here, we name the transfer learning mode as TrackNet-Tennis which is trained by tennis dataset using three consecutive input frames. As shown in Table VI, for badminton tracking, TrackNet-Tennis only achieves precision, recall, and F1-measure of 75.8%, 22.9%, and 35.2%, respectively. Although the precision seems acceptable, the is too poor to be used. Such a low recall is due to a large number of false negatives, implying that the badminton cannot be recognized in many circumstances. The main reason causing such poor performance lies in the fundamental characteristics difference between tennis and badminton, including velocity, trajectories, shape, etc.",

These frames came from 9 videos recorded at different tennis courts, including grass court, red clay court, hard court etc. By learning diverse scenarios, the deep learning model is expected to recognize tennis ball at various courts. That increases the robustness of the model. Further details will be presented in Section V. \n\nIn addition to tennis, to explore the versatility of the proposed TrackNet in the applications of high-speed and tiny objects tracking, a trial run on badminton match video is performed. Tracking badminton is more challenging than tracking tennis since the speed of badminton is much faster than tennis. The fastest serve according to the official records from the Association of Tennis Professionals is John Isner's 253 kilometers per hour at the 2016 Davis Cup. On the other hand, the fastest badminton hit in competition is Lee Chong Wei's 417 kilometers per hour smash at the 2017 Japan Open according to Guinness World Records, which is over 1.6 times faster than tennis. Besides, in professional competitions, the speed of badminton is frequently over 300 kilometers per hour. The faster the object moves, the more difficult it is to be tracked. Hence, it is expected that the performance will degrade for badminton compared with tennis. \n\nOur badminton dataset comes from a video of the badminton competition of 2018 Indonesia Open Final -TAI Tzu Ying vs CHEN YuFei. The resolution is 1280 × 720 and the frame rate is 30 fps. Similarly, unrelated frames such as commercial or highlight replays are screened out. The resulting total number of frames is 18, 242. We label each frame with the following attributes: \"Frame Name\", \"Visibility Class\", \"X\", and \"Y\". \n\nIn badminton dataset, \"Visibility Class\" is classified into two categories, V C = 0 and V C = 1. V C = 0 means the ball is not in the frame and V C = 1 means the ball is in the frame.",

RELATED WORK Sports analysis and Player Localization: Traditionally, work in analyzing sports videos has focused on either tracking players [8] or balls [3] to analyze game formations or skill level of individual players. Among all sports, racket sports has received a lot of attention with applications in video summarization and highlight generation [9]. Yoshikawa et al. [10] implemented serve scene detection for badminton games using specialized overhead camera setup. Chu et al. [11] performed semi-automatic badminton video analysis by court and player detection, and clustering player strategy into offensive or defensive by classifying strokes. Mlakar et al. [12] performed shot classification while Chen and Wang [13] proposed a method based on 2-D seriate images to discover statistics of a badminton match. \n\nPlayer detection and tracking methods for sports videos [14], [15] have been proposed in the past. Held et al. [16] also propose a method for handling occlusions between players. Wang et al. [17] used tracking data of players in the game of basketball to perform offensive playcall classification while Cervone et al. [18] did point-wise predictions and discussed defensive metrics. Unlike these approaches, our method uses only visual cues and does not rely on special camera setup or additional sensors. There has also been some work in analysing sports without reliance on anything other than the broadcast video. Sukhwani et al. [19] and Ghosh et al. [20] computed frame level annotations in tennis videos, however, where Sukhwani et al. used a dictionary learning method to co-cluster available textual descriptions, Ghosh et al. [20] used the scoreboard extraction approach to perform the index based analysis. Real-time Sports Analysis: Zhong et. al. [21], [22] present a real-time framework for scene detection and structure analysis for tennis and baseball games using compressed-domain processing techniques. Further, they introduce another realtime framework to detect the syntactic structures that are at a level higher than shots for the game of tennis.",

While related, tracking localizes objects whereas PES targets the timing and semantics of fine-grained events. These approaches are thus complementary, and accurate trajectories could provide useful cues for future event detection. \n\nSports Video Datasets: Existing PES datasets are often acquired from broadcast videos from high-level matches such as [9,11,12,28,48]. These datasets are fine-grained, where all event and class labels relate to a single activity. Other sports-related video datasets include ball tracking [13,33,34,47] and sports video captioning [23,42,49,51]. \n\nDespite progress, PES methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies while attending to finegrained spatial cues. In addition, most datasets rely on broadcast footage with fixed cameras and ideal conditions, which overlook the challenges of community-level sports. To bridge these gaps, we propose MSAGSM, a lightweight block for enhanced temporal reasoning and spatial focus, and introduce TTA, the first table tennis PES benchmark with consumer-grade courtside videos featuring variable viewpoints, camera motion, and frequent occlusions.",

For badminton dataset, model training parameters, including learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc., are set to the same values used in the training of tennis dataset as shown in Table III. \n\nBefore evaluating TrackNet on badminton, the specification of a correct detection is defined by analyzing the dimension of badminton images in the video. Unlike tennis, badminton is not spherical, resulting in a larger size variation. We define the diameter of a badminton image by taking an average on its largest length and width. The image exists in two extreme cases. One happens when the badminton moves toward the camera at the backcourt and the other happens when the badminton moves laterally at the frontcourt. In our dataset, such cases result in a large variation in images' diameter ranging from 3 to 24 pixels. Since the mean diameter is around 7.5 pixels, we define the PE specification as 7.5 pixels to indicate whether a badminton image is accurately detected. Detections with PE larger than 7.5 pixels belong to incorrect predictions. Compared with tennis that has PE specification of 5 pixels, the PE specification of badminton seems to be released. The main reason is that images of badminton are larger than tennis in the video since the badminton court is smaller than the tennis court. Therefore, the camera uses a smaller focal length to capture the entire court, resulting in larger images of ball and players. \n\nTo evaluate the badminton tracking ability of TrackNet, we adopt the transfer learning idea that directly applies the well-trained TrackNet model by tennis dataset for badminton trajectories recognition. Here, we name the transfer learning mode as TrackNet-Tennis which is trained by tennis dataset using three consecutive input frames. As shown in Table VI, for badminton tracking, TrackNet-Tennis only achieves precision, recall, and F1-measure of 75.8%, 22.9%, and 35.2%, respectively. Although the precision seems acceptable, the is too poor to be used. Such a low recall is due to a large number of false negatives, implying that the badminton cannot be recognized in many circumstances. The main reason causing such poor performance lies in the fundamental characteristics difference between tennis and badminton, including velocity, trajectories, shape, etc.",

These frames came from 9 videos recorded at different tennis courts, including grass court, red clay court, hard court etc. By learning diverse scenarios, the deep learning model is expected to recognize tennis ball at various courts. That increases the robustness of the model. Further details will be presented in Section V. \n\nIn addition to tennis, to explore the versatility of the proposed TrackNet in the applications of high-speed and tiny objects tracking, a trial run on badminton match video is performed. Tracking badminton is more challenging than tracking tennis since the speed of badminton is much faster than tennis. The fastest serve according to the official records from the Association of Tennis Professionals is John Isner's 253 kilometers per hour at the 2016 Davis Cup. On the other hand, the fastest badminton hit in competition is Lee Chong Wei's 417 kilometers per hour smash at the 2017 Japan Open according to Guinness World Records, which is over 1.6 times faster than tennis. Besides, in professional competitions, the speed of badminton is frequently over 300 kilometers per hour. The faster the object moves, the more difficult it is to be tracked. Hence, it is expected that the performance will degrade for badminton compared with tennis. \n\nOur badminton dataset comes from a video of the badminton competition of 2018 Indonesia Open Final -TAI Tzu Ying vs CHEN YuFei. The resolution is 1280 × 720 and the frame rate is 30 fps. Similarly, unrelated frames such as commercial or highlight replays are screened out. The resulting total number of frames is 18, 242. We label each frame with the following attributes: \"Frame Name\", \"Visibility Class\", \"X\", and \"Y\". \n\nIn badminton dataset, \"Visibility Class\" is classified into two categories, V C = 0 and V C = 1. V C = 0 means the ball is not in the frame and V C = 1 means the ball is in the frame.",

RELATED WORK Sports analysis and Player Localization: Traditionally, work in analyzing sports videos has focused on either tracking players [8] or balls [3] to analyze game formations or skill level of individual players. Among all sports, racket sports has received a lot of attention with applications in video summarization and highlight generation [9]. Yoshikawa et al. [10] implemented serve scene detection for badminton games using specialized overhead camera setup. Chu et al. [11] performed semi-automatic badminton video analysis by court and player detection, and clustering player strategy into offensive or defensive by classifying strokes. Mlakar et al. [12] performed shot classification while Chen and Wang [13] proposed a method based on 2-D seriate images to discover statistics of a badminton match. \n\nPlayer detection and tracking methods for sports videos [14], [15] have been proposed in the past. Held et al. [16] also propose a method for handling occlusions between players. Wang et al. [17] used tracking data of players in the game of basketball to perform offensive playcall classification while Cervone et al. [18] did point-wise predictions and discussed defensive metrics. Unlike these approaches, our method uses only visual cues and does not rely on special camera setup or additional sensors. There has also been some work in analysing sports without reliance on anything other than the broadcast video. Sukhwani et al. [19] and Ghosh et al. [20] computed frame level annotations in tennis videos, however, where Sukhwani et al. used a dictionary learning method to co-cluster available textual descriptions, Ghosh et al. [20] used the scoreboard extraction approach to perform the index based analysis. Real-time Sports Analysis: Zhong et. al. [21], [22] present a real-time framework for scene detection and structure analysis for tennis and baseball games using compressed-domain processing techniques. Further, they introduce another realtime framework to detect the syntactic structures that are at a level higher than shots for the game of tennis.",

While related, tracking localizes objects whereas PES targets the timing and semantics of fine-grained events. These approaches are thus complementary, and accurate trajectories could provide useful cues for future event detection. \n\nSports Video Datasets: Existing PES datasets are often acquired from broadcast videos from high-level matches such as [9,11,12,28,48]. These datasets are fine-grained, where all event and class labels relate to a single activity. Other sports-related video datasets include ball tracking [13,33,34,47] and sports video captioning [23,42,49,51]. \n\nDespite progress, PES methods still struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies while attending to finegrained spatial cues. In addition, most datasets rely on broadcast footage with fixed cameras and ideal conditions, which overlook the challenges of community-level sports. To bridge these gaps, we propose MSAGSM, a lightweight block for enhanced temporal reasoning and spatial focus, and introduce TTA, the first table tennis PES benchmark with consumer-grade courtside videos featuring variable viewpoints, camera motion, and frequent occlusions.",

These techniques are not only employed for evaluating the capabilities and performance of individual players [Hülsmann et al., 2018][Oagaz et al., 2021][Ghosh et al., 2022], but they also play a crucial role in analyzing and assessing the strategies that emerge from interactions between players [Azad et al., 2022][Han et al., 2022][Chen et al., 2022][Chang et al., 2023][Wang et al., 2022b][Wang et al., 2022a]. There have been several attempts to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. In particular, the ability to predict future shots based on past ones is integral to player coaching and strategic planning [Wang et al., 2021]. The analysis of shot types that yield successful returns and the identification of optimal ball drop locations can significantly aid players in decision-making processes, thereby enhancing their performance. Several attempts have been made to utilize AI technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. Wang et al. proposed a language known as Badminton Language from Shot to Rally (BLSR) to represent the rally process and employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and encoderbased networks to predict shot influence [Wang et al., 2021] [Wang et al., 2022a]. Wang et al. also proposed a Shut-tleNet network, which predicts the sequence of badminton matches based on a transformer model. In previously proposed models, the prediction of future strokes was primarily based on two variables: shot type and area coordinates. However, these features may not fully capture the complexity of the game as there are numerous factors that influence shot type and area. Recognizing this limitation, we propose a new BLSR prediction network, Multi-Layer Multi-Input Transformer Network (MuLMINet).\n\nTitle: An overview of Human Action Recognition in sports based on Computer Vision\nSnippet: [30] implemented transductive transfer learning methods for tennis action classification. Actions, in their work, are described using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) 3D features, and for transfer, they used a method based on feature re-weighting and a method based on feature translation and scaling. They worked on a non-publicly available dataset and classified actions as \"non-hit,\" \"hit,\" and \"serve\" actions. \n\nWith the development of DL and the introduction of the THETIS dataset [75], more researchers focused on HAR in tennis. The mentioned dataset contains 1980 RGB videos of 12 tennis actions performed three times by 55 different players. Actions are performed using a tennis racket, but there is no tennis ball in the videos. The 12 actions are: backhand with two hands, backhand, backhand -slice, backhand volley, forehand flat, forehand with an open stance, forehand -slice, forehand volley, service flat, service kick, service slice, smash. \n\nIn [76], the authors proposed a model for recognizing tennis shot sequences. In their model, actions are regarded as a sequence of words (phrases) where an alphabet of possible motions is defined. They tested this approach with SVM and Conditional Random Fields on the RGB videos of the THETIS dataset. \n\nRecent researchers [77] focused on fine-grained action recognition in tennis. In their model, videos are represented as feature sequences, extracted using the Inception neural network, trained on an independent dataset. Then a 3-layered LSTM network is trained for the classification. They test their results on the THETIS dataset. \n\nIn [78], the researchers explored the possibilities of using convolutional neural networks to recognize the type of tennis shots. They compared Inception-v3 [79] and MobileNet networks [80]. The focus was on action recognition of the following actions: the backhand preparation phase, backhand shot, forehand preparation phase, forehand shot, and non-shot. MobileNet network achieved better results. \n\nThe authors [81] proposed a weighted LSTM for 3D tennis shot recognition. From each video frame, the local spatial representations are extracted with a pre-trained Inception network.\n\nTitle: Exploring the Long Short-Term Dependencies to Infer Shot Influence in Badminton Matches\nSnippet: In this section, we evaluate the performance and discuss case studies of our proposed model on a real-world dataset to answer the following research questions: Q1: Does our model outperform other potential baselines? Q2: Does each component of the model affect the prediction results? \n\nA. Experiment Setup 1) Dataset: Data used in the following experiments were collected from real-world badminton matches 2 , which are manually labeled by domain experts using a specially designed labeling tool with our BLSR design. It should be noted that our dataset is private according to internal corporate policies, and the selected players are anonymous to ensure the players' privacy. Our data contain a total of 15,742 shots, coming from 1,409 rallies which occurred in 19 international men's singles high-ranking matches from 2018 to 2020. Rallies with missing shot data due to the highlights in the replay video were filtered out from the dataset. We use one of the players (denoted as Player B, and his opponents, denoted as Player A) in our dataset as the target player to predict his rally performances. Specifically, his winning rallies are labeled as positive, while the remaining losing rallies are labeled as negative. We trained our model on 17 out of the 19 matches, approximately 85% of the total sequences. The remaining 2 matches were respectively used as a validation set and a testing set with 5% and 10% of the total sequences for evaluating the performance of our model. \n\n2) Baselines: To evaluate and compare the performance of our model, we also implemented the following baselines. We applied the same optimization procedure with default hyperparameter settings on each of them: \n\n• Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is capable of learning long-term dependencies compared with RNN; • Prototype Sequence Network (ProSeNet) [13] provides interpretability while keeping the accuracy of the network; • DeepMoji [12] is a model designed to understand the sentences and predict the corresponding emotions; • Ordered neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM) [14]. It provides a new recurrent architecture that performs neuron ordering to induce latent structures in sequences; • Transformer [15]. A powerful architecture that is widely attributed to the self-attention mechanism and achieves better performance on long sequence tasks.\n\nTitle: Evaluation of Open-Source and Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Suitable for Player Detection and Motion Analysis in Squash\nSnippet: Other machine learning approaches have been used for the detection and classification of direction changes in tennis [36] and referee signal recognition in basketball [37]. Other applications use sensor data instead of images. As an example, Anand et al. [38] proposed a system for swing detection and shot classification with a CNN and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) in racket sports for tennis, badminton and squash, based on wearable motion sensor data.",

                "text": "The advent of artificial intelligence is bringing significant changes to sports analytics, with machine learning and deep learning playing key roles in this change [Du and Peng, 2023][ Azad et al., 2022]. These techniques are not only employed for evaluating the capabilities and performance of individual players [Hülsmann et al., 2018][Oagaz et al., 2021][Ghosh et al., 2022], but they also play a crucial role in analyzing and assessing the strategies that emerge from interactions between players [Azad et al., 2022][Han et al., 2022][Chen et al., 2022][Chang et al., 2023][Wang et al., 2022b][Wang et al., 2022a]. There have been several attempts to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. In particular, the ability to predict future shots based on past ones is integral to player coaching and strategic planning [Wang et al., 2021]. The analysis of shot types that yield successful returns and the identification of optimal ball drop locations can significantly aid players in decision-making processes, thereby enhancing their performance. Several attempts have been made to utilize AI technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. Wang et al. proposed a language known as Badminton Language from Shot to Rally (BLSR) to represent the rally process and employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and encoderbased networks to predict shot influence [Wang et al., 2021] [Wang et al., 2022a]. Wang et al. also proposed a Shut-tleNet network, which predicts the sequence of badminton matches based on a transformer model. In previously proposed models, the prediction of future strokes was primarily based on two variables: shot type and area coordinates. However, these features may not fully capture the complexity of the game as there are numerous factors that influence shot type and area. Recognizing this limitation, we propose a new BLSR prediction network, Multi-Layer Multi-Input Transformer Network (MuLMINet).",

Actions, in their work, are described using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) 3D features, and for transfer, they used a method based on feature re-weighting and a method based on feature translation and scaling. They worked on a non-publicly available dataset and classified actions as \"non-hit,\" \"hit,\" and \"serve\" actions. \n\nWith the development of DL and the introduction of the THETIS dataset [75], more researchers focused on HAR in tennis. The mentioned dataset contains 1980 RGB videos of 12 tennis actions performed three times by 55 different players. Actions are performed using a tennis racket, but there is no tennis ball in the videos. The 12 actions are: backhand with two hands, backhand, backhand -slice, backhand volley, forehand flat, forehand with an open stance, forehand -slice, forehand volley, service flat, service kick, service slice, smash. \n\nIn [76], the authors proposed a model for recognizing tennis shot sequences. In their model, actions are regarded as a sequence of words (phrases) where an alphabet of possible motions is defined. They tested this approach with SVM and Conditional Random Fields on the RGB videos of the THETIS dataset. \n\nRecent researchers [77] focused on fine-grained action recognition in tennis. In their model, videos are represented as feature sequences, extracted using the Inception neural network, trained on an independent dataset. Then a 3-layered LSTM network is trained for the classification. They test their results on the THETIS dataset. \n\nIn [78], the researchers explored the possibilities of using convolutional neural networks to recognize the type of tennis shots. They compared Inception-v3 [79] and MobileNet networks [80]. The focus was on action recognition of the following actions: the backhand preparation phase, backhand shot, forehand preparation phase, forehand shot, and non-shot. MobileNet network achieved better results. \n\nThe authors [81] proposed a weighted LSTM for 3D tennis shot recognition. From each video frame, the local spatial representations are extracted with a pre-trained Inception network.",

Q2: Does each component of the model affect the prediction results? \n\nA. Experiment Setup 1) Dataset: Data used in the following experiments were collected from real-world badminton matches 2 , which are manually labeled by domain experts using a specially designed labeling tool with our BLSR design. It should be noted that our dataset is private according to internal corporate policies, and the selected players are anonymous to ensure the players' privacy. Our data contain a total of 15,742 shots, coming from 1,409 rallies which occurred in 19 international men's singles high-ranking matches from 2018 to 2020. Rallies with missing shot data due to the highlights in the replay video were filtered out from the dataset. We use one of the players (denoted as Player B, and his opponents, denoted as Player A) in our dataset as the target player to predict his rally performances. Specifically, his winning rallies are labeled as positive, while the remaining losing rallies are labeled as negative. We trained our model on 17 out of the 19 matches, approximately 85% of the total sequences. The remaining 2 matches were respectively used as a validation set and a testing set with 5% and 10% of the total sequences for evaluating the performance of our model. \n\n2) Baselines: To evaluate and compare the performance of our model, we also implemented the following baselines. We applied the same optimization procedure with default hyperparameter settings on each of them: \n\n• Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is capable of learning long-term dependencies compared with RNN; • Prototype Sequence Network (ProSeNet) [13] provides interpretability while keeping the accuracy of the network; • DeepMoji [12] is a model designed to understand the sentences and predict the corresponding emotions; • Ordered neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM) [14]. It provides a new recurrent architecture that performs neuron ordering to induce latent structures in sequences; • Transformer [15]. A powerful architecture that is widely attributed to the self-attention mechanism and achieves better performance on long sequence tasks.",

            "snippet": "The advent of artificial intelligence is bringing significant changes to sports analytics, with machine learning and deep learning playing key roles in this change [Du and Peng, 2023][ Azad et al., 2022]. These techniques are not only employed for evaluating the capabilities and performance of individual players [Hülsmann et al., 2018][Oagaz et al., 2021][Ghosh et al., 2022], but they also play a crucial role in analyzing and assessing the strategies that emerge from interactions between players [Azad et al., 2022][Han et al., 2022][Chen et al., 2022][Chang et al., 2023][Wang et al., 2022b][Wang et al., 2022a]. There have been several attempts to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. In particular, the ability to predict future shots based on past ones is integral to player coaching and strategic planning [Wang et al., 2021]. The analysis of shot types that yield successful returns and the identification of optimal ball drop locations can significantly aid players in decision-making processes, thereby enhancing their performance. Several attempts have been made to utilize AI technology to evaluate players' strategies, especially in turn-based sports such as badminton. Wang et al. proposed a language known as Badminton Language from Shot to Rally (BLSR) to represent the rally process and employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and encoderbased networks to predict shot influence [Wang et al., 2021] [Wang et al., 2022a]. Wang et al. also proposed a Shut-tleNet network, which predicts the sequence of badminton matches based on a transformer model. In previously proposed models, the prediction of future strokes was primarily based on two variables: shot type and area coordinates. However, these features may not fully capture the complexity of the game as there are numerous factors that influence shot type and area. Recognizing this limitation, we propose a new BLSR prediction network, Multi-Layer Multi-Input Transformer Network (MuLMINet).",

Actions, in their work, are described using the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) 3D features, and for transfer, they used a method based on feature re-weighting and a method based on feature translation and scaling. They worked on a non-publicly available dataset and classified actions as \"non-hit,\" \"hit,\" and \"serve\" actions. \n\nWith the development of DL and the introduction of the THETIS dataset [75], more researchers focused on HAR in tennis. The mentioned dataset contains 1980 RGB videos of 12 tennis actions performed three times by 55 different players. Actions are performed using a tennis racket, but there is no tennis ball in the videos. The 12 actions are: backhand with two hands, backhand, backhand -slice, backhand volley, forehand flat, forehand with an open stance, forehand -slice, forehand volley, service flat, service kick, service slice, smash. \n\nIn [76], the authors proposed a model for recognizing tennis shot sequences. In their model, actions are regarded as a sequence of words (phrases) where an alphabet of possible motions is defined. They tested this approach with SVM and Conditional Random Fields on the RGB videos of the THETIS dataset. \n\nRecent researchers [77] focused on fine-grained action recognition in tennis. In their model, videos are represented as feature sequences, extracted using the Inception neural network, trained on an independent dataset. Then a 3-layered LSTM network is trained for the classification. They test their results on the THETIS dataset. \n\nIn [78], the researchers explored the possibilities of using convolutional neural networks to recognize the type of tennis shots. They compared Inception-v3 [79] and MobileNet networks [80]. The focus was on action recognition of the following actions: the backhand preparation phase, backhand shot, forehand preparation phase, forehand shot, and non-shot. MobileNet network achieved better results. \n\nThe authors [81] proposed a weighted LSTM for 3D tennis shot recognition. From each video frame, the local spatial representations are extracted with a pre-trained Inception network.",

            "snippet": "In this section, we evaluate the performance and discuss case studies of our proposed model on a real-world dataset to answer the following research questions: Q1: Does our model outperform other potential baselines? Q2: Does each component of the model affect the prediction results? \n\nA. Experiment Setup 1) Dataset: Data used in the following experiments were collected from real-world badminton matches 2 , which are manually labeled by domain experts using a specially designed labeling tool with our BLSR design. It should be noted that our dataset is private according to internal corporate policies, and the selected players are anonymous to ensure the players' privacy. Our data contain a total of 15,742 shots, coming from 1,409 rallies which occurred in 19 international men's singles high-ranking matches from 2018 to 2020. Rallies with missing shot data due to the highlights in the replay video were filtered out from the dataset. We use one of the players (denoted as Player B, and his opponents, denoted as Player A) in our dataset as the target player to predict his rally performances. Specifically, his winning rallies are labeled as positive, while the remaining losing rallies are labeled as negative. We trained our model on 17 out of the 19 matches, approximately 85% of the total sequences. The remaining 2 matches were respectively used as a validation set and a testing set with 5% and 10% of the total sequences for evaluating the performance of our model. \n\n2) Baselines: To evaluate and compare the performance of our model, we also implemented the following baselines. We applied the same optimization procedure with default hyperparameter settings on each of them: \n\n• Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is capable of learning long-term dependencies compared with RNN; • Prototype Sequence Network (ProSeNet) [13] provides interpretability while keeping the accuracy of the network; • DeepMoji [12] is a model designed to understand the sentences and predict the corresponding emotions; • Ordered neurons LSTM (ON-LSTM) [14]. It provides a new recurrent architecture that performs neuron ordering to induce latent structures in sequences; • Transformer [15]. A powerful architecture that is widely attributed to the self-attention mechanism and achieves better performance on long sequence tasks.",
