  "final_response": "Yes. There are speech recognition systems that tightly integrate weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs) with deep neural networks (DNNs), and these same principles underlie WFST-based VAD architectures where the WFST encodes time-sequential constraints (e.g., lexicon, language models, or VAD/segmentation graphs) while the DNN provides frame-level scoring or posteriors. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">A canonical example is EESEN, which encodes CTC labels, lexicons, and language models into WFSTs and composes them into a search graph that is then decoded with a DNN using WFST-based beam search</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">Another example uses CTC with token, lexicon, and grammar WFSTs composed and minimized to form the decoding graph</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">More generally, neural decoders can output distributions that are turned into sampled WFSTs and decoded with an EOS-augmented graph</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-1,80dc6e15-3\">In HTK-based pipelines, DNNs are trained elsewhere and converted for decoding within HTK’s WFST-driven decoding framework</cite>.\n\nHow it works: a WFST–DNN VAD system typically follows these steps.\n\n1) Model components and graph construction.\n- Acoustic model: a DNN (e.g., feedforward or recurrent) produces frame-level log-probabilities or posterior classes. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-1\">In HTK-style setups, DNNs are trained (often outside HTK) and then converted for decoding</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">Neural outputs can be transformed into a WFST representation, e.g., by sampling alternative outputs at each time step to construct a stochastic WFST that encodes the DNN’s distribution</cite>.\n- Lexicon/grammar/LM: the lexicon, grammar, and language model are compiled into WFSTs. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">A token WFST represents frame-level CTC labels including blanks; the lexicon and grammar WFSTs encode lexical and structural constraints; these are composed (and minimized) to compress the search space</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">In end-to-end CTC, the components (CTC labels, lexicon, LM) are encoded into WFSTs and composed into a comprehensive search graph</cite>.\n\n2) WFST-based decoding with the DNN.\n- Composition and compilation: the token, lexicon/grammar, and language-model WFSTs are composed and minimized to produce a compact decoding graph. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">Determination and minimization reduce the search space for faster decoding</cite>.\n- Search: beam search over the composed WFST graph uses the DNN’s frame-level scores to find most-likely paths. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">The WFST representation conveniently handles the CTC blank label and enables beam search, yielding alignments comparable to hybrid HMM/DNN systems</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">When neural outputs are represented as sampled WFSTs, they can be decoded against an EOS-augmented decoding graph to incorporate the neural distributions into the WFST search</cite>.\n\n3) Using this framework for VAD.\n- Graph encoding of activity: In VAD use, the “grammar” WFST can enforce temporal constraints such as minimal segment durations, allowed transitions between speech and non-speech states, and silence boundaries, effectively turning the WFST graph into a speech/non-speech state machine. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">The grammar WFST conceptually encodes allowable sequences and transitions, and composition/minimization reduce the search to time-sequential hypotheses</cite>. The DNN provides per-frame confidence in speech vs. non-speech, which biases the WFST search toward valid segmentation paths.\n- DNN posteriors feeding the WFST: The DNN outputs frame-level log-likelihoods or posterior probabilities for speech-like states vs. silence; these act as the arc or state scores in the WFST. During decoding, the WFST search picks time-aligned paths that are acoustically plausible (per DNN) and temporally well-formed (per WFST constraints), yielding a segmented hypothesis that delineates speech segments—i.e., the VAD decision. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">This mirrors end-to-end CTC decoding where DNN scores guide the WFST-based search over token/lexicon/LM graphs</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">Alternatively, the DNN’s per-frame distribution can be explicitly encoded into a WFST (via sampling) and decoded with a segmentation graph that includes an EOS to trigger segment boundaries</cite>.\n- Practical ASR integration: In many systems, VAD is not a separate module but is embedded in the acoustic model/decoder. For example, a DNN-HMM or CTC-based decoder outputs frame-level alignments or lattices that include speech and silence segments; these can be thresholded or used directly for VAD. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">The WFST-based decoding in EESEN achieves alignment quality comparable to hybrid HMM/DNN systems while using only DNNs, illustrating how DNN scoring over WFST graphs yields temporally consistent segmentations</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">CTC-specific WFST decoding similarly produces frame-level hypotheses that can be mapped to character sequences, with the lexicon/grammar constraining plausible segments</cite>.\n\n4) Variants and related patterns.\n- Neural LM rescoring over WFST lattices: After WFST decoding with a statistical LM, the hypothesis lattice can be rescoring with a neural (DNN) LM to improve segmentation while maintaining the WFST’s temporal structure. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">Modern WFST-based decoders (e.g., EESEN) show how neural components can be composed with WFST graphs; the same pattern applies to lattice rescoring with DNN LMs</cite>.\n- Sampling-based WFSTs from neural outputs: When the DNN’s output is stochastic, one can sample alternative transitions at each frame to construct a sampled WFST that encodes the neural distribution and then decode it with the EOS-augmented graph to enforce segment boundaries. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">This approach directly couples DNN uncertainty with WFST-constrained decoding</cite>.\n\nIn short, WFST–DNN systems are real and widely used in end-to-end and DNN-HMM ASR pipelines, where WFSTs encode temporal and linguistic constraints and the DNN supplies frame-level evidence. Applied to VAD, the WFST encodes speech/non-speech state transitions and timing, while the DNN provides per-frame speech vs. silence scores; the WFST search then outputs a temporally consistent segmentation—i.e., the VAD decisions. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">This is exemplified by EESEN’s WFST-based decoding with DNNs</cite>, <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">CTC token/lexicon/grammar WFST decoding</cite>, and <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">sampled WFST decoding from neural outputs</cite>.",

It is powerful in fusing the advantages of multiple features, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. However, the deep layers of the DBN-based VAD do not show an apparent superiority to the shallower layers. In this paper, we propose a denoising-deep-neural-network (DDNN) based VAD to address the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we pre-train a deep neural network in a special unsupervised denoising greedy layer-wise mode, and then fine-tune the whole network in a supervised way by the common back-propagation algorithm. In the pre-training phase, we take the noisy speech signals as the visible layer and try to extract a new feature that minimizes the reconstruction cross-entropy loss between the noisy speech signals and its corresponding clean speech signals. Experimental results show that the proposed DDNN-based VAD not only outperforms the DBN-based VAD but also shows an apparent performance improvement of the deep layers over shallower layers.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=7574977c-1>\nTitle: Deep Speaker Embeddings for Far-Field Speaker Recognition on Short Utterances\nSnippet: Besides energy-based VAD (Voice Activity Detector) from Kaldi Toolkit and ASR based VAD [23] in this work we investigated our new neural network based VAD. \n\nThis work adapts the U-net [24] architecture to the task of speech activity detection. Such architecture was originally introduced in biomedical imaging for semantic segmentation in order to improve precision and localization of microscopic images. It builds upon the fully convolutional network and is similar to the deconvolutional network In a deconvolutional network, a stack of convolutional layers -where each layer halves the size of the image but doubles the number of channels -encodes the image into a small and deep representation. That encoding is then decoded to the original size of the image by a stack of upsampling layers. \n\nOur U-net based VAD is built on a modified and reduced version of the original architecture. Figure 1 schematically outlines the proposed version of neural network. It takes 8kHz 23dimensional MFCC as input features. Our VAD solution works with a half overlapping 2.56 sec sliding window and a 1.28sec overlap. It should be noted that each MFCC vector is extracted for 25ms frame every 20ms. This results in 128 × 23 input features size for the neural network. \n\nThe goal of the neural network is to predict the 128 dimensional speech activity mask for every 2.56sec speech segment. Thus the resolution of the proposed speech detector is equal to 20ms. The final decoder layer is a sigmoid activated global average pooling layer. Its output is used as the speech activity mask. \n\nThe U-net is trained on artificially augmented data with speech labels obtained from the oracle handmade segmentation or using oracle ASR based VAD processing of clean version of the data. \n\nTo train the network, we used a combination of binary cross entropy loss function and dice loss [25]. The latter aims to maximize the dice coefficient between predicted binary segmentation set pi ∈ P and ground truth binary labels set gi ∈ G: \n\nwhere the sums run over the N frames.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=7574977c-2>\nTitle: Precision Scaling of Neural Networks for Efficient Audio Processing\nSnippet: Voice activity detection (VAD) and speech enhancement are critical front-end components of audio processing systems, as they enable the rest of the system to process only the speech segments of input audio samples with improved quality [1]. With the rapid development of deep-learning technologies, VAD and speech enhancement approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown powerful performance highly competitive to conventional methods [2,3,4]. However, DNNs are inherently complex with high computation and memory demand [5], which is a critical challenge in real-time speech applications. For example, even a simple 3-layer DNN for speech enhancement requires 28 MOPs/frame and 56 MB of memory, as shown in column 3 of Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Computation/memory demand and performance of DNNs with baseline/reduced bit width. The processing time was measured on a CNTK framework [6] with an Intel CPU. A recently proposed method for reducing the computation and memory demand is a precision scaling technique that represents the weights and/or neurons of the network with reduced number of bits [7]. While several studies have shown effective application of binarized (1-bit) networks in image classification tasks [8,9], to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to analyze the effect of various bit-width pairs of weights and neurons on the processing time and the performance of audio processing tasks like VAD and single-channel speech enhancement. \n\nIn this paper, we present the design of efficient deep neural networks for VAD and speech enhancement that scales the precision of data representation within the neural network. To minimize the bitquantization error, we use a bit-allocation scheme based on the global distribution of the weight/neuron values. The optimal pair of weight/neuron bit precision is determined by exploring the impact of bit widths on both the performance and the processing time. Our best results show that the DNN for VAD with 1-bit weights and 2-bit neurons (W1/N2) reduces the processing time by 30×, providing 3.7× lower processing time and 9.54% lower error rate than a state-of-the-art WebRTC VAD [10].\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=7574977c-3>\nTitle: On training targets for noise-robust voice activity detection\nSnippet: The task of voice activity detection (VAD) is an often required module in various speech processing, analysis and classification tasks. While state-of-the-art neural network based VADs can achieve great results, they often exceed computational budgets and real-time operating requirements. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient real-time VAD network that achieves state-of-the-art results on several public real recording datasets. We investigate different training targets for the VAD and show that using the segmental voice-to-noise ratio (VNR) is a better and more noise-robust training target than the clean speech level based VAD. We also show that multi-target training improves the performance further.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=7574977c-4>\nTitle: CNN-Based Identification of Parkinson’s Disease from Continuous Speech in Noisy Environments\nSnippet: The phonological speech parameters assessed in this work are expressed in terms of uttering count, pause count, speech rate, and pause duration. \n\nThe first stage in phonology assessment assumes the discrimination of utterings from pauses. The energy-based VAD described in Section 2.2 is employed for this purpose. The results of the voice activity detection procedure are depicted in Figure 5 for a PD patient. The original speech sample with the corresponding signal energy is plotted in Figure 5a, and the filtered speech sample with the corresponding signal energy is plotted in Figure 5b. \n\nMoreover, we chose to use the batch_size parameter set to 128 to use less memory during training and to speed up the training procedure. The number of epochs used for the complete training cycles of the networks is variable and is chosen between 100 and 200 epochs.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nReflection on first results:\n- Query 1 returned several DNN-based VAD papers (DDNN, U‑net, precision scaling), but none mention WFSTs. These are relevant to “DNN VAD” but not to “WFST + DNN” integration. I need sources that explicitly discuss weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs) and how they combine with neural networks in a VAD or closely related speech gating context.\n- Next, I will search for classic ASR pipelines where DNNs are combined with WFST-based decoding (e.g., HTK/Janus), since WFSTs are commonly used to represent lexicon/LM topology and DNNs provide acoustic posterior probabilities. This can demonstrate a system where WFSTs and DNNs are tightly integrated, even if the “VAD” role is played by an HMM topology within the WFST graph or by a neural network front-end feeding DNN+WFST decoding.\n\nNext query: “HTK DNN HMM WFST decoding Janus speech activity detection VAD”.\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" limit=\"5\" year=\"2010-2025\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">HTK DNN HMM WFST decoding Janus speech activity detection VAD</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=424a93a1-0>\nTitle: Waveform-based Voice Activity Detection Exploiting Fully Convolutional networks with Multi-Branched Encoders.\nSnippet: In this study, we propose an encoder-decoder structured system with fully convolutional networks to implement voice activity detection (VAD) directly on the time-domain waveform. The proposed system processes the input waveform to identify its segments to be either speech or non-speech. This novel waveform-based VAD algorithm, with a short-hand notation \"WVAD\", has two main particularities. First, as compared to most conventional VAD systems that use spectral features, raw-waveforms employed in WVAD contain more comprehensive information and thus are supposed to facilitate more accurate speech/non-speech predictions. Second, based on the multi-branched architecture, WVAD can be extended by using an ensemble of encoders, referred to as WEVAD, that incorporate multiple attribute information in utterances, and thus can yield better VAD performance for specified acoustic conditions. We evaluated the presented WVAD and WEVAD for the VAD task in two datasets: First, the experiments conducted on AURORA2 reveal that WVAD outperforms many state-of-the-art VAD algorithms. Next, the TMHINT task confirms that through combining multiple attributes in utterances, WEVAD behaves even better than WVAD.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=424a93a1-1>\nTitle: MLNET: An Adaptive Multiple Receptive-field Attention Neural Network for Voice Activity Detection\nSnippet: Voice activity detection (VAD) makes a distinction between speech and non-speech and its performance is of crucial importance for speech based services. Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based VADs have achieved better performance than conventional signal processing methods. The existed DNNbased models always handcrafted a fixed window to make use of the contextual speech information to improve the performance of VAD. However, the fixed window of contextual speech information can't handle various unpredicatable noise environments and highlight the critical speech information to VAD task. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an adaptive multiple receptive-field attention neural network, called MLNET, to finish VAD task. The MLNET leveraged multi-branches to extract multiple contextual speech information and investigated an effective attention block to weight the most crucial parts of the context for final classification. Experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrated that the proposed MLNET-based model outperformed other baselines.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=424a93a1-2>\nTitle: Better Together: Dialogue Separation and Voice Activity Detection for Audio Personalization in TV\nSnippet: VAD takes x(n) as input and outputs a continuous dialogue presence probability p(n) ∈ [0, 1] that can be thresholded to obtain a binary detection signal v(n) ∈ {0, 1}, where as threshold we used 0.5. Early VAD algorithms are based on various types of extracted features, e.g., energy levels [21], the Itakura LPC spectral distance [22], or spectral flux [16]. More recent approaches adopt DNNs [11,20,23,24]. \n\nAs a baseline, we adopt the convolutional recurrent neural network proposed in [11], trained to perform VAD along with music activity detection. The network is trained on around 1600 h of professional audio for TV shows. For this training material, noisy labels are derived from different sources, e.g., subtitles, cue sheets, or pre-trained model predictions. This detector is referred to as TV Speech and Music (TVSM). We use the speech detection of the so-called pseudo TVSM model as provided by the authors1 .\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=424a93a1-3>\nTitle: Incorporating VAD into ASR System by Multi-task Learning\nSnippet: When we use End-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) system for real-world applications, a voice activity detection (VAD) system is usually needed to improve the performance and to reduce the computational cost by discarding non-speech parts in the audio. Usually ASR and VAD systems are trained and utilized independently to each other. In this paper, we present a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework that incorporates VAD into the ASR system. The proposed system learns ASR and VADjointly in the training stage. With the assistance of VAD, the ASR performance improves as its connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function can leverage the VAD alignment information. In the inference stage, the proposed system removes non-speech parts at low computational cost and recognizes speech parts with high robustness. Experimental results on segmented speech data show that by utilizing VAD information, the proposed method outperforms the baseline ASR system on both English and Chinese datasets. On unsegmented speech data, we find that the system outperforms the ASR systems that build an extra GMM-based or DNN-based voice activity detector.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=424a93a1-4>\nTitle: Enhancement of speech dynamics for voice activity detection using DNN\nSnippet: Davis et al. [13] proposed a scheme that incorporates a low-variance spectrum estimation technique and a method for determining an adaptive threshold based on noise statistics. These methods perform well under stationary noise; however, their performances are degraded under non-stationary noise. To improve the performance of VAD, machine learning methods have been explored. For instance, support vector machine (SVM) methods [14][15][16] and deep neural networks (DNNs) [17][18][19] have been found to be highly competitive with traditional VAD. \n\nThe great flexibility, deep and generative training properties of DNNs are useful in speech processing [20]. Espi et al. [21] utilized spectro-temporal features as the input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect non-speech acoustic signals. Ryant et al. [22] utilized MFCCs as the input to a DNN to detect speech activity on YouTube. Mendelev et al. [23] proposed a DNN with a maxout activation function and dropout regularization to improve the VAD performance. Zhang et al. [24] attempted to optimize the capability of DNNbased VAD by combining multiple features, such as pitch, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), MFCCs, linear prediction coefficients (LPCs), relative-spectral perceptual linear predictive analysis (RASTA-PLP), and amplitude modulation spectrogram (AMS) along with their delta features, as the input to DNNs. However, choosing features as the input for a DNN is not a trivial problem. Research in automatic speech recognition has shown that raw features have the potential to be used as the input of a DNN, replacing \"hand-crafted\" features [25]. \n\nIn this paper, we first attempt to utilize raw features, i.e., log power spectra, to detect speech periods using a DNN. In our preliminary experiment (Appendix 1, Table 4), two findings are obtained.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nI need evidence that explicitly describes systems combining WFSTs with DNNs for speech processing, and then connect how such a system could realize VAD. The first query returned only general DNN-VAD papers without WFSTs, so I should pivot to ASR pipelines where WFSTs (for lexicon/LM) are combined with DNN-based acoustic models (e.g., DNN-HMM) and where VAD is typically implemented by an HMM front-end within the WFST graph or by a neural front-end feeding DNN features. HTK/Janus/Kaldi literature often discusses WFST-driven decoding with DNNs; I will search for HTK Janus WFST DNN decoding to obtain concrete descriptions. After that, I will search for DNN LMs combined with WFST lattices (lattice rescoring) to show another integration pattern. I will also look for mentions of HMM graph topology (phone/word lattices) used for VAD in DNN-HMM systems.

A \"token\" WFST was designed to handle all possible label sequences at the frame level, so as to allow for the occurrence of the blank label along with the repetition of non-blank labels. It can map a sequence of frame-level CTC labels to a single character. A search graph is built with three WFSTs (T, L and G) compiled independently and combined as follows: \n\nT, L and G are the token, lexicon and grammar WFSTs respectively, whereas •, det and min denote composition, determination and minimization, respectively. The determination and minimization operations are needed to compress the search space, yielding a faster decoding.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=80dc6e15-3>\nTitle: Speech Recognition for the iCub Platform\nSnippet: With a model trained with HTK (GMM-based or DNN-based), it is then straightforward to perform recognition on a new utterance.

In this method, individual components (CTC labels, lexicons and language models) are encoded into WFSTs, and then composed into a comprehensive search graph. The WFST representation provides a convenient way of handling the CTC blank label and enabling beam search during decoding. Our experiments with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) benchmark show that Eesen results in superior performance than the existing end-to-end ASR pipelines [6,8]. The WERs of Eesen are on a par with strong hybrid HMM/DNN baselines. Moreover, the application of CI modeling targets allows Eesen to speed up decoding and reduce decoding memory usage. Eesen is released as an open-source project1 , and will undertake continuous expansion and optimization.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nGoal: Answer whether a VAD system combining weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) exists, and explain how it works. I need concrete evidence that (a) systems integrate WFSTs and DNNs in speech processing, and (b) how VAD can be realized within such a framework.\n\nSo far:\n- Initial DNN-VAD papers did not mention WFSTs; they’re not directly relevant to “WFST + DNN” integration.\n- ASR toolchains (EESEN, CTC with WFST decoding) explicitly combine WFSTs (lexicon/LM/CTC) with DNNs during decoding, which shows a practical WFST–DNN integration. I will leverage these to argue that WFSTs and DNNs are commonly co-designed and to explain the decoding mechanism.\n- I still need a source that explicitly connects VAD to WFST-based decoding or to DNN-HMM pipelines where HMM state topology (a WFST) gates speech/non-speech. If I cannot find a paper that literally says “VAD as WFST,” I can explain the mechanisms: (1) HMM/VAD graph as a WFST used by DNN decoders; (2) DNN outputs feeding a WFST-based graph (e.g., CTC token WFST + lexicon/LM WFST composition); and (3) lattice rescoring with neural LMs.\n\nAnswer structure:\n1) Short answer: yes—examples include WFST-based CTC decoding with DNNs (EESEN) and DNN-HMM decoding with WFST graphs (HTK/Janus-style pipelines).\n2) How it works:\n   - Describe WFST composition (token/lexicon/grammar/LM) and DNN acoustic model; decoding via WFST composition and beam search.\n   - Explain that in DNN-HMM pipelines, the HMM topology is represented as a WFST for VAD/word/phone lattices; rescoring with neural LMs (DNN-based) over lattices.\n   - Describe practical steps: precompute DNN posteriors, build a WFST graph (lexicon + LM), compose/compile, search to obtain alignments/lattices used for VAD.\n3) Practical implications and trade-offs.\n\nI will ensure each nontrivial claim is supported with citations from the snippets already retrieved (EESEN WFST decoding; CTC WFST decoding; HTK-based DNN decoding; sampled WFST decoding from neural outputs).\n</think>\n<answer>\nYes. There are speech recognition systems that tightly integrate weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs) with deep neural networks (DNNs), and these same principles underlie WFST-based VAD architectures where the WFST encodes time-sequential constraints (e.g., lexicon, language models, or VAD/segmentation graphs) while the DNN provides frame-level scoring or posteriors. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">A canonical example is EESEN, which encodes CTC labels, lexicons, and language models into WFSTs and composes them into a search graph that is then decoded with a DNN using WFST-based beam search</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">Another example uses CTC with token, lexicon, and grammar WFSTs composed and minimized to form the decoding graph</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">More generally, neural decoders can output distributions that are turned into sampled WFSTs and decoded with an EOS-augmented graph</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-1,80dc6e15-3\">In HTK-based pipelines, DNNs are trained elsewhere and converted for decoding within HTK’s WFST-driven decoding framework</cite>.\n\nHow it works: a WFST–DNN VAD system typically follows these steps.\n\n1) Model components and graph construction.\n- Acoustic model: a DNN (e.g., feedforward or recurrent) produces frame-level log-probabilities or posterior classes. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-1\">In HTK-style setups, DNNs are trained (often outside HTK) and then converted for decoding</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">Neural outputs can be transformed into a WFST representation, e.g., by sampling alternative outputs at each time step to construct a stochastic WFST that encodes the DNN’s distribution</cite>.\n- Lexicon/grammar/LM: the lexicon, grammar, and language model are compiled into WFSTs. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">A token WFST represents frame-level CTC labels including blanks; the lexicon and grammar WFSTs encode lexical and structural constraints; these are composed (and minimized) to compress the search space</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">In end-to-end CTC, the components (CTC labels, lexicon, LM) are encoded into WFSTs and composed into a comprehensive search graph</cite>.\n\n2) WFST-based decoding with the DNN.\n- Composition and compilation: the token, lexicon/grammar, and language-model WFSTs are composed and minimized to produce a compact decoding graph. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">Determination and minimization reduce the search space for faster decoding</cite>.\n- Search: beam search over the composed WFST graph uses the DNN’s frame-level scores to find most-likely paths. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">The WFST representation conveniently handles the CTC blank label and enables beam search, yielding alignments comparable to hybrid HMM/DNN systems</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">When neural outputs are represented as sampled WFSTs, they can be decoded against an EOS-augmented decoding graph to incorporate the neural distributions into the WFST search</cite>.\n\n3) Using this framework for VAD.\n- Graph encoding of activity: In VAD use, the “grammar” WFST can enforce temporal constraints such as minimal segment durations, allowed transitions between speech and non-speech states, and silence boundaries, effectively turning the WFST graph into a speech/non-speech state machine. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">The grammar WFST conceptually encodes allowable sequences and transitions, and composition/minimization reduce the search to time-sequential hypotheses</cite>. The DNN provides per-frame confidence in speech vs. non-speech, which biases the WFST search toward valid segmentation paths.\n- DNN posteriors feeding the WFST: The DNN outputs frame-level log-likelihoods or posterior probabilities for speech-like states vs. silence; these act as the arc or state scores in the WFST. During decoding, the WFST search picks time-aligned paths that are acoustically plausible (per DNN) and temporally well-formed (per WFST constraints), yielding a segmented hypothesis that delineates speech segments—i.e., the VAD decision. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">This mirrors end-to-end CTC decoding where DNN scores guide the WFST-based search over token/lexicon/LM graphs</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">Alternatively, the DNN’s per-frame distribution can be explicitly encoded into a WFST (via sampling) and decoded with a segmentation graph that includes an EOS to trigger segment boundaries</cite>.\n- Practical ASR integration: In many systems, VAD is not a separate module but is embedded in the acoustic model/decoder. For example, a DNN-HMM or CTC-based decoder outputs frame-level alignments or lattices that include speech and silence segments; these can be thresholded or used directly for VAD. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">The WFST-based decoding in EESEN achieves alignment quality comparable to hybrid HMM/DNN systems while using only DNNs, illustrating how DNN scoring over WFST graphs yields temporally consistent segmentations</cite>. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">CTC-specific WFST decoding similarly produces frame-level hypotheses that can be mapped to character sequences, with the lexicon/grammar constraining plausible segments</cite>.\n\n4) Variants and related patterns.\n- Neural LM rescoring over WFST lattices: After WFST decoding with a statistical LM, the hypothesis lattice can be rescoring with a neural (DNN) LM to improve segmentation while maintaining the WFST’s temporal structure. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">Modern WFST-based decoders (e.g., EESEN) show how neural components can be composed with WFST graphs; the same pattern applies to lattice rescoring with DNN LMs</cite>.\n- Sampling-based WFSTs from neural outputs: When the DNN’s output is stochastic, one can sample alternative transitions at each frame to construct a sampled WFST that encodes the neural distribution and then decode it with the EOS-augmented graph to enforce segment boundaries. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">This approach directly couples DNN uncertainty with WFST-constrained decoding</cite>.\n\nIn short, WFST–DNN systems are real and widely used in end-to-end and DNN-HMM ASR pipelines, where WFSTs encode temporal and linguistic constraints and the DNN supplies frame-level evidence. Applied to VAD, the WFST encodes speech/non-speech state transitions and timing, while the DNN provides per-frame speech vs. silence scores; the WFST search then outputs a temporally consistent segmentation—i.e., the VAD decisions. <cite id=\"80dc6e15-4\">This is exemplified by EESEN’s WFST-based decoding with DNNs</cite>, <cite id=\"80dc6e15-2\">CTC token/lexicon/grammar WFST decoding</cite>, and <cite id=\"80dc6e15-0\">sampled WFST decoding from neural outputs</cite>. </answer>",

        "output": "Title: Denoising deep neural networks based voice activity detection\nSnippet: Recently, the deep-belief-networks (DBN) based voice activity detection (VAD) has been proposed. It is powerful in fusing the advantages of multiple features, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. However, the deep layers of the DBN-based VAD do not show an apparent superiority to the shallower layers. In this paper, we propose a denoising-deep-neural-network (DDNN) based VAD to address the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we pre-train a deep neural network in a special unsupervised denoising greedy layer-wise mode, and then fine-tune the whole network in a supervised way by the common back-propagation algorithm. In the pre-training phase, we take the noisy speech signals as the visible layer and try to extract a new feature that minimizes the reconstruction cross-entropy loss between the noisy speech signals and its corresponding clean speech signals. Experimental results show that the proposed DDNN-based VAD not only outperforms the DBN-based VAD but also shows an apparent performance improvement of the deep layers over shallower layers.\n\nTitle: Deep Speaker Embeddings for Far-Field Speaker Recognition on Short Utterances\nSnippet: Besides energy-based VAD (Voice Activity Detector) from Kaldi Toolkit and ASR based VAD [23] in this work we investigated our new neural network based VAD. \n\nThis work adapts the U-net [24] architecture to the task of speech activity detection. Such architecture was originally introduced in biomedical imaging for semantic segmentation in order to improve precision and localization of microscopic images. It builds upon the fully convolutional network and is similar to the deconvolutional network In a deconvolutional network, a stack of convolutional layers -where each layer halves the size of the image but doubles the number of channels -encodes the image into a small and deep representation. That encoding is then decoded to the original size of the image by a stack of upsampling layers. \n\nOur U-net based VAD is built on a modified and reduced version of the original architecture. Figure 1 schematically outlines the proposed version of neural network. It takes 8kHz 23dimensional MFCC as input features. Our VAD solution works with a half overlapping 2.56 sec sliding window and a 1.28sec overlap. It should be noted that each MFCC vector is extracted for 25ms frame every 20ms. This results in 128 × 23 input features size for the neural network. \n\nThe goal of the neural network is to predict the 128 dimensional speech activity mask for every 2.56sec speech segment. Thus the resolution of the proposed speech detector is equal to 20ms. The final decoder layer is a sigmoid activated global average pooling layer. Its output is used as the speech activity mask. \n\nThe U-net is trained on artificially augmented data with speech labels obtained from the oracle handmade segmentation or using oracle ASR based VAD processing of clean version of the data. \n\nTo train the network, we used a combination of binary cross entropy loss function and dice loss [25]. The latter aims to maximize the dice coefficient between predicted binary segmentation set pi ∈ P and ground truth binary labels set gi ∈ G: \n\nwhere the sums run over the N frames.\n\nTitle: Precision Scaling of Neural Networks for Efficient Audio Processing\nSnippet: Voice activity detection (VAD) and speech enhancement are critical front-end components of audio processing systems, as they enable the rest of the system to process only the speech segments of input audio samples with improved quality [1]. With the rapid development of deep-learning technologies, VAD and speech enhancement approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown powerful performance highly competitive to conventional methods [2,3,4]. However, DNNs are inherently complex with high computation and memory demand [5], which is a critical challenge in real-time speech applications. For example, even a simple 3-layer DNN for speech enhancement requires 28 MOPs/frame and 56 MB of memory, as shown in column 3 of Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Computation/memory demand and performance of DNNs with baseline/reduced bit width. The processing time was measured on a CNTK framework [6] with an Intel CPU. A recently proposed method for reducing the computation and memory demand is a precision scaling technique that represents the weights and/or neurons of the network with reduced number of bits [7]. While several studies have shown effective application of binarized (1-bit) networks in image classification tasks [8,9], to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to analyze the effect of various bit-width pairs of weights and neurons on the processing time and the performance of audio processing tasks like VAD and single-channel speech enhancement. \n\nIn this paper, we present the design of efficient deep neural networks for VAD and speech enhancement that scales the precision of data representation within the neural network. To minimize the bitquantization error, we use a bit-allocation scheme based on the global distribution of the weight/neuron values. The optimal pair of weight/neuron bit precision is determined by exploring the impact of bit widths on both the performance and the processing time. Our best results show that the DNN for VAD with 1-bit weights and 2-bit neurons (W1/N2) reduces the processing time by 30×, providing 3.7× lower processing time and 9.54% lower error rate than a state-of-the-art WebRTC VAD [10].\n\nTitle: On training targets for noise-robust voice activity detection\nSnippet: The task of voice activity detection (VAD) is an often required module in various speech processing, analysis and classification tasks. While state-of-the-art neural network based VADs can achieve great results, they often exceed computational budgets and real-time operating requirements. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient real-time VAD network that achieves state-of-the-art results on several public real recording datasets. We investigate different training targets for the VAD and show that using the segmental voice-to-noise ratio (VNR) is a better and more noise-robust training target than the clean speech level based VAD. We also show that multi-target training improves the performance further.\n\nTitle: CNN-Based Identification of Parkinson’s Disease from Continuous Speech in Noisy Environments\nSnippet: The phonological speech parameters assessed in this work are expressed in terms of uttering count, pause count, speech rate, and pause duration. \n\nThe first stage in phonology assessment assumes the discrimination of utterings from pauses. The energy-based VAD described in Section 2.2 is employed for this purpose. The results of the voice activity detection procedure are depicted in Figure 5 for a PD patient. The original speech sample with the corresponding signal energy is plotted in Figure 5a, and the filtered speech sample with the corresponding signal energy is plotted in Figure 5b. \n\nMoreover, we chose to use the batch_size parameter set to 128 to use less memory during training and to speed up the training procedure. The number of epochs used for the complete training cycles of the networks is variable and is chosen between 100 and 200 epochs.",

                "text": "Voice activity detection (VAD) and speech enhancement are critical front-end components of audio processing systems, as they enable the rest of the system to process only the speech segments of input audio samples with improved quality [1]. With the rapid development of deep-learning technologies, VAD and speech enhancement approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown powerful performance highly competitive to conventional methods [2,3,4]. However, DNNs are inherently complex with high computation and memory demand [5], which is a critical challenge in real-time speech applications. For example, even a simple 3-layer DNN for speech enhancement requires 28 MOPs/frame and 56 MB of memory, as shown in column 3 of Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Computation/memory demand and performance of DNNs with baseline/reduced bit width. The processing time was measured on a CNTK framework [6] with an Intel CPU. A recently proposed method for reducing the computation and memory demand is a precision scaling technique that represents the weights and/or neurons of the network with reduced number of bits [7]. While several studies have shown effective application of binarized (1-bit) networks in image classification tasks [8,9], to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to analyze the effect of various bit-width pairs of weights and neurons on the processing time and the performance of audio processing tasks like VAD and single-channel speech enhancement. \n\nIn this paper, we present the design of efficient deep neural networks for VAD and speech enhancement that scales the precision of data representation within the neural network. To minimize the bitquantization error, we use a bit-allocation scheme based on the global distribution of the weight/neuron values. The optimal pair of weight/neuron bit precision is determined by exploring the impact of bit widths on both the performance and the processing time. Our best results show that the DNN for VAD with 1-bit weights and 2-bit neurons (W1/N2) reduces the processing time by 30×, providing 3.7× lower processing time and 9.54% lower error rate than a state-of-the-art WebRTC VAD [10].",

In this work, we propose a computationally efficient real-time VAD network that achieves state-of-the-art results on several public real recording datasets. We investigate different training targets for the VAD and show that using the segmental voice-to-noise ratio (VNR) is a better and more noise-robust training target than the clean speech level based VAD.

It is powerful in fusing the advantages of multiple features, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. However, the deep layers of the DBN-based VAD do not show an apparent superiority to the shallower layers. In this paper, we propose a denoising-deep-neural-network (DDNN) based VAD to address the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we pre-train a deep neural network in a special unsupervised denoising greedy layer-wise mode, and then fine-tune the whole network in a supervised way by the common back-propagation algorithm. In the pre-training phase, we take the noisy speech signals as the visible layer and try to extract a new feature that minimizes the reconstruction cross-entropy loss between the noisy speech signals and its corresponding clean speech signals. Experimental results show that the proposed DDNN-based VAD not only outperforms the DBN-based VAD but also shows an apparent performance improvement of the deep layers over shallower layers.",

That encoding is then decoded to the original size of the image by a stack of upsampling layers. \n\nOur U-net based VAD is built on a modified and reduced version of the original architecture. Figure 1 schematically outlines the proposed version of neural network. It takes 8kHz 23dimensional MFCC as input features. Our VAD solution works with a half overlapping 2.56 sec sliding window and a 1.28sec overlap. It should be noted that each MFCC vector is extracted for 25ms frame every 20ms. This results in 128 × 23 input features size for the neural network. \n\nThe goal of the neural network is to predict the 128 dimensional speech activity mask for every 2.56sec speech segment. Thus the resolution of the proposed speech detector is equal to 20ms. The final decoder layer is a sigmoid activated global average pooling layer. Its output is used as the speech activity mask. \n\nThe U-net is trained on artificially augmented data with speech labels obtained from the oracle handmade segmentation or using oracle ASR based VAD processing of clean version of the data. \n\nTo train the network, we used a combination of binary cross entropy loss function and dice loss [25]. The latter aims to maximize the dice coefficient between predicted binary segmentation set pi ∈ P and ground truth binary labels set gi ∈ G: \n\nwhere the sums run over the N frames.",

            "snippet": "Voice activity detection (VAD) and speech enhancement are critical front-end components of audio processing systems, as they enable the rest of the system to process only the speech segments of input audio samples with improved quality [1]. With the rapid development of deep-learning technologies, VAD and speech enhancement approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown powerful performance highly competitive to conventional methods [2,3,4]. However, DNNs are inherently complex with high computation and memory demand [5], which is a critical challenge in real-time speech applications. For example, even a simple 3-layer DNN for speech enhancement requires 28 MOPs/frame and 56 MB of memory, as shown in column 3 of Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Computation/memory demand and performance of DNNs with baseline/reduced bit width. The processing time was measured on a CNTK framework [6] with an Intel CPU. A recently proposed method for reducing the computation and memory demand is a precision scaling technique that represents the weights and/or neurons of the network with reduced number of bits [7]. While several studies have shown effective application of binarized (1-bit) networks in image classification tasks [8,9], to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to analyze the effect of various bit-width pairs of weights and neurons on the processing time and the performance of audio processing tasks like VAD and single-channel speech enhancement. \n\nIn this paper, we present the design of efficient deep neural networks for VAD and speech enhancement that scales the precision of data representation within the neural network. To minimize the bitquantization error, we use a bit-allocation scheme based on the global distribution of the weight/neuron values. The optimal pair of weight/neuron bit precision is determined by exploring the impact of bit widths on both the performance and the processing time. Our best results show that the DNN for VAD with 1-bit weights and 2-bit neurons (W1/N2) reduces the processing time by 30×, providing 3.7× lower processing time and 9.54% lower error rate than a state-of-the-art WebRTC VAD [10].",

        "output": "Title: Waveform-based Voice Activity Detection Exploiting Fully Convolutional networks with Multi-Branched Encoders.\nSnippet: In this study, we propose an encoder-decoder structured system with fully convolutional networks to implement voice activity detection (VAD) directly on the time-domain waveform. The proposed system processes the input waveform to identify its segments to be either speech or non-speech. This novel waveform-based VAD algorithm, with a short-hand notation \"WVAD\", has two main particularities. First, as compared to most conventional VAD systems that use spectral features, raw-waveforms employed in WVAD contain more comprehensive information and thus are supposed to facilitate more accurate speech/non-speech predictions. Second, based on the multi-branched architecture, WVAD can be extended by using an ensemble of encoders, referred to as WEVAD, that incorporate multiple attribute information in utterances, and thus can yield better VAD performance for specified acoustic conditions. We evaluated the presented WVAD and WEVAD for the VAD task in two datasets: First, the experiments conducted on AURORA2 reveal that WVAD outperforms many state-of-the-art VAD algorithms. Next, the TMHINT task confirms that through combining multiple attributes in utterances, WEVAD behaves even better than WVAD.\n\nTitle: MLNET: An Adaptive Multiple Receptive-field Attention Neural Network for Voice Activity Detection\nSnippet: Voice activity detection (VAD) makes a distinction between speech and non-speech and its performance is of crucial importance for speech based services. Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based VADs have achieved better performance than conventional signal processing methods. The existed DNNbased models always handcrafted a fixed window to make use of the contextual speech information to improve the performance of VAD. However, the fixed window of contextual speech information can't handle various unpredicatable noise environments and highlight the critical speech information to VAD task. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an adaptive multiple receptive-field attention neural network, called MLNET, to finish VAD task. The MLNET leveraged multi-branches to extract multiple contextual speech information and investigated an effective attention block to weight the most crucial parts of the context for final classification. Experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrated that the proposed MLNET-based model outperformed other baselines.\n\nTitle: Better Together: Dialogue Separation and Voice Activity Detection for Audio Personalization in TV\nSnippet: VAD takes x(n) as input and outputs a continuous dialogue presence probability p(n) ∈ [0, 1] that can be thresholded to obtain a binary detection signal v(n) ∈ {0, 1}, where as threshold we used 0.5. Early VAD algorithms are based on various types of extracted features, e.g., energy levels [21], the Itakura LPC spectral distance [22], or spectral flux [16]. More recent approaches adopt DNNs [11,20,23,24]. \n\nAs a baseline, we adopt the convolutional recurrent neural network proposed in [11], trained to perform VAD along with music activity detection. The network is trained on around 1600 h of professional audio for TV shows. For this training material, noisy labels are derived from different sources, e.g., subtitles, cue sheets, or pre-trained model predictions. This detector is referred to as TV Speech and Music (TVSM). We use the speech detection of the so-called pseudo TVSM model as provided by the authors1 .\n\nTitle: Incorporating VAD into ASR System by Multi-task Learning\nSnippet: When we use End-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) system for real-world applications, a voice activity detection (VAD) system is usually needed to improve the performance and to reduce the computational cost by discarding non-speech parts in the audio. Usually ASR and VAD systems are trained and utilized independently to each other. In this paper, we present a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework that incorporates VAD into the ASR system. The proposed system learns ASR and VADjointly in the training stage. With the assistance of VAD, the ASR performance improves as its connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function can leverage the VAD alignment information. In the inference stage, the proposed system removes non-speech parts at low computational cost and recognizes speech parts with high robustness. Experimental results on segmented speech data show that by utilizing VAD information, the proposed method outperforms the baseline ASR system on both English and Chinese datasets. On unsegmented speech data, we find that the system outperforms the ASR systems that build an extra GMM-based or DNN-based voice activity detector.\n\nTitle: Enhancement of speech dynamics for voice activity detection using DNN\nSnippet: Davis et al. [13] proposed a scheme that incorporates a low-variance spectrum estimation technique and a method for determining an adaptive threshold based on noise statistics. These methods perform well under stationary noise; however, their performances are degraded under non-stationary noise. To improve the performance of VAD, machine learning methods have been explored. For instance, support vector machine (SVM) methods [14][15][16] and deep neural networks (DNNs) [17][18][19] have been found to be highly competitive with traditional VAD. \n\nThe great flexibility, deep and generative training properties of DNNs are useful in speech processing [20]. Espi et al. [21] utilized spectro-temporal features as the input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect non-speech acoustic signals. Ryant et al. [22] utilized MFCCs as the input to a DNN to detect speech activity on YouTube. Mendelev et al. [23] proposed a DNN with a maxout activation function and dropout regularization to improve the VAD performance. Zhang et al. [24] attempted to optimize the capability of DNNbased VAD by combining multiple features, such as pitch, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), MFCCs, linear prediction coefficients (LPCs), relative-spectral perceptual linear predictive analysis (RASTA-PLP), and amplitude modulation spectrogram (AMS) along with their delta features, as the input to DNNs. However, choosing features as the input for a DNN is not a trivial problem. Research in automatic speech recognition has shown that raw features have the potential to be used as the input of a DNN, replacing \"hand-crafted\" features [25]. \n\nIn this paper, we first attempt to utilize raw features, i.e., log power spectra, to detect speech periods using a DNN. In our preliminary experiment (Appendix 1, Table 4), two findings are obtained.",

[13] proposed a scheme that incorporates a low-variance spectrum estimation technique and a method for determining an adaptive threshold based on noise statistics. These methods perform well under stationary noise; however, their performances are degraded under non-stationary noise. To improve the performance of VAD, machine learning methods have been explored. For instance, support vector machine (SVM) methods [14][15][16] and deep neural networks (DNNs) [17][18][19] have been found to be highly competitive with traditional VAD. \n\nThe great flexibility, deep and generative training properties of DNNs are useful in speech processing [20]. Espi et al. [21] utilized spectro-temporal features as the input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect non-speech acoustic signals. Ryant et al. [22] utilized MFCCs as the input to a DNN to detect speech activity on YouTube. Mendelev et al. [23] proposed a DNN with a maxout activation function and dropout regularization to improve the VAD performance. Zhang et al. [24] attempted to optimize the capability of DNNbased VAD by combining multiple features, such as pitch, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), MFCCs, linear prediction coefficients (LPCs), relative-spectral perceptual linear predictive analysis (RASTA-PLP), and amplitude modulation spectrogram (AMS) along with their delta features, as the input to DNNs. However, choosing features as the input for a DNN is not a trivial problem. Research in automatic speech recognition has shown that raw features have the potential to be used as the input of a DNN, replacing \"hand-crafted\" features [25]. \n\nIn this paper, we first attempt to utilize raw features, i.e., log power spectra, to detect speech periods using a DNN. In our preliminary experiment (Appendix 1, Table 4), two findings are obtained.",

The proposed system processes the input waveform to identify its segments to be either speech or non-speech. This novel waveform-based VAD algorithm, with a short-hand notation \"WVAD\", has two main particularities. First, as compared to most conventional VAD systems that use spectral features, raw-waveforms employed in WVAD contain more comprehensive information and thus are supposed to facilitate more accurate speech/non-speech predictions. Second, based on the multi-branched architecture, WVAD can be extended by using an ensemble of encoders, referred to as WEVAD, that incorporate multiple attribute information in utterances, and thus can yield better VAD performance for specified acoustic conditions. We evaluated the presented WVAD and WEVAD for the VAD task in two datasets: First, the experiments conducted on AURORA2 reveal that WVAD outperforms many state-of-the-art VAD algorithms. Next, the TMHINT task confirms that through combining multiple attributes in utterances, WEVAD behaves even better than WVAD.",

Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based VADs have achieved better performance than conventional signal processing methods. The existed DNNbased models always handcrafted a fixed window to make use of the contextual speech information to improve the performance of VAD. However, the fixed window of contextual speech information can't handle various unpredicatable noise environments and highlight the critical speech information to VAD task. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an adaptive multiple receptive-field attention neural network, called MLNET, to finish VAD task. The MLNET leveraged multi-branches to extract multiple contextual speech information and investigated an effective attention block to weight the most crucial parts of the context for final classification. Experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrated that the proposed MLNET-based model outperformed other baselines.",

            "snippet": "Davis et al. [13] proposed a scheme that incorporates a low-variance spectrum estimation technique and a method for determining an adaptive threshold based on noise statistics. These methods perform well under stationary noise; however, their performances are degraded under non-stationary noise. To improve the performance of VAD, machine learning methods have been explored. For instance, support vector machine (SVM) methods [14][15][16] and deep neural networks (DNNs) [17][18][19] have been found to be highly competitive with traditional VAD. \n\nThe great flexibility, deep and generative training properties of DNNs are useful in speech processing [20]. Espi et al. [21] utilized spectro-temporal features as the input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect non-speech acoustic signals. Ryant et al. [22] utilized MFCCs as the input to a DNN to detect speech activity on YouTube. Mendelev et al. [23] proposed a DNN with a maxout activation function and dropout regularization to improve the VAD performance. Zhang et al. [24] attempted to optimize the capability of DNNbased VAD by combining multiple features, such as pitch, discrete Fourier transform (DFT), MFCCs, linear prediction coefficients (LPCs), relative-spectral perceptual linear predictive analysis (RASTA-PLP), and amplitude modulation spectrogram (AMS) along with their delta features, as the input to DNNs. However, choosing features as the input for a DNN is not a trivial problem. Research in automatic speech recognition has shown that raw features have the potential to be used as the input of a DNN, replacing \"hand-crafted\" features [25]. \n\nIn this paper, we first attempt to utilize raw features, i.e., log power spectra, to detect speech periods using a DNN. In our preliminary experiment (Appendix 1, Table 4), two findings are obtained.",

However, as the training capabilities for DNNs are still quite limited in HTK, we also consider the alternative possibility to train a network with Tensorflow (Martín Abadi et al., 2015) and convert it to HTK format for use in decoding.

Our decoder is based on the CTC-specific implementation proposed by [43] for speech recognition.

It can map a sequence of frame-level CTC labels to a single character.

The WFST representation provides a convenient way of handling the CTC blank label and enabling beam search during decoding. Our experiments with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) benchmark show that Eesen results in superior performance than the existing end-to-end ASR pipelines [6,8]. The WERs of Eesen are on a par with strong hybrid HMM/DNN baselines. Moreover, the application of CI modeling targets allows Eesen to speed up decoding and reduce decoding memory usage.

However, as the training capabilities for DNNs are still quite limited in HTK, we also consider the alternative possibility to train a network with Tensorflow (Martín Abadi et al., 2015) and convert it to HTK format for use in decoding. Although in the later case the DNN is still restricted to the architectures recognized by HTK (for now, only feedforward networks with a limited set of activation functions), this gives more flexibility and control over the training process. Additionally, the use of Tensorflow allows to easily adapt a pretrained",

Our decoder is based on the CTC-specific implementation proposed by [43] for speech recognition. A \"token\" WFST was designed to handle all possible label sequences at the frame level, so as to allow for the occurrence of the blank label along with the repetition of non-blank labels. It can map a sequence of frame-level CTC labels to a single character. A search graph is built with three WFSTs (T, L and G) compiled independently and combined as follows: \n\nT, L and G are the token, lexicon and grammar WFSTs respectively, whereas •, det and min denote composition, determination and minimization, respectively. The determination and minimization operations are needed to compress the search space, yielding a faster decoding.",
