iterate with teacher review.  \n- Examples:  \n  - Uruguay (Primary): Digileac platform generated personalized texts, illustrations, and exercises for Social Sciences (History) in 4th–6th grade; pupils showed varied engagement and time-on-task, with two-thirds enjoying the AI-modified materials.<cite id=\"bba4d159-0\">GenAI personalized materials per pupil knowledge and interest; two out of three pupils enjoyed the modified materials</cite>  \n  - Design pattern: Combine student profiles or formative data with prompt templates to constrain outputs to standards and grade-level targets.<cite id=\"bba4d159-0\">The process described includes creating lessons, materials, and assessments tailored to pupils’ knowledge and interests</cite>\n\n2) Formative Feedback and Assessment  \n- Approach: Deploy GenAI to provide rubric-aligned, iterative feedback on drafts; integrate into writing cycles and peer-review routines.  \n- Examples:  \n  - United States (Middle/High School): CyberScholar provided detailed, rubric-aligned feedback across ELA and social studies; students reported improved guidance and teachers shifted to guiding AI feedback processes and structuring iterative revisions.<cite id=\"51be36a6-1\">Students perceived detailed feedback, enhanced interactivity, and alignment with rubric criteria; teachers moved to guiding AI feedback loops</cite><cite id=\"51be36a6-4\">Participants emphasized support rather than replacement of teacher feedback and called for iterative revision designs</cite>  \n  - Practice: Use structured prompts for specific feedback types (e.g., thesis clarity, evidence use) and have students revise multiple times with AI as a “coach.”<cite id=\"51be36a6-1\">The tool’s feedback was integrated with teachers’ rubrics and content, supporting dialogic revision</cite>\n\n3) Language Learning and Literacy Support  \n- Approach: Use GenAI for brainstorming, sentence-level revision, paraphrasing, vocabulary building, and strategy suggestions; blend with teacher formative assessment.  \n- Examples:  \n  - China (Pre-service teacher studies; informative of K–12 patterns): Human–computer cooperative feedback outperformed either teacher or AI alone on Chinese writing feedback, supporting preservice training and improved student writing quality.<cite id=\"51be36a6-3\">Cooperative human–AI feedback was significantly better than either alone across all aspects</cite>  \n  - Considerations: Balance efficiency with human connection; ensure socio-emotional learning remains a teacher-led domain.<cite id=\"51be36a6-2\">GenAI feedback can save time and be specific, but cannot replace human interactions that foster socio-emotional skills</cite>\n\n4) Creativity, Reflection, and Inquiry  \n- Approach: Facilitate creative writing, story ideation, reflective journaling, and exploratory questions, using GenAI to scaffold ideation and metacognition.  \n- Examples:  \n  - Cross-national usage patterns: GenAI is used for creative support, reflective writing, and structured feedback in K–12, extending beyond rote academic tasks.<cite id=\"bba4d159-1\">Task-based categorization highlights creative and motivational support, reflective writing, and structured feedback as common GenAI uses</cite>  \n  - Classroom design: Use structured prompts and reflection rubrics to ensure GenAI outputs support deeper thinking and authenticity checks.<cite id=\"bba4d159-1\">Opportunities include enhancing creativity and reflective thinking, which are often underaddressed by conventional tools</cite>\n\n5) Teacher Support, Analytics, and Curriculum Design  \n- Approach: Use GenAI to prototype feedback cycles, generate sample assessments, and assist observational assessment;

Visionary educators recognize AI’s potential in the classroom. According to IBM, AI will not completely replace humans, but those who use AI will replace those who do not. This statement emphasizes the importance of integrating AI in K-12 education. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of AI tools and platforms for K-12 education, with the hope of serving as a practical reference for teachers to use these tools. This review discusses the definitions and types of AI for education. It further identifies and reviews currently available and popular AI tools and their applications in K-12 education. It offers quick references for teachers on how they can harness various AI tools for different teaching and learning purposes, along with addressing ethical concerns such as data privacy and algorithmic biases. This article classifies AI tools on the basis of instructional, administrative, and analytical usage to address diverse needs, enhance teaching and learning, provide personalized instruction, and predict student outcomes. This review also provides information for teachers to choose appropriate AI tools for specific purposes. The use of AI tools and associated concerns in the K-12 classrooms are also discussed, encouraging teachers to create more dynamic, inclusive, and effective learning environments while preparing students for the future. This article also offers future directions for researchers and product developers regarding the use of AI in K-12 education.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=c0bee8cc-1>\nTitle: Designing AI Learning Experiences for K-12: Emerging Works, Future Opportunities and a Design Framework\nSnippet: Touretzky et al. pioneered identifying what K-12 students should know about AI. In [54], they listed a variety of AI teaching and learning resources for K-12, presented five Big AI Ideas for young learners, and elaborated on them for four grade bands: K-2, 3-5. 6-8, and 9-12. Many recent works have used the Big AI Ideas to develop effective K-12 AI tools and curriculum [3,29,41,53]. \n\nDue to the nascency of the field, few literature reviews on AI/ML education for K-12 students exist. In one of the most recent reviews, Marques et al. conducted a systematic mapping with a focus on ML instructional units (IUs) in elementary to high schools. The researchers set their scope with respect to the IUs (\"a set of classes [...] designed to teach certain learning objectives to a specific target audience\"), presented the ML competencies currently taught in existing IUs, the application domains covered, the types of data utilized, and the types of instructional methods and materials used. They emphasized the importance of teaching young students about AI, how to implement the IUs as extracurricular units, a need for K-12 AI assessment, and the trade-off between creating transparent systems to provide more comprehensive information and simplifying or \"black-boxing\" underlying ML concepts to avoid cognitive overload. They also identified a lack of training for K-12 teachers to implement the IUs in their classrooms. Nonetheless, the authors also mentioned how existing IUs not published in scientific articles (e.g., tools developed by those outside the research community) were not evaluated. Furthermore, they only analyzed ML IUs, rather than AI curricula in general. \n\nAnother study, [30], analyzed curricula with a broader focus on AI. The objective of the study was to create an AI Literacy framework for developing tools and curricula for a general, nontechnical audience, including learners outside of K-12 [30]. The authors thematically derived a list of AI competencies and design considerations from existing research and AI learning resources and proposed a conceptual framework to guide HCI researchers' in developing AI curricula.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=c0bee8cc-2>\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence Applications in K-12 Education: A Systematic Literature Review\nSnippet: In this systematic review, the integration of AI and k-12 education is being investigated in terms of the application of the proposed systems, the role and type of AI, and targeted course and level. According to the questions of this study, the inclusion criteria were obtained to define which studies should be included in the review.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=c0bee8cc-3>\nTitle: Designing AI Learning Experiences for K-12: Emerging Works, Future Opportunities and a Design Framework\nSnippet: Furthermore, we explored specifically how design considerations may differ in K-12 learning contexts and where there are gaps in the literature. \n\nWe conducted an exploratory review of AI for K-12 education (AI4K12) literature and tools in order to distill a design framework to inform development of AI learning experiences for K-12. We examined work that falls under AI education and AI literacy, but narrowed our search within a K-12 learning grade band, though we occasionally drew inspiration from adjacent work in other fields or higher learning grade bands (i.e., general computer science education and university-level education). We then organized key design elements in a conceptual framework that we thematically derived from the literature. \n\nThe main contributions of this paper are: \n\n(1) An analysis of how existing work applies general AI literacy competencies and design considerations; (2) A design framework for designers and researchers creating K-12 AI education tools; \n\n(3) A reference chart for educators selecting AI educational tools to suit the needs of their classrooms. \n\nAs K-12 AI education continues to grow and evolve, we expect this analysis and framework to be further refined as well. We present this paper as a stepping stone for other designers and researchers to create better AI educational experiences for K-12 learners, so that their students may also become the designers and researchers of AI education in the future.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=c0bee8cc-4>\nTitle: Pedagogical incorporation of artificial intelligence in K-12 science education: A decadal bibliometric mapping and systematic literature review (2013-2023)\nSnippet: While offering valuable insights, their study's focus on trends and research foci underscores the need for a more comprehensive review that explicitly addresses the pedagogical incorporation of AI within K-12 science classrooms. \n\nIn conclusion, existing systematic reviews on AISE often overlook recent advancements and have narrow scopes, while some lack a comprehensive analysis of AI's pedagogical implications in K-12 science education. Addressing these gaps is essential for thoroughly understanding AI's role in science education, thereby building on the findings from this review; a conceptual framework (Figure 1) was developed, guided by the research questions outlined in this study, to systematically address the identified gaps and provide a foundation for further investigation. This framework is informed by constructivist and social constructivist theories, focusing on six key dimensions: Leading Journals, Influential Papers, Authors, and Country contributions, which offer insight into the principal sources and contributors in the field; AI Technologies, which examines the specific AI technologies utilized in K-12 science classrooms; Educational Grade Levels, which explores the variation in AI integration across different educational stages; Research Methodologies, which reviews the approaches used to study AI's impact; Pedagogical Approaches, which considers various strategies for integrating AI with classroom teaching practices; and Impact on Learning Outcomes, which evaluates the effects of AI on student performance and engagement. By synthesizing these dimensions, the framework facilitates a thorough understanding of AI's role in science education, highlights areas needing further research, and guides the study's exploration of AI's integration and pedagogical implications. Subsequently, a bibliometric mapping and a systematic literature review [SLR] of empirical studies on AI's integration in K-12 science education from 2013 to 2023 were conducted using the PRISMA framework, further refining the scope and focus of the research.\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nSynthesis of first query:\n- The initial snippets provide high-level frameworks for AI in K-12: categorizations (instructional, administrative, analytical), design frameworks for AI learning experiences, and a science-education conceptual framework.

They expressed a willingness to cooperate with generative AI, even offering insights on how to effectively cooperate with AI to provide writing feedback. First, the 11 pre-service teachers were asked to think critically about the role of generative AI in providing writing feedback, both in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. The pre-service teachers were more likely to recognize the advantages, as opposed to the disadvantages, of generative AI for providing writing feedback, including saving time, reducing their workload, and providing specific suggestions. It must be acknowledged that generative AI has become an unstoppable force that is now widely used (M. Zhu et al., 2020). The perceptions of pre-service teachers were in line with the development trend of AI (Wambsganss et al., 2022). Additionally, all 11 pre-service teachers indicated their willingness to cooperate with generative AI in providing writing feedback, recognizing that it could complement their strengths and make the provided writing feedback more effective, comprehensive, personalized, and emotional. This further demonstrates the effectiveness and universality of the theory of human-machine collaboration (Wang, 2019). Finally, the pre-service teachers discussed the dynamics of cooperating with generative AI, stating that teachers should remain the authority and generative AI should be used as a tool to provide writing feedback. This helps to clarify the cooperative relationship when using generative AI to provide writing feedback. Based on the theory of human-machine collaboration and the interviews of 11 pre-service teachers, this study suggests adopting a teacher-led approach, with AI used as an auxiliary tool to provide writing feedback.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=51be36a6-1>\nTitle: Generative AI in K-12 Education: The CyberScholar Initiative\nSnippet: This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI assistant tool that aims to provide formative feedback on writing in K-12 contexts. Specifically, this study explores how students worked with CyberScholar in diverse subject areas, including English Language Arts, Social Studies, and Modern World History classes in Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the United States. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to support K-12 students'writing in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments. Data were collected through implementation observations, surveys, and interviews by participating 121 students and 4 teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed that the feedback tool was perceived as a valuable tool for supporting student writing through detailed feedback, enhanced interactivity, and alignment with rubric criteria. Students appreciated the tool's guidance in refining their writing. For the students, the assistant tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition. For the teaching side, the findings indicate a shift in teachers'roles, from serving primarily as evaluators to guiding AI feedback processes that foster better student writing and critical thinking.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=51be36a6-2>\nTitle: Exploring the Effectiveness of Cooperative Pre-Service Teacher and Generative AI Writing Feedback on Chinese Writing\nSnippet: With the rapid development of information technology, intelligent technology is gradually penetrating the field of education, providing infinite possibilities for innovative teaching methods. Among these methods, generative AI, with its powerful natural language processing ability, has changed the means of providing feedback in the teaching of writing and has become an increasingly efficient and user-friendly writing feedback tool (Wambsganss et al., 2022;M. Zhu et al., 2020). However, despite the many theoretical advantages of generative-AI-based feedback, there is a lack of in-depth research on the effectiveness of its practical application in the field of language writing for primary school students. Cultivating primary school students' writing skills is a critical objective in foundational education, profoundly shaping the students' development in verbal expression, logical thinking, and emotional articulation (Yao, 2013). In this process, teacher feedback plays a crucial role, not only helping students to identify and correct errors in their writing but also promoting the improvement of their writing skills and development of their thought processes (Bitchener & Storch, 2016;Cheng et al., 2021;Schuldt, 2019;Graham et al., Behav. Sci. 2025, 15, 518 2 of 22 2015). However, in practice, teacher feedback is often affected by a variety of factors, such as personal subjective factors, time, and energy, and it is difficult to ensure accurate and consistent feedback (L. Huang, 2009). In contrast, generative AI can provide more objective and accurate feedback through big data analysis and algorithmic optimization (Crompton & Burke, 2023). At the same time, generative AI can also quickly process a large amount of student work, saving teachers a lot of time and improving their work efficiency (Mizumoto & Eguchi, 2023). However, despite the advantages of generative AI feedback, there are still many controversies regarding its use as a complete replacement for teacher feedback. Firstly, the feedback from generative AI cannot completely replace human interactions and the role of teachers in developing social and emotional skills. Human interactions play a crucial role in building relationships, empathy, and collaborative learning, which AI may struggle to replicate (Haleem et al., 2022).\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=51be36a6-3>\nTitle: Exploring the Effectiveness of Cooperative Pre-Service Teacher and Generative AI Writing Feedback on Chinese Writing\nSnippet: Due to their efficiency, stability, and enhanced language comprehension and analysis capabilities, generative AIs have attracted increasing attention in the field of writing as higher-level automated writing evaluation (AWE) feedback tools. However, few studies have examined the impact of pre-service teachers using generative AI in combination with their own teaching experience to provide feedback on Chinese writing. To fill this gap, based on 1035 writing feedback texts, we examined the differences in writing feedback between 11 pre-service teachers and Erine Bot (a generative AI) and interviewed the pre-service teachers about their willingness to cooperate with generative AI. The collaborative writing feedback generated by the pre-service teachers using AI was compared with the feedback generated by the pre-service teachers and generative AI separately. We identified that, although Ernie Bot provided significantly better feedback than the pre-service teachers in three specific areas (except for language expression), and both Ernie Bot and the pre-service teachers had respective advantages in terms of writing strategy, human–computer cooperative writing feedback was significantly better than the writing feedback provided by either Ernie Bot or the pre-service teachers alone. The was true across all aspects of the feedback in terms of focus and strategy. These findings can support the training of pre-service teachers and improve the writing quality of their students via implementing AI to provide more effective writing feedback.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=51be36a6-4>\nTitle: Generative AI in K-12 Education: The CyberScholar Initiative\nSnippet: The main objective of the present paper was to investigate the extent to which the GenAI tool --CyberScholar --can support K-12 students' writing in diverse subject areas. The results show that the tool has substantial potential to improve students' writing and support teachers in their instruction. It is important to note that participants acknowledged the potential to support writing but not to replace teacher feedback. \n\nThe AI assistant allowed timely and detailed feedback integrated into the teachers' specific rubric, content, and subject. For students, the CyberScholar tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition. \n\nOn the teaching side, the findings demonstrate a potential evolution in teachers' roles, moving from sole evaluators to managers of AI feedback loops, in ways that deepen students' writing and critical thinking. The study also suggests a need for classroom designs that support iterative revisions, inquiry-based dialogues, and personalized human-machine learning pathways. \n\nto enhance clarity, coherence, and correctness. The prompts used include \"Correct grammar\" and \"Proofread for academic writing but don't change the original meaning or structure of the text\". While the authors acknowledge the usage of AI, they maintain that they are the sole authors of this article and take full responsibility for the content therein, as outlined in COPE recommendations.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nWe have two rounds of evidence: (1) broad K–12 AI frameworks and taxonomies that can scaffold the report’s structure, and (2) early empirical case studies on generative AI for writing feedback in middle/high school contexts. These establish categories (instructional/analytical/administrative) and a design perspective, and they provide concrete examples around feedback and writing support. However, we still need: \n- Global, concrete classroom applications beyond writing (e.g., assessment/test generation, paraphrasing/summarization for ELL, coding/problem generation, creative arts).\n- District-level or country implementations and guardrails/ethics.\n- Practical implementation methods (teacher PD, workflow integration, classroom management).\n\nNext, I will search for empirical or case-study evidence on generative AI for assessment/test generation and paraphrasing/translation in K–12, aiming for international examples (US, China, Europe).\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" limit=\"5\" year=\"2022-2025\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Education,Computer Science\">K-12 generative AI assessment test generation classroom case study primary secondary</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=bba4d159-0>\nTitle: Generative AI and ChatGPT in School Children’s Education: Evidence from a School Lesson\nSnippet: This article presents an examination of the application of generative AI in primary school education, specifically focusing on how pupils learn during a school lesson where the text, illustrations, and exercises have been designed and personalized using generative AI based on each pupil's knowledge and interest in the topic. This article, therefore, responds to the widely recognized need, expressed by scholars and education managers, to study how generative AI and ChatGPT function in school education practices, e.g., [7][8][9]16,[32][33][34]. \n\nThe study involved a total of 110 pupils, aged 8-14 years old, who utilized laptop computers to access the learning material. The research was conducted in Uruguay, specifically within the context of the Social Sciences (History) curriculum and a lesson for the 4th-, 5thand 6th-grade pupils. The application used belongs the Digileac platform, which provides a digitally assisted learning environment supported by the use of generative AI [18]. \n\nThis article provides a detailed explanation of the process involved in creating the lesson, learning material and the assessment methods employed. This information is crucial for understanding the procedures involved in designing future tests effectively. The overall number of analyzed pupils was rather limited and analysis was conducted only regarding one study topic, so for broader generalization, wider samples and other studies would be needed. Nevertheless, as indicated above, already this study indicates how generative AI can be easily and very effectively used to generate learning material for pupils with different knowledge bases on the topics of the lesson. \n\nThe analysis indicates that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, as one example of generative AI, to personalize and customize learning material so that it would match the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. Differences were observed among pupils regarding their reading time of the learning material as well as regarding their answering time to open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The time varied between genders and among pupils from the 4th to 6th grade; however, a more detailed analysis requires larger data. Overall, two out of three pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI modified material with the laptop, and only one out of ten liked it only a little or not at all.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=bba4d159-1>\nTitle: Thematic and Task-Based Categorization of K-12 GenAI Usages with Hierarchical Topic Modeling\nSnippet: In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of over 17,000 anonymized interactions between minors and generative AI in real-world K-12 educational settings offers critical insights that bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical classroom implementation. By systematically categorizing these interactions across both content and task dimensions, our findings provide educators with a nuanced understanding of student interests, learning needs, and emerging use cases for GenAI. This two dimensional framework not only informs pedagogi-cal practice but also lays the groundwork for future research and innovation in the responsible integration of GenAI into K-12 education. For example, future research might further partition K-12 into different age groups. \n\nOur content categorization reveals a broad spectrum of student interests, ranging from traditional educational subjects such as language learning and natural sciences to more personal and exploratory domains like relationships, health, and career aspirations. This diversity underscores the potential of generative AI to support not only academic learning but also personal development and social-emotional growth. \n\nFrom a task perspective, our analysis highlights the multifaceted role generative AI can play in educational settings-from offering creative and motivational support to facilitating reflective writing and structured feedback. Particularly noteworthy is the potential of generative AI to enhance creativity, reflective thinking, and emotional well-being, areas that are often insufficiently addressed by conventional educational tools. \n\nHowever, these opportunities are accompanied by important challenges and open questions. The increasing reliance on generative AI demands increased attention to AI literacy and critical thinking skills among students, particularly in light of potential inaccuracies, biases, and ethical risks. Thus, future research must address these issues, including the long-term educational implications, development of ethical guidelines, and the assurance of equitable access to generative AI tools in schools. \n\nOverall, our study contributes to an evidence-based framework for integrating generative AI responsibly and effectively into educational practice, benefiting students, teachers, curriculum designers, and policymakers alike.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=bba4d159-2>\nTitle: Race with the machines: Assessing the capability of generative AI in solving authentic assessments\nSnippet: Four teaching staff members independently grade the generative AI-generated answers using predefined marking criteria, scoring from 0 to 100. This evaluation process allowed us to measure the proficiency of different generative AI in generating answers for takehome assessments. Ultimately, the examination of the grades obtained from Bloom's taxonomy questions provides valuable insights into the capabilities of various generative AI in handling assignment tasks. Detailed descriptions of the assessment design process, rubrics, marking guides, input procedures for AI tools and the evaluation of AI-generated answers are presented in the following sections. \n\nOur framework is designed to be adaptable, and educators can employ it as a guideline to evaluate emerging or existing generative AI tools, enabling systematic evaluations. The framework can also be utilised to assess the performance of generative AI tools in addressing both advanced assignment tasks in economics and assignments from various other disciplines. Educators could follow the framework, as depicted in Figure 1, to formulate the assignment questions, marking rubrics and guidelines, and subsequently, integrate these inputs into generative AI tools to obtain the results. Subsequently, educators would need to evaluate the responses generated by the generative AI tools. \n\nFor the prompting generation process, we acknowledge that the effectiveness of AI tools, particularly ChatGPT-3.5, hinges significantly on the quality of the prompts provided. The formulation of prompts was an iterative process, refined through testing and feedback to align with the objectives of the assessment tasks (see more details in Appendix B).\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=bba4d159-3>\nTitle: I see you: teacher analytics with GPT-4 vision-powered observational assessment\nSnippet: The primary goal of this study is to explore and validate the integration of advanced generative AI (GenAI) technologies, particularly GPT-4V, in educational assessment.We aim to develop, explore, and test the effectiveness of a VidAAS that leverages the capabilities of GPT-4V for observational assessment.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=bba4d159-4>\nTitle: AI + Ethics Curricula for Middle School Youth: Lessons Learned from Three Project-Based Curricula\nSnippet: Existing resources for K-12 AI education are generally short, informal learning opportunities that focus on a particular concept or big idea in AI. However, as De la Higuera (2019) argues, schools should make time to teach AI in their classrooms given the relevance of AI in children's lives. This paper details our steps toward making curricula that are practical for classroom by centering student and teacher needs in our design. There are few published pieces on preparing in-service teachers to bring AI education to their classrooms. In one of the most notable examples, Vazhayil et al. (2019) trained 24 secondary school teachers (for students ages 14 to 18) to teach a project-based AI curriculum based on ML4Kids (Vazhayil et al., 2019). The research uncovered potential barriers for broader adoption of such a curriculum, including making tools that are suitable for classrooms with different technological needs, considering the pedagogical strategies used to deliver content, and ensuring that teachers had the knowledge and resources they needed to support their students as they learned. We designed our curricula to address these issues.\n\nThe ubiquity of machine learning algorithms makes them a relatable target for students growing up in this AI-infused age, hence most educational resources teach the basics of supervised machine learning (Marques et al., 2020). More recently, K-12 curricula developed by academic researchers are moving beyond machine learning and teaching more cutting-edge AI topics to students. For instance, generative ML, or AI that can generate new media, is a recent innovation in the field of AI. One of the most common algorithms used for generative ML is called generative adversarial networks, or GANs (Goodfellow, et al., 2014). While GANs can serve as a tool for enhancing creativity in children (Ali et al., 2020), they can also be used to generate fake media that is meant to deceive others (Nguyen et al., 2019). Generative AI tools have been used to create deepfake photos and videos that circulate on popular social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Students begin to be exposed to AI generated media in middle school, as they make their first social media accounts. Unfortunately, to our knowledge\n</snippet></tool_output> \n<think>\nI have gathered four batches of evidence so far: (1) broad K–12 AI frameworks and taxonomies that can scaffold a structured report; (2) early empirical case studies on generative AI for writing feedback in middle/high school contexts; (3) additional evidence on assessment/test generation and student-facing GenAI usage patterns; and (4) a school-level primary classroom case (Uruguay) plus ethics/curriculum design considerations. These give me a base to build a framework and category discussions, with concrete examples from the US, Uruguay, and China, and design/ethics insights.\n\nWhat remains missing to strengthen the global perspective and actionable guidance:\n- District- or country-level implementations and outcomes (e.g., UK Ofsted/England, Singapore, Finland/Nordics, China at scale).\n- STEM-specific applications (coding, math problem generation) and classroom management/engagement tools (summarization, paraphrasing, idea generation).\n- Authoritative guidance on risks, safety, and guardrails (UNESCO/US DOE/Ofsted).\n- Practical implementation methods: teacher PD, workflow integration, classroom activity designs, and evaluation rubrics.\n\nGiven the time and search limit, I will synthesize with the current evidence and focus the recommendations on guardrails and integration patterns, while clearly noting scope and limitations where generalization is constrained by sample size or context.\n</think>\n<answer>\n# Executive Summary\n\nAcross primary and secondary classrooms globally, schools are experimenting with AI-generated content (AIGC) to personalize learning materials, provide formative feedback, scaffold writing, and generate assessments, with early evidence pointing to gains in timeliness and detail of feedback and in personalization of content when GenAI is used under teacher oversight.<cite id=\"c0bee8cc-0\">Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolutionizes education by supporting personalized learning, critical thinking, and problem solving through tools like intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive platforms, with K–12 reviews classifying AI tools by instructional, administrative, and analytical uses and discussing ethical concerns such as data privacy and algorithmic biases</cite><cite id=\"51be36a6-1\">A K–12 GenAI assistant (CyberScholar) provided detailed, rubric-aligned feedback across English, social studies, and history classes, with students perceiving it as valuable for refining writing and teachers shifting to guiding roles around AI feedback processes</cite><cite id=\"bba4d159-0\">In Uruguay, a primary school lesson used GenAI (Digileac) to personalize texts, illustrations, and exercises per pupil knowledge and interest, with 4th–6th graders showing varied engagement and differing times on tasks</cite><cite id=\"bba4d159-1\">An analysis of 17,000+ anonymized K–12 GenAI interactions mapped content and task categories, highlighting language learning, creativity, reflective writing, and structured feedback while underscoring the need for AI literacy to address inaccuracies, bias, and ethics</cite>.

Visionary educators recognize AI’s potential in the classroom. According to IBM, AI will not completely replace humans, but those who use AI will replace those who do not. This statement emphasizes the importance of integrating AI in K-12 education. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of AI tools and platforms for K-12 education, with the hope of serving as a practical reference for teachers to use these tools. This review discusses the definitions and types of AI for education. It further identifies and reviews currently available and popular AI tools and their applications in K-12 education. It offers quick references for teachers on how they can harness various AI tools for different teaching and learning purposes, along with addressing ethical concerns such as data privacy and algorithmic biases. This article classifies AI tools on the basis of instructional, administrative, and analytical usage to address diverse needs, enhance teaching and learning, provide personalized instruction, and predict student outcomes. This review also provides information for teachers to choose appropriate AI tools for specific purposes. The use of AI tools and associated concerns in the K-12 classrooms are also discussed, encouraging teachers to create more dynamic, inclusive, and effective learning environments while preparing students for the future. This article also offers future directions for researchers and product developers regarding the use of AI in K-12 education.\n\nTitle: Designing AI Learning Experiences for K-12: Emerging Works, Future Opportunities and a Design Framework\nSnippet: Touretzky et al. pioneered identifying what K-12 students should know about AI. In [54], they listed a variety of AI teaching and learning resources for K-12, presented five Big AI Ideas for young learners, and elaborated on them for four grade bands: K-2, 3-5. 6-8, and 9-12. Many recent works have used the Big AI Ideas to develop effective K-12 AI tools and curriculum [3,29,41,53]. \n\nDue to the nascency of the field, few literature reviews on AI/ML education for K-12 students exist. In one of the most recent reviews, Marques et al. conducted a systematic mapping with a focus on ML instructional units (IUs) in elementary to high schools. The researchers set their scope with respect to the IUs (\"a set of classes [...] designed to teach certain learning objectives to a specific target audience\"), presented the ML competencies currently taught in existing IUs, the application domains covered, the types of data utilized, and the types of instructional methods and materials used. They emphasized the importance of teaching young students about AI, how to implement the IUs as extracurricular units, a need for K-12 AI assessment, and the trade-off between creating transparent systems to provide more comprehensive information and simplifying or \"black-boxing\" underlying ML concepts to avoid cognitive overload. They also identified a lack of training for K-12 teachers to implement the IUs in their classrooms. Nonetheless, the authors also mentioned how existing IUs not published in scientific articles (e.g., tools developed by those outside the research community) were not evaluated. Furthermore, they only analyzed ML IUs, rather than AI curricula in general. \n\nAnother study, [30], analyzed curricula with a broader focus on AI. The objective of the study was to create an AI Literacy framework for developing tools and curricula for a general, nontechnical audience, including learners outside of K-12 [30]. The authors thematically derived a list of AI competencies and design considerations from existing research and AI learning resources and proposed a conceptual framework to guide HCI researchers' in developing AI curricula.\n\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence Applications in K-12 Education: A Systematic Literature Review\nSnippet: In this systematic review, the integration of AI and k-12 education is being investigated in terms of the application of the proposed systems, the role and type of AI, and targeted course and level. According to the questions of this study, the inclusion criteria were obtained to define which studies should be included in the review.\n\nTitle: Designing AI Learning Experiences for K-12: Emerging Works, Future Opportunities and a Design Framework\nSnippet: Furthermore, we explored specifically how design considerations may differ in K-12 learning contexts and where there are gaps in the literature. \n\nWe conducted an exploratory review of AI for K-12 education (AI4K12) literature and tools in order to distill a design framework to inform development of AI learning experiences for K-12. We examined work that falls under AI education and AI literacy, but narrowed our search within a K-12 learning grade band, though we occasionally drew inspiration from adjacent work in other fields or higher learning grade bands (i.e., general computer science education and university-level education). We then organized key design elements in a conceptual framework that we thematically derived from the literature. \n\nThe main contributions of this paper are: \n\n(1) An analysis of how existing work applies general AI literacy competencies and design considerations; (2) A design framework for designers and researchers creating K-12 AI education tools; \n\n(3) A reference chart for educators selecting AI educational tools to suit the needs of their classrooms. \n\nAs K-12 AI education continues to grow and evolve, we expect this analysis and framework to be further refined as well. We present this paper as a stepping stone for other designers and researchers to create better AI educational experiences for K-12 learners, so that their students may also become the designers and researchers of AI education in the future.\n\nTitle: Pedagogical incorporation of artificial intelligence in K-12 science education: A decadal bibliometric mapping and systematic literature review (2013-2023)\nSnippet: While offering valuable insights, their study's focus on trends and research foci underscores the need for a more comprehensive review that explicitly addresses the pedagogical incorporation of AI within K-12 science classrooms. \n\nIn conclusion, existing systematic reviews on AISE often overlook recent advancements and have narrow scopes, while some lack a comprehensive analysis of AI's pedagogical implications in K-12 science education. Addressing these gaps is essential for thoroughly understanding AI's role in science education, thereby building on the findings from this review; a conceptual framework (Figure 1) was developed, guided by the research questions outlined in this study, to systematically address the identified gaps and provide a foundation for further investigation. This framework is informed by constructivist and social constructivist theories, focusing on six key dimensions: Leading Journals, Influential Papers, Authors, and Country contributions, which offer insight into the principal sources and contributors in the field; AI Technologies, which examines the specific AI technologies utilized in K-12 science classrooms; Educational Grade Levels, which explores the variation in AI integration across different educational stages; Research Methodologies, which reviews the approaches used to study AI's impact; Pedagogical Approaches, which considers various strategies for integrating AI with classroom teaching practices; and Impact on Learning Outcomes, which evaluates the effects of AI on student performance and engagement. By synthesizing these dimensions, the framework facilitates a thorough understanding of AI's role in science education, highlights areas needing further research, and guides the study's exploration of AI's integration and pedagogical implications. Subsequently, a bibliometric mapping and a systematic literature review [SLR] of empirical studies on AI's integration in K-12 science education from 2013 to 2023 were conducted using the PRISMA framework, further refining the scope and focus of the research.",

Visionary educators recognize AI’s potential in the classroom. According to IBM, AI will not completely replace humans, but those who use AI will replace those who do not. This statement emphasizes the importance of integrating AI in K-12 education. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of AI tools and platforms for K-12 education, with the hope of serving as a practical reference for teachers to use these tools. This review discusses the definitions and types of AI for education. It further identifies and reviews currently available and popular AI tools and their applications in K-12 education. It offers quick references for teachers on how they can harness various AI tools for different teaching and learning purposes, along with addressing ethical concerns such as data privacy and algorithmic biases. This article classifies AI tools on the basis of instructional, administrative, and analytical usage to address diverse needs, enhance teaching and learning, provide personalized instruction, and predict student outcomes. This review also provides information for teachers to choose appropriate AI tools for specific purposes. The use of AI tools and associated concerns in the K-12 classrooms are also discussed, encouraging teachers to create more dynamic, inclusive, and effective learning environments while preparing students for the future. This article also offers future directions for researchers and product developers regarding the use of AI in K-12 education.",

In [54], they listed a variety of AI teaching and learning resources for K-12, presented five Big AI Ideas for young learners, and elaborated on them for four grade bands: K-2, 3-5. 6-8, and 9-12. Many recent works have used the Big AI Ideas to develop effective K-12 AI tools and curriculum [3,29,41,53]. \n\nDue to the nascency of the field, few literature reviews on AI/ML education for K-12 students exist. In one of the most recent reviews, Marques et al. conducted a systematic mapping with a focus on ML instructional units (IUs) in elementary to high schools. The researchers set their scope with respect to the IUs (\"a set of classes [...] designed to teach certain learning objectives to a specific target audience\"), presented the ML competencies currently taught in existing IUs, the application domains covered, the types of data utilized, and the types of instructional methods and materials used. They emphasized the importance of teaching young students about AI, how to implement the IUs as extracurricular units, a need for K-12 AI assessment, and the trade-off between creating transparent systems to provide more comprehensive information and simplifying or \"black-boxing\" underlying ML concepts to avoid cognitive overload. They also identified a lack of training for K-12 teachers to implement the IUs in their classrooms. Nonetheless, the authors also mentioned how existing IUs not published in scientific articles (e.g., tools developed by those outside the research community) were not evaluated. Furthermore, they only analyzed ML IUs, rather than AI curricula in general. \n\nAnother study, [30], analyzed curricula with a broader focus on AI. The objective of the study was to create an AI Literacy framework for developing tools and curricula for a general, nontechnical audience, including learners outside of K-12 [30]. The authors thematically derived a list of AI competencies and design considerations from existing research and AI learning resources and proposed a conceptual framework to guide HCI researchers' in developing AI curricula.",

        "output": "Title: Exploring the Effectiveness of Cooperative Pre-Service Teacher and Generative AI Writing Feedback on Chinese Writing\nSnippet: Based on a structured interview, 11 pre-service teachers expressed their overall and specific perceptions about the writing feedback provided by generative AI. They expressed a willingness to cooperate with generative AI, even offering insights on how to effectively cooperate with AI to provide writing feedback. First, the 11 pre-service teachers were asked to think critically about the role of generative AI in providing writing feedback, both in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. The pre-service teachers were more likely to recognize the advantages, as opposed to the disadvantages, of generative AI for providing writing feedback, including saving time, reducing their workload, and providing specific suggestions. It must be acknowledged that generative AI has become an unstoppable force that is now widely used (M. Zhu et al., 2020). The perceptions of pre-service teachers were in line with the development trend of AI (Wambsganss et al., 2022). Additionally, all 11 pre-service teachers indicated their willingness to cooperate with generative AI in providing writing feedback, recognizing that it could complement their strengths and make the provided writing feedback more effective, comprehensive, personalized, and emotional. This further demonstrates the effectiveness and universality of the theory of human-machine collaboration (Wang, 2019). Finally, the pre-service teachers discussed the dynamics of cooperating with generative AI, stating that teachers should remain the authority and generative AI should be used as a tool to provide writing feedback. This helps to clarify the cooperative relationship when using generative AI to provide writing feedback. Based on the theory of human-machine collaboration and the interviews of 11 pre-service teachers, this study suggests adopting a teacher-led approach, with AI used as an auxiliary tool to provide writing feedback.\n\nTitle: Generative AI in K-12 Education: The CyberScholar Initiative\nSnippet: This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI assistant tool that aims to provide formative feedback on writing in K-12 contexts. Specifically, this study explores how students worked with CyberScholar in diverse subject areas, including English Language Arts, Social Studies, and Modern World History classes in Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the United States. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to support K-12 students'writing in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments. Data were collected through implementation observations, surveys, and interviews by participating 121 students and 4 teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed that the feedback tool was perceived as a valuable tool for supporting student writing through detailed feedback, enhanced interactivity, and alignment with rubric criteria. Students appreciated the tool's guidance in refining their writing. For the students, the assistant tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition. For the teaching side, the findings indicate a shift in teachers'roles, from serving primarily as evaluators to guiding AI feedback processes that foster better student writing and critical thinking.\n\nTitle: Exploring the Effectiveness of Cooperative Pre-Service Teacher and Generative AI Writing Feedback on Chinese Writing\nSnippet: With the rapid development of information technology, intelligent technology is gradually penetrating the field of education, providing infinite possibilities for innovative teaching methods. Among these methods, generative AI, with its powerful natural language processing ability, has changed the means of providing feedback in the teaching of writing and has become an increasingly efficient and user-friendly writing feedback tool (Wambsganss et al., 2022;M. Zhu et al., 2020). However, despite the many theoretical advantages of generative-AI-based feedback, there is a lack of in-depth research on the effectiveness of its practical application in the field of language writing for primary school students. Cultivating primary school students' writing skills is a critical objective in foundational education, profoundly shaping the students' development in verbal expression, logical thinking, and emotional articulation (Yao, 2013). In this process, teacher feedback plays a crucial role, not only helping students to identify and correct errors in their writing but also promoting the improvement of their writing skills and development of their thought processes (Bitchener & Storch, 2016;Cheng et al., 2021;Schuldt, 2019;Graham et al., Behav. Sci. 2025, 15, 518 2 of 22 2015). However, in practice, teacher feedback is often affected by a variety of factors, such as personal subjective factors, time, and energy, and it is difficult to ensure accurate and consistent feedback (L. Huang, 2009). In contrast, generative AI can provide more objective and accurate feedback through big data analysis and algorithmic optimization (Crompton & Burke, 2023). At the same time, generative AI can also quickly process a large amount of student work, saving teachers a lot of time and improving their work efficiency (Mizumoto & Eguchi, 2023). However, despite the advantages of generative AI feedback, there are still many controversies regarding its use as a complete replacement for teacher feedback. Firstly, the feedback from generative AI cannot completely replace human interactions and the role of teachers in developing social and emotional skills. Human interactions play a crucial role in building relationships, empathy, and collaborative learning, which AI may struggle to replicate (Haleem et al., 2022).\n\nTitle: Exploring the Effectiveness of Cooperative Pre-Service Teacher and Generative AI Writing Feedback on Chinese Writing\nSnippet: Due to their efficiency, stability, and enhanced language comprehension and analysis capabilities, generative AIs have attracted increasing attention in the field of writing as higher-level automated writing evaluation (AWE) feedback tools. However, few studies have examined the impact of pre-service teachers using generative AI in combination with their own teaching experience to provide feedback on Chinese writing. To fill this gap, based on 1035 writing feedback texts, we examined the differences in writing feedback between 11 pre-service teachers and Erine Bot (a generative AI) and interviewed the pre-service teachers about their willingness to cooperate with generative AI. The collaborative writing feedback generated by the pre-service teachers using AI was compared with the feedback generated by the pre-service teachers and generative AI separately. We identified that, although Ernie Bot provided significantly better feedback than the pre-service teachers in three specific areas (except for language expression), and both Ernie Bot and the pre-service teachers had respective advantages in terms of writing strategy, human–computer cooperative writing feedback was significantly better than the writing feedback provided by either Ernie Bot or the pre-service teachers alone. The was true across all aspects of the feedback in terms of focus and strategy. These findings can support the training of pre-service teachers and improve the writing quality of their students via implementing AI to provide more effective writing feedback.\n\nTitle: Generative AI in K-12 Education: The CyberScholar Initiative\nSnippet: The main objective of the present paper was to investigate the extent to which the GenAI tool --CyberScholar --can support K-12 students' writing in diverse subject areas. The results show that the tool has substantial potential to improve students' writing and support teachers in their instruction. It is important to note that participants acknowledged the potential to support writing but not to replace teacher feedback. \n\nThe AI assistant allowed timely and detailed feedback integrated into the teachers' specific rubric, content, and subject. For students, the CyberScholar tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition. \n\nOn the teaching side, the findings demonstrate a potential evolution in teachers' roles, moving from sole evaluators to managers of AI feedback loops, in ways that deepen students' writing and critical thinking. The study also suggests a need for classroom designs that support iterative revisions, inquiry-based dialogues, and personalized human-machine learning pathways. \n\nto enhance clarity, coherence, and correctness. The prompts used include \"Correct grammar\" and \"Proofread for academic writing but don't change the original meaning or structure of the text\". While the authors acknowledge the usage of AI, they maintain that they are the sole authors of this article and take full responsibility for the content therein, as outlined in COPE recommendations.",

                "text": "Based on a structured interview, 11 pre-service teachers expressed their overall and specific perceptions about the writing feedback provided by generative AI. They expressed a willingness to cooperate with generative AI, even offering insights on how to effectively cooperate with AI to provide writing feedback. First, the 11 pre-service teachers were asked to think critically about the role of generative AI in providing writing feedback, both in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. The pre-service teachers were more likely to recognize the advantages, as opposed to the disadvantages, of generative AI for providing writing feedback, including saving time, reducing their workload, and providing specific suggestions. It must be acknowledged that generative AI has become an unstoppable force that is now widely used (M. Zhu et al., 2020). The perceptions of pre-service teachers were in line with the development trend of AI (Wambsganss et al., 2022). Additionally, all 11 pre-service teachers indicated their willingness to cooperate with generative AI in providing writing feedback, recognizing that it could complement their strengths and make the provided writing feedback more effective, comprehensive, personalized, and emotional. This further demonstrates the effectiveness and universality of the theory of human-machine collaboration (Wang, 2019). Finally, the pre-service teachers discussed the dynamics of cooperating with generative AI, stating that teachers should remain the authority and generative AI should be used as a tool to provide writing feedback. This helps to clarify the cooperative relationship when using generative AI to provide writing feedback. Based on the theory of human-machine collaboration and the interviews of 11 pre-service teachers, this study suggests adopting a teacher-led approach, with AI used as an auxiliary tool to provide writing feedback.",

            "snippet": "Based on a structured interview, 11 pre-service teachers expressed their overall and specific perceptions about the writing feedback provided by generative AI. They expressed a willingness to cooperate with generative AI, even offering insights on how to effectively cooperate with AI to provide writing feedback. First, the 11 pre-service teachers were asked to think critically about the role of generative AI in providing writing feedback, both in terms of its advantages and disadvantages. The pre-service teachers were more likely to recognize the advantages, as opposed to the disadvantages, of generative AI for providing writing feedback, including saving time, reducing their workload, and providing specific suggestions. It must be acknowledged that generative AI has become an unstoppable force that is now widely used (M. Zhu et al., 2020). The perceptions of pre-service teachers were in line with the development trend of AI (Wambsganss et al., 2022). Additionally, all 11 pre-service teachers indicated their willingness to cooperate with generative AI in providing writing feedback, recognizing that it could complement their strengths and make the provided writing feedback more effective, comprehensive, personalized, and emotional. This further demonstrates the effectiveness and universality of the theory of human-machine collaboration (Wang, 2019). Finally, the pre-service teachers discussed the dynamics of cooperating with generative AI, stating that teachers should remain the authority and generative AI should be used as a tool to provide writing feedback. This helps to clarify the cooperative relationship when using generative AI to provide writing feedback. Based on the theory of human-machine collaboration and the interviews of 11 pre-service teachers, this study suggests adopting a teacher-led approach, with AI used as an auxiliary tool to provide writing feedback.",

This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to support K-12 students'writing in diverse subject areas requiring written assignments. Data were collected through implementation observations, surveys, and interviews by participating 121 students and 4 teachers. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed that the feedback tool was perceived as a valuable tool for supporting student writing through detailed feedback, enhanced interactivity, and alignment with rubric criteria. Students appreciated the tool's guidance in refining their writing. For the students, the assistant tool suggests restructuring feedback as a dynamic, dialogic process rather than a static evaluation, a shift that aligns with the cyber-social learning idea, self-regulation, and metacognition.

            "snippet": "With the rapid development of information technology, intelligent technology is gradually penetrating the field of education, providing infinite possibilities for innovative teaching methods. Among these methods, generative AI, with its powerful natural language processing ability, has changed the means of providing feedback in the teaching of writing and has become an increasingly efficient and user-friendly writing feedback tool (Wambsganss et al., 2022;M. Zhu et al., 2020). However, despite the many theoretical advantages of generative-AI-based feedback, there is a lack of in-depth research on the effectiveness of its practical application in the field of language writing for primary school students. Cultivating primary school students' writing skills is a critical objective in foundational education, profoundly shaping the students' development in verbal expression, logical thinking, and emotional articulation (Yao, 2013). In this process, teacher feedback plays a crucial role, not only helping students to identify and correct errors in their writing but also promoting the improvement of their writing skills and development of their thought processes (Bitchener & Storch, 2016;Cheng et al., 2021;Schuldt, 2019;Graham et al., Behav. Sci. 2025, 15, 518 2 of 22 2015). However, in practice, teacher feedback is often affected by a variety of factors, such as personal subjective factors, time, and energy, and it is difficult to ensure accurate and consistent feedback (L. Huang, 2009). In contrast, generative AI can provide more objective and accurate feedback through big data analysis and algorithmic optimization (Crompton & Burke, 2023). At the same time, generative AI can also quickly process a large amount of student work, saving teachers a lot of time and improving their work efficiency (Mizumoto & Eguchi, 2023). However, despite the advantages of generative AI feedback, there are still many controversies regarding its use as a complete replacement for teacher feedback. Firstly, the feedback from generative AI cannot completely replace human interactions and the role of teachers in developing social and emotional skills. Human interactions play a crucial role in building relationships, empathy, and collaborative learning, which AI may struggle to replicate (Haleem et al., 2022).",

This article, therefore, responds to the widely recognized need, expressed by scholars and education managers, to study how generative AI and ChatGPT function in school education practices, e.g., [7][8][9]16,[32][33][34]. \n\nThe study involved a total of 110 pupils, aged 8-14 years old, who utilized laptop computers to access the learning material. The research was conducted in Uruguay, specifically within the context of the Social Sciences (History) curriculum and a lesson for the 4th-, 5thand 6th-grade pupils. The application used belongs the Digileac platform, which provides a digitally assisted learning environment supported by the use of generative AI [18]. \n\nThis article provides a detailed explanation of the process involved in creating the lesson, learning material and the assessment methods employed. This information is crucial for understanding the procedures involved in designing future tests effectively. The overall number of analyzed pupils was rather limited and analysis was conducted only regarding one study topic, so for broader generalization, wider samples and other studies would be needed. Nevertheless, as indicated above, already this study indicates how generative AI can be easily and very effectively used to generate learning material for pupils with different knowledge bases on the topics of the lesson. \n\nThe analysis indicates that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, as one example of generative AI, to personalize and customize learning material so that it would match the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. Differences were observed among pupils regarding their reading time of the learning material as well as regarding their answering time to open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The time varied between genders and among pupils from the 4th to 6th grade; however, a more detailed analysis requires larger data. Overall, two out of three pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI modified material with the laptop, and only one out of ten liked it only a little or not at all.\n\nTitle: Thematic and Task-Based Categorization of K-12 GenAI Usages with Hierarchical Topic Modeling\nSnippet: In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of over 17,000 anonymized interactions between minors and generative AI in real-world K-12 educational settings offers critical insights that bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical classroom implementation. By systematically categorizing these interactions across both content and task dimensions, our findings provide educators with a nuanced understanding of student interests, learning needs, and emerging use cases for GenAI. This two dimensional framework not only informs pedagogi-cal practice but also lays the groundwork for future research and innovation in the responsible integration of GenAI into K-12 education. For example, future research might further partition K-12 into different age groups. \n\nOur content categorization reveals a broad spectrum of student interests, ranging from traditional educational subjects such as language learning and natural sciences to more personal and exploratory domains like relationships, health, and career aspirations. This diversity underscores the potential of generative AI to support not only academic learning but also personal development and social-emotional growth. \n\nFrom a task perspective, our analysis highlights the multifaceted role generative AI can play in educational settings-from offering creative and motivational support to facilitating reflective writing and structured feedback. Particularly noteworthy is the potential of generative AI to enhance creativity, reflective thinking, and emotional well-being, areas that are often insufficiently addressed by conventional educational tools. \n\nHowever, these opportunities are accompanied by important challenges and open questions. The increasing reliance on generative AI demands increased attention to AI literacy and critical thinking skills among students, particularly in light of potential inaccuracies, biases, and ethical risks. Thus, future research must address these issues, including the long-term educational implications, development of ethical guidelines, and the assurance of equitable access to generative AI tools in schools. \n\nOverall, our study contributes to an evidence-based framework for integrating generative AI responsibly and effectively into educational practice, benefiting students, teachers, curriculum designers, and policymakers alike.\n\nTitle: Race with the machines: Assessing the capability of generative AI in solving authentic assessments\nSnippet: Four teaching staff members independently grade the generative AI-generated answers using predefined marking criteria, scoring from 0 to 100. This evaluation process allowed us to measure the proficiency of different generative AI in generating answers for takehome assessments. Ultimately, the examination of the grades obtained from Bloom's taxonomy questions provides valuable insights into the capabilities of various generative AI in handling assignment tasks. Detailed descriptions of the assessment design process, rubrics, marking guides, input procedures for AI tools and the evaluation of AI-generated answers are presented in the following sections. \n\nOur framework is designed to be adaptable, and educators can employ it as a guideline to evaluate emerging or existing generative AI tools, enabling systematic evaluations. The framework can also be utilised to assess the performance of generative AI tools in addressing both advanced assignment tasks in economics and assignments from various other disciplines. Educators could follow the framework, as depicted in Figure 1, to formulate the assignment questions, marking rubrics and guidelines, and subsequently, integrate these inputs into generative AI tools to obtain the results. Subsequently, educators would need to evaluate the responses generated by the generative AI tools. \n\nFor the prompting generation process, we acknowledge that the effectiveness of AI tools, particularly ChatGPT-3.5, hinges significantly on the quality of the prompts provided. The formulation of prompts was an iterative process, refined through testing and feedback to align with the objectives of the assessment tasks (see more details in Appendix B).\n\nTitle: I see you: teacher analytics with GPT-4 vision-powered observational assessment\nSnippet: The primary goal of this study is to explore and validate the integration of advanced generative AI (GenAI) technologies, particularly GPT-4V, in educational assessment.We aim to develop, explore, and test the effectiveness of a VidAAS that leverages the capabilities of GPT-4V for observational assessment.\n\nTitle: AI + Ethics Curricula for Middle School Youth: Lessons Learned from Three Project-Based Curricula\nSnippet: Existing resources for K-12 AI education are generally short, informal learning opportunities that focus on a particular concept or big idea in AI. However, as De la Higuera (2019) argues, schools should make time to teach AI in their classrooms given the relevance of AI in children's lives. This paper details our steps toward making curricula that are practical for classroom by centering student and teacher needs in our design. There are few published pieces on preparing in-service teachers to bring AI education to their classrooms. In one of the most notable examples, Vazhayil et al. (2019) trained 24 secondary school teachers (for students ages 14 to 18) to teach a project-based AI curriculum based on ML4Kids (Vazhayil et al., 2019). The research uncovered potential barriers for broader adoption of such a curriculum, including making tools that are suitable for classrooms with different technological needs, considering the pedagogical strategies used to deliver content, and ensuring that teachers had the knowledge and resources they needed to support their students as they learned. We designed our curricula to address these issues.\n\nThe ubiquity of machine learning algorithms makes them a relatable target for students growing up in this AI-infused age, hence most educational resources teach the basics of supervised machine learning (Marques et al., 2020). More recently, K-12 curricula developed by academic researchers are moving beyond machine learning and teaching more cutting-edge AI topics to students. For instance, generative ML, or AI that can generate new media, is a recent innovation in the field of AI. One of the most common algorithms used for generative ML is called generative adversarial networks, or GANs (Goodfellow, et al., 2014). While GANs can serve as a tool for enhancing creativity in children (Ali et al., 2020), they can also be used to generate fake media that is meant to deceive others (Nguyen et al., 2019). Generative AI tools have been used to create deepfake photos and videos that circulate on popular social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Students begin to be exposed to AI generated media in middle school, as they make their first social media accounts. Unfortunately, to our knowledge",

                "text": "This article presents an examination of the application of generative AI in primary school education, specifically focusing on how pupils learn during a school lesson where the text, illustrations, and exercises have been designed and personalized using generative AI based on each pupil's knowledge and interest in the topic. This article, therefore, responds to the widely recognized need, expressed by scholars and education managers, to study how generative AI and ChatGPT function in school education practices, e.g., [7][8][9]16,[32][33][34]. \n\nThe study involved a total of 110 pupils, aged 8-14 years old, who utilized laptop computers to access the learning material. The research was conducted in Uruguay, specifically within the context of the Social Sciences (History) curriculum and a lesson for the 4th-, 5thand 6th-grade pupils. The application used belongs the Digileac platform, which provides a digitally assisted learning environment supported by the use of generative AI [18]. \n\nThis article provides a detailed explanation of the process involved in creating the lesson, learning material and the assessment methods employed. This information is crucial for understanding the procedures involved in designing future tests effectively. The overall number of analyzed pupils was rather limited and analysis was conducted only regarding one study topic, so for broader generalization, wider samples and other studies would be needed. Nevertheless, as indicated above, already this study indicates how generative AI can be easily and very effectively used to generate learning material for pupils with different knowledge bases on the topics of the lesson. \n\nThe analysis indicates that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, as one example of generative AI, to personalize and customize learning material so that it would match the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. Differences were observed among pupils regarding their reading time of the learning material as well as regarding their answering time to open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The time varied between genders and among pupils from the 4th to 6th grade; however, a more detailed analysis requires larger data. Overall, two out of three pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI modified material with the laptop, and only one out of ten liked it only a little or not at all.",

                "text": "Existing resources for K-12 AI education are generally short, informal learning opportunities that focus on a particular concept or big idea in AI. However, as De la Higuera (2019) argues, schools should make time to teach AI in their classrooms given the relevance of AI in children's lives. This paper details our steps toward making curricula that are practical for classroom by centering student and teacher needs in our design. There are few published pieces on preparing in-service teachers to bring AI education to their classrooms. In one of the most notable examples, Vazhayil et al. (2019) trained 24 secondary school teachers (for students ages 14 to 18) to teach a project-based AI curriculum based on ML4Kids (Vazhayil et al., 2019). The research uncovered potential barriers for broader adoption of such a curriculum, including making tools that are suitable for classrooms with different technological needs, considering the pedagogical strategies used to deliver content, and ensuring that teachers had the knowledge and resources they needed to support their students as they learned. We designed our curricula to address these issues.\n\nThe ubiquity of machine learning algorithms makes them a relatable target for students growing up in this AI-infused age, hence most educational resources teach the basics of supervised machine learning (Marques et al., 2020). More recently, K-12 curricula developed by academic researchers are moving beyond machine learning and teaching more cutting-edge AI topics to students. For instance, generative ML, or AI that can generate new media, is a recent innovation in the field of AI. One of the most common algorithms used for generative ML is called generative adversarial networks, or GANs (Goodfellow, et al., 2014). While GANs can serve as a tool for enhancing creativity in children (Ali et al., 2020), they can also be used to generate fake media that is meant to deceive others (Nguyen et al., 2019). Generative AI tools have been used to create deepfake photos and videos that circulate on popular social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Students begin to be exposed to AI generated media in middle school, as they make their first social media accounts. Unfortunately, to our knowledge",

This article, therefore, responds to the widely recognized need, expressed by scholars and education managers, to study how generative AI and ChatGPT function in school education practices, e.g., [7][8][9]16,[32][33][34]. \n\nThe study involved a total of 110 pupils, aged 8-14 years old, who utilized laptop computers to access the learning material. The research was conducted in Uruguay, specifically within the context of the Social Sciences (History) curriculum and a lesson for the 4th-, 5thand 6th-grade pupils. The application used belongs the Digileac platform, which provides a digitally assisted learning environment supported by the use of generative AI [18]. \n\nThis article provides a detailed explanation of the process involved in creating the lesson, learning material and the assessment methods employed. This information is crucial for understanding the procedures involved in designing future tests effectively. The overall number of analyzed pupils was rather limited and analysis was conducted only regarding one study topic, so for broader generalization, wider samples and other studies would be needed. Nevertheless, as indicated above, already this study indicates how generative AI can be easily and very effectively used to generate learning material for pupils with different knowledge bases on the topics of the lesson. \n\nThe analysis indicates that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, as one example of generative AI, to personalize and customize learning material so that it would match the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. Differences were observed among pupils regarding their reading time of the learning material as well as regarding their answering time to open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The time varied between genders and among pupils from the 4th to 6th grade; however, a more detailed analysis requires larger data. Overall, two out of three pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI modified material with the laptop, and only one out of ten liked it only a little or not at all.",

By systematically categorizing these interactions across both content and task dimensions, our findings provide educators with a nuanced understanding of student interests, learning needs, and emerging use cases for GenAI. This two dimensional framework not only informs pedagogi-cal practice but also lays the groundwork for future research and innovation in the responsible integration of GenAI into K-12 education. For example, future research might further partition K-12 into different age groups. \n\nOur content categorization reveals a broad spectrum of student interests, ranging from traditional educational subjects such as language learning and natural sciences to more personal and exploratory domains like relationships, health, and career aspirations. This diversity underscores the potential of generative AI to support not only academic learning but also personal development and social-emotional growth. \n\nFrom a task perspective, our analysis highlights the multifaceted role generative AI can play in educational settings-from offering creative and motivational support to facilitating reflective writing and structured feedback. Particularly noteworthy is the potential of generative AI to enhance creativity, reflective thinking, and emotional well-being, areas that are often insufficiently addressed by conventional educational tools. \n\nHowever, these opportunities are accompanied by important challenges and open questions. The increasing reliance on generative AI demands increased attention to AI literacy and critical thinking skills among students, particularly in light of potential inaccuracies, biases, and ethical risks. Thus, future research must address these issues, including the long-term educational implications, development of ethical guidelines, and the assurance of equitable access to generative AI tools in schools. \n\nOverall, our study contributes to an evidence-based framework for integrating generative AI responsibly and effectively into educational practice, benefiting students, teachers, curriculum designers, and policymakers alike.",

This paper details our steps toward making curricula that are practical for classroom by centering student and teacher needs in our design. There are few published pieces on preparing in-service teachers to bring AI education to their classrooms. In one of the most notable examples, Vazhayil et al. (2019) trained 24 secondary school teachers (for students ages 14 to 18) to teach a project-based AI curriculum based on ML4Kids (Vazhayil et al., 2019). The research uncovered potential barriers for broader adoption of such a curriculum, including making tools that are suitable for classrooms with different technological needs, considering the pedagogical strategies used to deliver content, and ensuring that teachers had the knowledge and resources they needed to support their students as they learned. We designed our curricula to address these issues.\n\nThe ubiquity of machine learning algorithms makes them a relatable target for students growing up in this AI-infused age, hence most educational resources teach the basics of supervised machine learning (Marques et al., 2020). More recently, K-12 curricula developed by academic researchers are moving beyond machine learning and teaching more cutting-edge AI topics to students. For instance, generative ML, or AI that can generate new media, is a recent innovation in the field of AI. One of the most common algorithms used for generative ML is called generative adversarial networks, or GANs (Goodfellow, et al., 2014). While GANs can serve as a tool for enhancing creativity in children (Ali et al., 2020), they can also be used to generate fake media that is meant to deceive others (Nguyen et al., 2019). Generative AI tools have been used to create deepfake photos and videos that circulate on popular social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Students begin to be exposed to AI generated media in middle school, as they make their first social media accounts. Unfortunately, to our knowledge",
