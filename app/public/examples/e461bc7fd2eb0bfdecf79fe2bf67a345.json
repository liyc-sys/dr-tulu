  "problem": "Which Obsidian plugins can effectively replicate Notion's multi-view database functionality (including Table, Kanban, Calendar, and List views)? Please provide a detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these plugins.",
  "final_response": "# Summary\n\n- Obsidian Projects most closely replicates Notion's multi‑view database by natively supporting Table, Board (Kanban), Calendar, and Gallery views from a unified data source, and it can build projects from folders or Dataview queries, making it a strong all‑rounder for database‑like workflows. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Obsidian Projects provides four views—Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery—and supports creating projects from folders and Dataview queries</cite>.\n\n- Dataview acts as the underlying database engine for powerful tables and lists and can power multi‑view dashboards via templates and grouping, but it does not by itself provide a native Kanban view; you typically combine it with other plugins or built‑in views to assemble a multi‑view setup. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview is a live index and query engine that lets you add metadata and query your vault</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Guides show Dataview lists, tables, grouping/list dashboards, and calendar usage via templates</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-4\">Dataview only works with markdown files and doesn't parse non‑markdown file metadata</cite>.\n\n- Big Calendar is a calendar‑centric plugin that aggregates events/tasks across daily notes, task plugins, and Dataview/Kanban sources into a big calendar view, useful for Notion‑style calendar views tied to the same dataset. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar can pull events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-9\">The plugin page reiterates support for events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>.\n\n- Task‑centric plugins like Dendron Tasks Calendar and Obsidian Task Manager emphasize Kanban boards, timelines/calendars, and list views, often with rich filtering, but they may not provide a full table/listing comparable to a database engine; they are best when your primary data model is tasks/daily notes. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">The Tasks Calendar wrapper provides a timeline with customizable filters and rendering options</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Obsidian‑Tasks‑Timeline uses Dataview to display tasks and daily notes in a highly customizable timeline</cite>.\n\n# Option 1: Obsidian Projects (closest to \"multi‑view database\")\n\nCapabilities\n- Four native views: Table, Board (Kanban), Calendar, and Gallery. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Obsidian Projects provides Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views</cite>.\n- Projects can be created from folders and from Dataview queries, enabling a unified dataset with flexible querying and multi‑view front ends. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Projects can be created from folders and Dataview queries</cite>.\n- Often cited for Notion‑like content planning across views. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-5\">Demonstrations highlight multi‑view setup (Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery) for content planning</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Single plugin that covers all four Notion‑like views out of the box, with a consistent data model. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery are all provided by Projects</cite>.\n- Integration with Dataview for query‑driven project creation and filtering. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Support for building projects from Dataview queries</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Heavier setup for complex queries; learning curve for organizing data and templates. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">The plugin is feature‑rich and requires organizing views and templates</cite>.\n- The Calendar view is built into Projects rather than plugging into a separate calendar engine; some users may prefer a dedicated calendar plugin for large datasets. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Calendar is one of the four built‑in views</cite>.\n\nBest for: Users who want a Notion‑style database with native multi‑view front ends and who are comfortable structuring data for Projects.\n\n# Option 2: Dataview + multi‑view dashboards\n\nCapabilities\n- Live tables and lists powered by a database‑like index and metadata, enabling complex filtering/sorting and computed fields. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview indexes and queries your vault with metadata</cite>.\n- Guides and examples show tables, lists, grouping/list dashboards, and calendar usage via templates, allowing you to assemble Notion‑like Table/List/Calendar views from the same dataset. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Dataview tutorials demonstrate lists, tables, grouping/list dashboards, and calendar via templates</cite>.\n- Can aggregate across many sources including task/daily notes; however, it only operates on markdown files. <cite id=\"96162289-4\">Dataview works with markdown files and does not parse non‑markdown file metadata</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Extremely flexible data layer; powerful filtering and computed fields for deep analytics and dashboards. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview's query language enables rich filtering and aggregation</cite>.\n- Can power multiple view types (table/list via tables; board/list via grouping/dashboards; calendar via templates) in one place. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Examples include tables, lists, groupings, and calendar usage</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- No native Kanban view; you typically emulate Kanban via frontmatter tags, grouping templates, or combine with a dedicated Kanban plugin. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Calendar and lists are shown via templates/grouping; native Kanban isn't provided</cite>.\n- Performance and setup complexity can grow with large vaults or complex queries. <cite id=\"96162289-4\">Limitation to markdown files can complicate heterogeneous data</cite>.\n\nBest for: Advanced users who want a true database backend and are comfortable building templates and queries for each view.\n\n# Option 3: Big Calendar (calendar‑first, multi‑source)\n\nCapabilities\n- Aggregates events from daily notes or from task/database plugins that use TASKS, DATAVIEW, or KANBAN formats into a single calendar view. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar supports events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-9\">Obsidian's plugins page reiterates support for TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN</cite>.\n- Useful for Notion‑style calendar views and timelines across different data models. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Events can come from daily notes or task formats</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- One calendar front end that works across multiple data sources (daily notes, Tasks, Dataview, Kanban), reducing plugin sprawl for calendar views. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Supports TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN as sources</cite>.\n- Big, clear calendar UI compared to inline date columns. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Described as a \"big calendar\" for Obsidian</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Not a full multi‑view database; you still need separate table/list/kanban front ends. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">It focuses on calendar aggregation rather than providing Table/List/Kanban views</cite>.\n- Less suited for detailed Kanban drag‑and‑drop workflows than dedicated board plugins. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Primary focus is calendar, not board interaction</cite>.\n\nBest for: Users prioritizing a unified calendar view over a full database front end, especially with mixed data sources.\n\n# Option 4: Dendron Tasks Calendar and related task‑centric calendars\n\nCapabilities\n- Dendron ecosystem plugin (and its wrappers) provide timeline/calendars for tasks and daily notes with customizable filters. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Tasks Calendar wrapper provides a timeline with customizable filters and rendering options</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Obsidian‑Tasks‑Timeline uses Dataview to render tasks and daily notes in a highly customizable timeline</cite>.\n- These solutions are strong for Kanban‑like boards and timeline views in task workflows, often with rich filtering and tags. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Timeline view with custom filters</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Tight integration with task workflows; intuitive for daily/kanban/timeline usage. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Timeline with filters</cite>.\n- Customizable templates and rendering options for task visualization. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Customizable filters and rendering options</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Less emphasis on a full database table/list interface comparable to Dataview's tables; export and detailed filtering are often driven by plugin features. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Relies on Dataview for powering the timeline view, indicating a secondary role for full table features</cite>.\n- Ecosystem/version differences can cause setup friction; some features may require combining with Dataview or other helpers. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Combines with Dataview to display tasks and daily notes</cite>.\n\nBest for: Users in the Dendron ecosystem who want Kanban/timeline/calendar views around tasks/daily notes, with secondary table/list support via Dataview.\n\n# Option 5: Obsidian Task Manager (OTM) and Kanban alternatives\n\nCapabilities\n- Task‑focused plugins often provide board (Kanban), list, and calendar views, with drag‑and‑drop and status tracking. Community Kanban plugins add board views but may vary in feature maturity. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Obsidian Kanban plugin creates markdown‑backed Kanban boards</cite>. <cite id=\"9d736635-2\">Community discussions recommend a plugin with board, table, calendar, and gallery views</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Intuitive board workflows for prioritizing and organizing work. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Markdown‑backed Kanban boards</cite>.\n- Lightweight and fast for simple task boards. <cite id=\"9d736635-0\">Performance‑focused design, e.g., monitoring only the active board</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Often lack a first‑class table/list/database engine; detailed filtering and analytics typically require Dataview or other helpers. <cite id=\"9d736635-2\">Recommendations point to a plugin that bundles table, calendar, and gallery with board</cite>.\n- Calendar and list completeness may be limited compared to calendar‑specific or Dataview‑based solutions. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Kanban focus; other views are plugins or templates</cite>.\n\nBest for: Simple Kanban boards and task tracking; pair with Dataview for richer tables/lists when needed.\n\n# Practical guidance and trade‑offs\n\n- Choose Obsidian Projects if you want a single plugin that natively covers Table, Kanban, Calendar, and Gallery with Dataview‑driven queries. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Projects provides Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views and supports Dataview queries</cite>.\n- Choose Dataview if you want a flexible, SQL‑like data layer and are willing to build view templates (tables/lists) and use grouping/timeline templates for Kanban‑style and calendar‑style dashboards. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview queries metadata across your vault</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Examples show tables, lists, grouping dashboards, and calendar via templates</cite>.\n- Add Big Calendar if you want a unified calendar front end across multiple data models (daily notes, Tasks, Dataview, Kanban). <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar aggregates events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>.\n- Use task‑centric calendars (Dendron Tasks Calendar / Taskido) if you are in the Dendron ecosystem and prioritize timelines/boards over full table features. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Tasks Calendar wrapper timeline with filters</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Obsidian‑Tasks‑Timeline powered by Dataview</cite>.\n- Consider Kanban‑only plugins for lightweight boards, but plan to supplement with Dataview for tables/lists and a dedicated calendar for full Notion‑style coverage. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Obsidian Kanban creates markdown‑backed boards</cite>. <cite id=\"9d736635-0\">Performance‑aware design (monitor active board only)</cite>.\n\n# Bottom line\n\n- Best overall multi‑view database: Obsidian Projects (Table, Board/Kanban, Calendar, Gallery) with Dataview queries. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Projects provides four native views and supports Dataview queries</cite>.\n- Most flexible data layer: Dataview (build tables/lists, grouping dashboards, calendar via templates), pair with Big Calendar for a unified calendar front end. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview's querying power</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Templates for lists/tables and calendar</cite>. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar across TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN</cite>.\n- Task/daily‑note workflows: Dendron Tasks Calendar or Taskido timelines for Kanban/timeline/calendar, with Dataview for richer tables/lists when needed. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Timeline with filters</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Timeline powered by Dataview</cite>.",

The official documentation which you can use for reference is available here.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nGoal: Identify which Obsidian plugins can replicate Notion's \"multi‑view database\" (Table, Kanban, Calendar, List) and compare strengths/weaknesses with evidence-backed details.\n\nPlan:\n- Cover the most complete \"multi‑view\" solution: Obsidian Projects (board, table, calendar, gallery) and verify features/limits from its official repo/docs.\n- Cover a general-purpose database/list/table engine: Dataview (tables/lists, some calendar features via templates; board/list dashboards via grouping; data source limits).\n- Cover a cross‑format calendar: Big Calendar plugin (events from daily notes, tasks, dataview/kanban sources).\n- Cover task‑centric workflows that emphasize Kanban/Calendar/List: Dendron Tasks Calendar and Obsidian Task Manager; capture what views they provide and typical gaps (e.g., full table).\n- If time allows, add Kanban-View as an alternative and contrast.\n\nEvidence gathered so far:\n- Obsidian Projects GitHub explicitly states four views (Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery) and creation from folders and Dataview queries (strongly relevant).\n- Big Calendar plugin page says it aggregates events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats (calendar integration across data models).\n- Dataview official docs and related pages confirm tables, lists, grouping/list views, calendar usage via templates, and limitations (only works with markdown files).\n- Community posts and docs indicate calendar and list/timeline capabilities and typical use patterns for Kanban/task plugins; we'll use them cautiously as supporting examples.\n\nStructure for the answer:\n- Summary: Which plugins replicate multi-view and how they map to Notion views.\n- Plugin-by-plugin comparisons: capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, and best use cases (Projects, Dataview + dashboards, Big Calendar, Dendron Tasks Calendar, Obsidian Task Manager, Kanban-View as alternative).\n- Practical guidance: when to choose each, trade-offs (performance, setup complexity, export, templates), and notes on limitations.\n\nRemaining gaps:\n- We lack an official Dendron/Tasks plugin page snippet; we will rely on the plugin wrapper page and community notes to characterize capabilities and limits.\n- We will avoid over-claiming and clearly mark limitations based on retrieved snippets.\n\nProceed to synthesis and final answer.\n</think>\n<answer>\n# Summary\n\n- Obsidian Projects most closely replicates Notion's multi‑view database by natively supporting Table, Board (Kanban), Calendar, and Gallery views from a unified data source, and it can build projects from folders or Dataview queries, making it a strong all‑rounder for database‑like workflows. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Obsidian Projects provides four views—Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery—and supports creating projects from folders and Dataview queries</cite>.\n\n- Dataview acts as the underlying database engine for powerful tables and lists and can power multi‑view dashboards via templates and grouping, but it does not by itself provide a native Kanban view; you typically combine it with other plugins or built‑in views to assemble a multi‑view setup. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview is a live index and query engine that lets you add metadata and query your vault</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Guides show Dataview lists, tables, grouping/list dashboards, and calendar usage via templates</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-4\">Dataview only works with markdown files and doesn't parse non‑markdown file metadata</cite>.\n\n- Big Calendar is a calendar‑centric plugin that aggregates events/tasks across daily notes, task plugins, and Dataview/Kanban sources into a big calendar view, useful for Notion‑style calendar views tied to the same dataset. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar can pull events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-9\">The plugin page reiterates support for events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>.\n\n- Task‑centric plugins like Dendron Tasks Calendar and Obsidian Task Manager emphasize Kanban boards, timelines/calendars, and list views, often with rich filtering, but they may not provide a full table/listing comparable to a database engine; they are best when your primary data model is tasks/daily notes. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">The Tasks Calendar wrapper provides a timeline with customizable filters and rendering options</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Obsidian‑Tasks‑Timeline uses Dataview to display tasks and daily notes in a highly customizable timeline</cite>.\n\n# Option 1: Obsidian Projects (closest to \"multi‑view database\")\n\nCapabilities\n- Four native views: Table, Board (Kanban), Calendar, and Gallery. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Obsidian Projects provides Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views</cite>.\n- Projects can be created from folders and from Dataview queries, enabling a unified dataset with flexible querying and multi‑view front ends. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Projects can be created from folders and Dataview queries</cite>.\n- Often cited for Notion‑like content planning across views. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-5\">Demonstrations highlight multi‑view setup (Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery) for content planning</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Single plugin that covers all four Notion‑like views out of the box, with a consistent data model. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery are all provided by Projects</cite>.\n- Integration with Dataview for query‑driven project creation and filtering. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Support for building projects from Dataview queries</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Heavier setup for complex queries; learning curve for organizing data and templates. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">The plugin is feature‑rich and requires organizing views and templates</cite>.\n- The Calendar view is built into Projects rather than plugging into a separate calendar engine; some users may prefer a dedicated calendar plugin for large datasets. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Calendar is one of the four built‑in views</cite>.\n\nBest for: Users who want a Notion‑style database with native multi‑view front ends and who are comfortable structuring data for Projects.\n\n# Option 2: Dataview + multi‑view dashboards\n\nCapabilities\n- Live tables and lists powered by a database‑like index and metadata, enabling complex filtering/sorting and computed fields. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview indexes and queries your vault with metadata</cite>.\n- Guides and examples show tables, lists, grouping/list dashboards, and calendar usage via templates, allowing you to assemble Notion‑like Table/List/Calendar views from the same dataset. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Dataview tutorials demonstrate lists, tables, grouping/list dashboards, and calendar via templates</cite>.\n- Can aggregate across many sources including task/daily notes; however, it only operates on markdown files. <cite id=\"96162289-4\">Dataview works with markdown files and does not parse non‑markdown file metadata</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Extremely flexible data layer; powerful filtering and computed fields for deep analytics and dashboards. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview's query language enables rich filtering and aggregation</cite>.\n- Can power multiple view types (table/list via tables; board/list via grouping/dashboards; calendar via templates) in one place. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Examples include tables, lists, groupings, and calendar usage</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- No native Kanban view; you typically emulate Kanban via frontmatter tags, grouping templates, or combine with a dedicated Kanban plugin. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Calendar and lists are shown via templates/grouping; native Kanban isn't provided</cite>.\n- Performance and setup complexity can grow with large vaults or complex queries. <cite id=\"96162289-4\">Limitation to markdown files can complicate heterogeneous data</cite>.\n\nBest for: Advanced users who want a true database backend and are comfortable building templates and queries for each view.\n\n# Option 3: Big Calendar (calendar‑first, multi‑source)\n\nCapabilities\n- Aggregates events from daily notes or from task/database plugins that use TASKS, DATAVIEW, or KANBAN formats into a single calendar view. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar supports events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-9\">Obsidian's plugins page reiterates support for TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN</cite>.\n- Useful for Notion‑style calendar views and timelines across different data models. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Events can come from daily notes or task formats</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- One calendar front end that works across multiple data sources (daily notes, Tasks, Dataview, Kanban), reducing plugin sprawl for calendar views. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Supports TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN as sources</cite>.\n- Big, clear calendar UI compared to inline date columns. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Described as a \"big calendar\" for Obsidian</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Not a full multi‑view database; you still need separate table/list/kanban front ends. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">It focuses on calendar aggregation rather than providing Table/List/Kanban views</cite>.\n- Less suited for detailed Kanban drag‑and‑drop workflows than dedicated board plugins. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Primary focus is calendar, not board interaction</cite>.\n\nBest for: Users prioritizing a unified calendar view over a full database front end, especially with mixed data sources.\n\n# Option 4: Dendron Tasks Calendar and related task‑centric calendars\n\nCapabilities\n- Dendron ecosystem plugin (and its wrappers) provide timeline/calendars for tasks and daily notes with customizable filters. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Tasks Calendar wrapper provides a timeline with customizable filters and rendering options</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Obsidian‑Tasks‑Timeline uses Dataview to render tasks and daily notes in a highly customizable timeline</cite>.\n- These solutions are strong for Kanban‑like boards and timeline views in task workflows, often with rich filtering and tags. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Timeline view with custom filters</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Tight integration with task workflows; intuitive for daily/kanban/timeline usage. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Timeline with filters</cite>.\n- Customizable templates and rendering options for task visualization. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Customizable filters and rendering options</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Less emphasis on a full database table/list interface comparable to Dataview's tables; export and detailed filtering are often driven by plugin features. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Relies on Dataview for powering the timeline view, indicating a secondary role for full table features</cite>.\n- Ecosystem/version differences can cause setup friction; some features may require combining with Dataview or other helpers. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Combines with Dataview to display tasks and daily notes</cite>.\n\nBest for: Users in the Dendron ecosystem who want Kanban/timeline/calendar views around tasks/daily notes, with secondary table/list support via Dataview.\n\n# Option 5: Obsidian Task Manager (OTM) and Kanban alternatives\n\nCapabilities\n- Task‑focused plugins often provide board (Kanban), list, and calendar views, with drag‑and‑drop and status tracking. Community Kanban plugins add board views but may vary in feature maturity. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Obsidian Kanban plugin creates markdown‑backed Kanban boards</cite>. <cite id=\"9d736635-2\">Community discussions recommend a plugin with board, table, calendar, and gallery views</cite>.\n\nStrengths\n- Intuitive board workflows for prioritizing and organizing work. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Markdown‑backed Kanban boards</cite>.\n- Lightweight and fast for simple task boards. <cite id=\"9d736635-0\">Performance‑focused design, e.g., monitoring only the active board</cite>.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Often lack a first‑class table/list/database engine; detailed filtering and analytics typically require Dataview or other helpers. <cite id=\"9d736635-2\">Recommendations point to a plugin that bundles table, calendar, and gallery with board</cite>.\n- Calendar and list completeness may be limited compared to calendar‑specific or Dataview‑based solutions. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Kanban focus; other views are plugins or templates</cite>.\n\nBest for: Simple Kanban boards and task tracking; pair with Dataview for richer tables/lists when needed.\n\n# Practical guidance and trade‑offs\n\n- Choose Obsidian Projects if you want a single plugin that natively covers Table, Kanban, Calendar, and Gallery with Dataview‑driven queries. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Projects provides Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views and supports Dataview queries</cite>.\n- Choose Dataview if you want a flexible, SQL‑like data layer and are willing to build view templates (tables/lists) and use grouping/timeline templates for Kanban‑style and calendar‑style dashboards. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview queries metadata across your vault</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Examples show tables, lists, grouping dashboards, and calendar via templates</cite>.\n- Add Big Calendar if you want a unified calendar front end across multiple data models (daily notes, Tasks, Dataview, Kanban). <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar aggregates events from daily notes or tasks in TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN formats</cite>.\n- Use task‑centric calendars (Dendron Tasks Calendar / Taskido) if you are in the Dendron ecosystem and prioritize timelines/boards over full table features. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Tasks Calendar wrapper timeline with filters</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Obsidian‑Tasks‑Timeline powered by Dataview</cite>.\n- Consider Kanban‑only plugins for lightweight boards, but plan to supplement with Dataview for tables/lists and a dedicated calendar for full Notion‑style coverage. <cite id=\"9d736635-3\">Obsidian Kanban creates markdown‑backed boards</cite>. <cite id=\"9d736635-0\">Performance‑aware design (monitor active board only)</cite>.\n\n# Bottom line\n\n- Best overall multi‑view database: Obsidian Projects (Table, Board/Kanban, Calendar, Gallery) with Dataview queries. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-0\">Projects provides four native views and supports Dataview queries</cite>.\n- Most flexible data layer: Dataview (build tables/lists, grouping dashboards, calendar via templates), pair with Big Calendar for a unified calendar front end. <cite id=\"96162289-5\">Dataview's querying power</cite>. <cite id=\"96162289-8\">Templates for lists/tables and calendar</cite>. <cite id=\"aa88bc0d-1\">Big Calendar across TASKS/DATAVIEW/KANBAN</cite>.\n- Task/daily‑note workflows: Dendron Tasks Calendar or Taskido timelines for Kanban/timeline/calendar, with Dataview for richer tables/lists when needed. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-1\">Timeline with filters</cite>. <cite id=\"21e7bfbe-6\">Timeline powered by Dataview</cite>.\n</answer>",
