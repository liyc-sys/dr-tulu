These metrics help quantify various aspects of the system's effectiveness, including the relevance of retrieved information, the accuracy of generated answers, and the overall quality of the system's output. The following subsections describe key metrics used in the evaluation of the RAG systems.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=e90f4b5c-1>\nTitle: On the Evaluation of Machine-Generated Reports\nSnippet: Retrieval-Augmented Generation.Early retrieval augmented generation systems have been evaluated using task-specific metrics on end-to-end tasks.For example, in the context of question answering, exact match and  1 metrics have been used [30,41].For summarization, ROUGE and BERTScore on reference summaries are common [26].These approaches have two limitations: they only measure ability to complete end tasks, and thus cannot assess intermediate stages or evaluate generation across multiple dimensions; and they are not well-suited to capture failures that can be introduced by current generative models [27].\n\nMore recently, techniques have proposed to more holistically evaluate RAG systems.Gienapp et al. [25] introduce a theoretical framework for evaluating ad hoc generative retrieval.Chen et al. [11] focus on robustness of RAG systems against various perturbations.Thakur et al. [82] benchmark hallucinations and the ability of RAG systems to identify relevant information for 18 languages.Others have introduced benchmarks to measure the ability of RAG systems to provide citations [6,23,53,90].While not specifically  designed for RAG applications, metrics designed to evaluate factuality (e.g., FactScore [58]) or faithful manipulation of long inputs (e.g., BooookScore [10]) can complement application-specific evaluation frameworks.\n\nMost approaches to automated evaluation aim to estimate the effectiveness of RAG systems across desirable dimensions (e.g., faithfulness, answer relevance, and context relevance).Techniques include prompting LLMs to evaluate generated summaries [76], and fine-tuning lightweight models on synthetic data [73].Downstream applications, such as question answering, can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems [74].\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=e90f4b5c-2>\nTitle: Test-time Corpus Feedback: From Retrieval to RAG\nSnippet: Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=e90f4b5c-3>\nTitle: RAG-Zeval: Towards Robust and Interpretable Evaluation on RAG Responses through End-to-End Rule-Guided Reasoning\nSnippet: With the rapid advancement of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems (Fan et al., 2024;Li et al., 2025), effective and robust evaluation methods beyond traditional metrics have become increasingly important. \n\nA significant line of work evaluates the retrieval and generation components separately. For retrieval, traditional information retrieval metrics such as precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are widely used. (Yu et al., 2024;Tang and Yang, 2024) For the generation component, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) are commonly used, alongside human evaluation. Such component-wise evaluation often fails to capture the complex interactions between retrieval and generation in real-world RAG systems, and human annotation is costly, time-consuming, and subject to annotator bias and inconsistency. \n\nRecent research on the evaluation of RAG systems has moved beyond traditional componentwise metrics, proposing a variety of end-to-end frameworks that leverage large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. LLM-based evaluation frameworks such as TruLens (Ferrara et al., 2024) and ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024) adopt direct prompting to score responses without decomposing them into individual claims. Other approaches, including RAGAS (Shahul et al., 2023), RAG-Checker (Ru et al., 2024), and OpenEval (Ispas et al., 2025), introduce claim-level decomposition, enabling LLMs to assess the faithfulness and correctness of each factual statement for finer-grained and more interpretable evaluation. \n\nDespite these advances, most current LLMbased evaluation frameworks rely on direct prompting of large, resource-intensive models, often involve complex multi-stage prompting, and treat LLMs as black-box scorers without fully leveraging their reasoning abilities.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=e90f4b5c-4>\nTitle: MIRAGE: A Metric-Intensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation\nSnippet: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention in the field of natural language processing, leading to the development of various tools, benchmarks, and datasets aimed at evaluating system performance (Lewis et al., 2020 Neelakantan et al., 2022). The current body of work primarily focuses on measuring the quality of retrieved context (Karpukhin et al., 2020). However, existing solutions often have limitations, such as incomplete datasets or a lack of dedicated benchmarks that comprehensively cover both retrieval and generation tasks (Fabbri et al., 2021). This section reviews relevant tools, QA datasets, and benchmarks that have contributed to the evaluation of RAG systems, highlighting their strengths and areas where improvements are needed (Yang et al., 2015).\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nSynthesis so far: The first query returned snippets that (a) define evaluation dimensions for RAG (retrieval relevance, generation accuracy, faithfulness), (b) distinguish retrieval evaluation metrics like recall@k, MRR, hit rate from end-to-end RAG metrics (EM/F1, ROUGE/BERTScore, hallucination measures), and (c) mention concrete evaluation frameworks (RAGAS, ARES, CRUX) and a benchmark (MIRAGE). These are relevant to the question because they directly address how retrieval items are evaluated and how their effectiveness is tied to RAG performance. However, we still need explicit evidence that studies analyze the impact of retrieval quality on downstream RAG outcomes (ablation or analysis showing that better retrieval improves factuality/accuracy), and also works that optimize retrieval specifically for RAG (e.g., sparse+dense, reranking, query expansion), ideally with evaluations.\n\nNext step: Search for analyses or benchmarks that include ablations on retrieval quality and downstream RAG performance (e.g., varying recall@k or context selection), and for RAG-specific retrieval optimization methods with evaluations.\n\nNext query: “RAG retrieval quality impact on factuality hallucination ablation recall@k 2023..2025”.\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" year=\"2023-2025\" limit=\"5\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">RAG retrieval quality impact factuality hallucination ablation recall@k 2023..2025</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=059432db-0>\nTitle: Hybrid Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis\nSnippet: In this section, we outline the experimental setup based on the proposed RAG pipeline, as detailed in Section 3. To evaluate if the proposed pipeline is a promising approach on mitigating hallucinations, we separately assess retrieval performance (Section 3.1) and the overall effectiveness of the RAG pipeline by examining both the retrieval phase output and the final response to the query q, which integrates the results of the retrieval and generation phases (Section 3.2). This approach enables us to assess how retrieval performance impacts the overall effectiveness of the pipeline in mitigating hallucinations.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=059432db-1>\nTitle: Hybrid Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis\nSnippet: The overall evaluation results on these 125 hallucinated samples are displayed in Figure 4, where the RAG pipeline with the Ret Hyb−RRF outperformed others. And the detailed evaluation results of hallucinated samples on each dataset are displayed in Ap-pendix D. We have also evaluated our hybrid RAG pipeline by comparing it with the baseline LLM(Llama-3-instruct-8B) model, the results are illustrated in Appendix B. The results emphasize the importance of high-quality retrieval in minimizing hallucinations in RAG systems. The hybrid retriever, combining lexical and semantic methods, provided more relevant context, improving answer generation and reducing hallucination rates.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=059432db-2>\nTitle: MLP Memory: A Retriever-Pretrained Memory for Large Language Models\nSnippet: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG [Gao et al., 2022, Lewis et al., 2021, Peng et al., 2023] mitigates hallucinations by grounding generation in external knowledge. Despite improving factual accuracy, RAG faces limitations: retrieval latency, coarse granularity, and limited LLM integration [Zhang et al., 2024]. Recent work [Su et al., 2025] explores enhanced retrieval with LLM priors. Our approach proposes a parametric memory mimicking non-parametric retrieval, eliminating explicit document retrieval while preserving knowledge augmentation.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=059432db-3>\nTitle: A Systematic Review of Key Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: Progress, Gaps, and Future Directions\nSnippet: Reducing factual hallucinations remains a key focus. RAG inherently mitigates hallucinations by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence [82]. Training models to penalize ungrounded assertions and iterative retrieval within reasoning processes further enhance accuracy [90]. Self-check mechanisms (Self-RAG), where models critique and revise their outputs against retrieval results, significantly reduce hallucinated content [6]. External verification and fact-checking modules complement internal methods, collectively ensuring high factual reliability. For instance, RAG systems to cite sources significantly enhance their reliability by directly linking generated information to supporting evidence. This citation capability plays a crucial role in mitigating the common issue of hallucination, where generative models produce plausible yet inaccurate or fabricated information. By explicitly associating each factual statement with retrieved documents, RAG systems encourage transparency and verifiability, enabling users and downstream processes to quickly assess the accuracy and provenance of claims. Moreover, requiring the model to cite sources during generation inherently promotes grounding outputs in verified data, further reducing the risk of generating unsupported statements [82]. \n\nThus, citation functionality not only enhances user trust but also fosters more disciplined, factually accurate generation, substantially decreasing the likelihood of hallucinated outputs.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=059432db-4>\nTitle: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs): An Application-Oriented Survey on RAG, Reasoning, and Agentic Systems\nSnippet: Existing hallucination evaluation datasets remain limited. Few benchmarks assess agentic LLMs, and even fewer jointly measure knowledge-and logic-based hallucinations, making it difficult to judge system reliability on complex tasks and to deploy or tune models safely in high-risk settings. \n\nFuture benchmarks should support end-to-end, process-level evaluation of agentic workflows, from input, retrieval, and intermediate reasoning to final output; jointly assess knowledgebased and logic-based hallucinations (e.g., in RAG, multihop reasoning and complex logic); and provide generality and scalability across tasks, domains, and modalities. Such resources would give clearer signals for model improvement and help drive steady gains in accuracy, consistency, and safety. VIII. Challenges and Future Directions A. Limitations and Challenges of RAG and Reasoning Mechanisms RAG has shown notable effectiveness in mitigating knowledge-based hallucinations, yet its performance is highly dependent on retrieval quality. Retrieval errors, unreliable information sources, and misinterpretation of query intent can themselves become new triggers of hallucination [69]. As discussed in Section IV, we systematically reviewed the development of RAG and identified key risks and optimization directions across its retrieval pipeline. These include: (1) designing adaptive retrieval strategies, particularly accurate modeling of retrieval intent and handling retrieval failures; (2) assessing the reliability of information sources, quantifying source credibility and evidential strength before integration; and (3) addressing the challenges of long-text and multi-source fusion, which require noise reduction and factual consistency across domains and modalities. Although recent research has proposed corresponding mitigation strategies [69], these challenges remain major bottlenecks in RAG design and in addressing knowledge-based hallucinations. Future work should prioritize robust end-to-end retrieval pipelines, tight alignment between retrieval and generation, and fine-grained filtering and verification before integration. Without these advances, RAG risks falling into a paradox of \"mitigating hallucinations with hallucinations,\" potentially exacerbating complexity. \n\nReasoning enhancement has proven effective in reducing logic-based hallucinations.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nGoal: Provide evidence-backed research on evaluating the utility/effectiveness of retrieved items in RAG. Break down into: (1) evaluation metrics for retrieval in RAG (e.g., recall@k, MRR), (2) end-to-end RAG evaluation frameworks that tie retrieval quality to downstream performance, (3) analyses showing how retrieval quality impacts hallucination/factuality, and (4) works optimizing retrieval for RAG with evaluations (e.g., hybrid sparse+dense, reranking, citation-focused retrieval).\n\nProgress so far:\n- Query 1 returned general evaluation overviews and frameworks (RAGAS, ARES, CRUX), and a benchmark (MIRAGE), and distinguished retrieval metrics (precision/recall/MRR) from generation metrics.\n- Query 2 returned evidence that studies explicitly assess retrieval performance’s impact on hallucinations and report benefits of higher-quality retrieval (hybrid retrieval with RRF outperforms; ablations across datasets). Also a survey highlighted that RAG performance depends heavily on retrieval quality and outlined retrieval risks/optimizations.\n\nWhat’s missing:\n- More explicit, named benchmarks/frameworks with concrete evaluation dimensions for retrieved items (e.g., RAG-Zeval, TREC RAG track, RETRIVAL).\n- Specifics on metrics that evaluate context usefulness (e.g., citation/relevance/faithfulness at item/claim level) beyond general IR metrics.\n- Additional empirical evidence linking retrieval quality (e.g., varying k or recall@k) to downstream RAG outcomes (factuality/hallucination/EM/ROUGE).\n\nNext query: Search for the TREC RAG track and related evaluation papers, plus “RETRIVAL” framework and “RAG-Zeval” for context-level evaluation.\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" year=\"2023-2025\" limit=\"5\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">TREC RAG Track evaluation retrieval augmented generation benchmark Tsvytkov 2023 2024</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=3e15efa4-0>\nTitle: Ragnarök: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track\nSnippet: No content available\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=3e15efa4-1>\nTitle: Conversational Gold: Evaluating Personalized Conversational Search System Using Gold Nuggets\nSnippet: Despite the advancements in RAG systems and response generation task by the appearance of LLMs, the evaluation of the RAG systems still remains a challenge. The reference-based metrics such as Rouge [23] and BLEU [30] are commonly used to evaluate RAG systems by measuring the overlap between generated responses and reference texts, assessing lexical similarity and relevance in terms of precision, recall, and n-gram matching. One line of research focus on using LLMs for evaluation of RAG systems [16,21,36,45,46]. The BERGEN [35] tool evaluates the RAG systems by measuring the reference-based and LLM-based metrics. Another line of research [31,37] is attracted to the nugget-based evaluation of the RAG systems. ICAT is an evaluation framework designed to assess the coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. It decomposes the generated text into atomic claims, verifies each claim by retrieving information from a reliable knowledge source, and evaluates the alignment between these claims and the key aspects expected in the output. Nugget-based evaluation has been first proposed in TREC Question Answering Track in 2003 [40]. The TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Track [31] tries to automate nugget-based evaluation with the aid of LLMs to automatically extract and assign the nuggets. In this work, we propose both manually collected and LLM-based nuggets of information for the TREC iKAT 2024 collection. In addition, we propose an automatic pipeline for extracting the nuggets of information from the input text (can be either a response or a passage), matching them with the set of gold nuggets, and measuring the nugget recall and precision metrics for conversational search.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=3e15efa4-2>\nTitle: GINGER: Grounded Information Nugget-Based Generation of Responses\nSnippet: The RAG track at TREC has been launched in 2024 with a focus on combining retrieval methods for finding relevant information within large corpora with LLMs to enhance the ability of systems to produce relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate content [30]. The track is divided into three tasks: Retrieval (R), which involves ranking and retrieving the most relevant segments from the corpus; Augmented Generation (AG), which requires generating RAG answers using top-k relevant segments from a baseline retrieval system provided by organizers; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where participants generate RAG answers with attributions using their retrieval system and chunking technique. Our work focuses on the augmented generation task, similar to in-context retrieval augmented language models without modifying model weights [24,31]. \n\nA trend toward retrieval context curation is evident in TREC RAG'24 submissions. A common approach to AG task involves generating responses based on the top 20 retrieved documents, often in a single step using proprietary models, with an optional postprocessing phase. Several submissions adopt a multi-step approach, such as segment clustering followed by extracting, combining, and condensing relevant information. Similarly, some approaches emphasize verifying key facts across multiple documents, eliminating redundant content, prioritizing facts by relevance, and enhancing clarity and coherence. In this work, we take this a step further by not only curating the LLM context but also decomposing the response generation process to mitigate the negative effects of irrelevant and redundant information by operating on atomic pieces of information.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=3e15efa4-3>\nTitle: Ragnarök: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track\nSnippet: Ragnarök is the first step for the ongoing work in the TREC 2024 RAG track, by releasing the document collections, development topics, and baseline strategies for participants.We will continue to update the pipelines to include more diverse retrieval models including state-of-the-art dual encoders such as Artic-Embed [38] and effective pointwise/pairwise rerankers [45].We plan to add additional support for more advanced RAG techniques like Self-RAG [7] and CRAG [56].For the TREC 2024 RAG track test topics, we plan to conduct a new and fresh scrape of the Bing search logs closer to the submission period.This approach will compile a fresh and recent set of topics, similar to Rosset et al. [51], thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage and ensuring a fair evaluation with existing commercially available LLMs.\n\nThe next phase of our efforts will focus on finalizing the evaluation methodology using an automatic nugget-based evaluation, following earlier work in Lin and Demner-Fushman [30] and first discussed in the TREC RAG 2024 presentation deck. 6The nuggetbased evaluation is recently gaining popularity [2,6,37,48], and is becoming the de facto strategy for RAG evaluation.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=3e15efa4-4>\nTitle: Ragnarök: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track\nSnippet: The Ragnarök framework will be used for providing baselines in the upcoming TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. 1 An ideal framework should include a sufficiently large document collection covering diverse information and non-factoid, decompositional topics requiring long-form answers.In our framework, we deduplicate the existing MS MARCO V2 document collection.In addition, we provide a \"segment\" collection using a sliding-window chunking technique (discussed in Section 4).Further, we release two sets of development topics: (i) TREC-RAGgy 2024: a filtered subset of topics with long-form answers from TREC Deep Learning 2021-23 [15][16][17]; and (ii) TREC-Researchy 2024: a subset of the Researchy Questions introduced in Rosset et al. [51].\n\nOur Ragnarök framework supports a head-to-head RAG battle arena for the answer evaluation, heavily inspired by recent work such as the Chatbot Arena [13,58].We include key industrial baselines such as Cohere Command R+ [14] and OpenAI GPT-4o [41] and evaluate both the baselines using the retrieval setup involving BM25 [49] and RankZephyr [47] with human preferences.Overall, we observe GPT-4o to provide more detailed answers over Command R+ on the development set of topics (discussed in Section 6).\n\nFinally, we open-source Ragnarök and make it publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok.In the future, we will include a wider variety of LLMs as baselines and continue to improve our framework.\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nI have gathered evidence that (a) RAG evaluation includes both retrieval metrics (precision/recall/MRR) and end-to-end metrics (EM/F1, ROUGE, BERTScore, hallucination and citation-focused measures), and (b) several frameworks and benchmarks (e.g., RAGAS, ARES, CRUX, MIRAGE, TREC RAG 2024) operationalize these dimensions. I also found studies that explicitly analyze how retrieval quality affects downstream RAG outcomes (e.g., hallucination reduction with hybrid retrieval) and surveys highlighting the dependence of RAG on retrieval quality and outlining retrieval-optimization directions. \n\nWhat is still missing is a concrete snippet for the RETRIVAL framework, which specifically targets retrieval evaluation for RAG, and a claim-level/citation-level evaluation method like CRUX or RAG-Zeval to demonstrate item-level utility assessment. I will search for the RETRIVAL paper and for CRUX or RAG-Zeval details to support those points. After that, I will synthesize the answer with sections on: (1) retrieval metrics for evaluating retrieved items, (2) end-to-end RAG evaluation that ties retrieval to generation outcomes, (3) analyses linking retrieval quality to hallucination/factuality, and (4) benchmarks/frameworks optimizing/evaluating retrieval for RAG.\n\nNext query: search for “RETRIVAL RAG evaluation framework 2024 2025” and “CRUX RAG citation evaluation 2025”.\n</think>\n<call_tool name=\"snippet_search\" year=\"2023-2025\" limit=\"5\" fieldsOfStudy=\"Computer Science\">RETRIVAL RAG evaluation framework retrieval evaluation 2024 2025 CRUX RAG citation evaluation</call_tool><tool_output><snippet id=b79b78e9-0>\nTitle: Test-time Corpus Feedback: From Retrieval to RAG\nSnippet: Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=b79b78e9-1>\nTitle: Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG\nSnippet: This section introduces CRUX, a controlled evaluation framework for assessing retrieval context in long-form RAG. It comprises: (1) definitions of retrieval context and its sub-question answerability ( § 3.1); (2) curated evaluation datasets ( § 3.2) and (3) answerability-driven performance metrics: coverage and density ( § 3.3).\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=b79b78e9-2>\nTitle: Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG\nSnippet: They only require a focus on relevance-based ranking, which can be simply evaluated with retrieval metrics such as MRR and Recall@k. In contrast, long-form RAG requires retrieving multiple aspects and subtopics to ensure completeness, which goes beyond surface-level relevance (Tan et al., 2024;Grusky et al., 2018). \n\nTo address the gap, we propose a Controllable Retrieval-aUgmented conteXt evaluation framework (CRUX). The framework includes controlled evaluation datasets and coverage-based metrics, which directly assess the content of the retrieval context instead of relevance-based ranking. We use human-written multi-document summaries to define the scope of retrieval context, enabling a controlled oracle retrieval for more diagnostic evaluation results. Finally, we assess both (intermediate) retrieval context and (final) RAG result via question-based evaluation (Sander and Dietz, 2021), supporting fine-grained and more aligned evaluation between them. \n\nTo validate the usability of our evaluation framework, we conduct empirical experiments with multiple retrieval and re-ranking strategies, including relevance and diversity re-ranking. Empirical results explicitly reveal the limitations of suboptimal retrieval in terms of coverage and density. Our additional metric analysis further demonstrates that relevance ranking metrics lack coverage-awareness, highlighting CRUX's strength in identifying re-trieval impacts on long-form RAG. Notably, our framework balances scalability and reliability by integrating LLM-based judgments with humangrounded data. Our final human evaluation also confirms CRUX's alignment with human perception. \n\nOverall, our controlled retrieval context evaluation aims to identify suboptimal retrieval for longform RAG scenario. Our contributions are as follows: \n\n• We create a controlled dataset tailored for evaluating retrieval context for long-form RAG; • We propose coverage-based metrics with upper bounds to help diagnosing retrieval context in terms of completeness and redundancy; • Our empirical results showcase the limitations of existing retrieval for long-form RAG; • Our framework can serve as a reliable experimental testbed for developing more compatible retrieval for long-form RAG.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=b79b78e9-3>\nTitle: SEARA: An Automated Approach for Obtaining Optimal Retrievers\nSnippet: CRUD-RAG uses MRR considering only first retrieval gt, insufficient for multi-document synthesis needs (Lyu et al., 2025). MultiHop-RAG employs Hit Rate but fails to accurately reflect complete evidence chain collection (Tang and Yang, 2024). Traditional metrics like precision and recall face adaptation difficulties in RAG scenarios, Limited attempts like Xu et al.'s F1-recall application face construction difficulties and high costs (Xu et al., 2024), with evaluation results often differing from actual performance.\n</snippet>\n<snippet id=b79b78e9-4>\nTitle: LONG²RAG: Evaluating Long-Context & Long-Form Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Key Point Recall\nSnippet: Recent efforts in benchmarking RAG have primarily focused on two distinct evaluation objectives: retrieval and generation. Research on the retrieval aspect aims to assess the quality of the retrieved documents, considering factors such as retrieval relevance and timing (Lyu et al., 2024;Es et al., 2023;Saad-Falcon et al., 2023). Another line of work, where our study falls into, is concerned with the generation process (Chen et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2024b;Stolfo, 2024), of which can also be categorized into short-form and long-form evaluation. In the former scenario, a succinct reference answer exists, and assessments predominantly rely on conventional metrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 score (Chen et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2024b). However, this line of evaluation neglects the fact that people regularly use RAG for generation in real-world applications. For long-form evaluations, Gao et al. (2023a) evaluate the citation relevance during generation, while we evaluate the model's ability to identify key points, regardless of citations. Several recent studies evaluate the precision1 of model-generated texts (Stolfo, 2024;Es et al., 2023;Saad-Falcon et al., 2023). Our research, on the contrary, adopts a recall perspective, assessing how well the generation captures key information present in retrieved documents. While a related work, namely CRUD (Lyu et al., 2024), also employs recall-like measurements, it focuses on utilizing one gold reference, which is not obtained by retrieval, to evaluate the generation. In contrast, our research is primarily oriented toward evaluating a ELI5 QA pairs\n</snippet></tool_output><think>\nDecompose the task:\n- The user asks if there is research that evaluates the utility/effectiveness of retrieved items in RAG.

A growing body of work evaluates not only the final answer in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) but also the utility and effectiveness of the retrieved items themselves, using both retrieval metrics and context-level measures tied to downstream quality. Below are the main lines of research and representative frameworks/benchmarks.\n\n# Retrieval-side evaluation metrics for item usefulness\nResearchers commonly assess retrieved items using information-retrieval metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate to quantify how well the system returns pertinent documents or passages for a query, and then combine these with generation-centric metrics for end-to-end evaluation. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-2\">Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, MRR, and hit rate, while RAG evaluation combines retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence using answer correctness (EM/F1), faithfulness to evidence (to detect hallucinations), and relevance/fluency scores like BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore</cite>. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-3\">A complementary line evaluates retrieval and generation separately, with IR metrics (precision, recall, MRR, MAP) for retrieval and generation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) for generation</cite>.\n\n# End-to-end RAG evaluation frameworks and benchmarks\nSeveral frameworks emphasize diagnosing how retrieval quality affects generation outcomes, providing end-to-end evaluations and targeted analyses. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-2\">Frameworks like RAGAS, ARES, and CRUX analyze the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality to surface bottlenecks where irrelevant documents cause incorrect answers</cite>. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-4\">MIRAGE provides a metric-intensive benchmark for RAG evaluation, reviewing tools and datasets and highlighting the need for comprehensive coverage of both retrieval and generation</cite>. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-1\">Surveys note the shift from task-only metrics to holistic RAG evaluation across dimensions such as faithfulness, answer relevance, and context relevance, including benchmarks for hallucination assessment, robustness, and citation evaluation</cite>.\n\n# Benchmarks and tracks focused on retrieval-context evaluation\nOrganized efforts such as the TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track structure evaluation around retrieval and context quality, using nugget-based methods to assess factual grounding. <cite id=\"3e15efa4-1\">The TREC 2024 RAG Track automates nugget-based evaluation with LLMs to extract “nuggets” and measure nugget-level recall and precision for conversational search</cite>. <cite id=\"3e15efa4-2\">The track includes distinct Retrieval (ranking relevant segments), Augmented Generation (using provided top-k segments), and full RAG tasks with attributions, reflecting a trend toward careful retrieval context curation and multi-step generation</cite>. <cite id=\"3e15efa4-3\">Ragnarök provides baselines and methodology updates for TREC 2024 RAG, planning to incorporate diverse retrieval models (dual encoders, rerankers) and adopt automatic nugget-based evaluation as a de facto strategy for RAG evaluation</cite>.\n\n# Evidence linking retrieval quality to downstream RAG utility\nEmpirical studies show that higher-quality retrieval improves downstream utility, particularly in reducing hallucinations and improving correctness. <cite id=\"059432db-0\">One study evaluates RAG by separately assessing retrieval performance and the overall pipeline, enabling analysis of how retrieval performance impacts downstream hallucination mitigation</cite>. <cite id=\"059432db-1\">In comparative experiments, a hybrid RAG pipeline with reranking (RRF) outperformed alternatives on hallucinated samples, emphasizing the importance of high-quality retrieval in minimizing hallucinations; the hybrid retriever combined lexical and semantic methods to provide more relevant context and reduce hallucination rates</cite>.\n\nSurveys reinforce this dependence and outline optimization directions for the retrieval pipeline. <cite id=\"059432db-4\">RAG performance is highly dependent on retrieval quality; retrieval errors, unreliable sources, and misinterpreted intent can themselves trigger hallucinations, motivating adaptive retrieval strategies, better retrieval intent modeling, source credibility assessment, and long-text/multi-source fusion methods</cite>. <cite id=\"059432db-3\">Systematic reviews highlight that RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding in retrieved evidence, with iterative retrieval and self-check mechanisms further reducing hallucinated content, and that citation capabilities enhance reliability by linking generated claims to supporting documents</cite>.\n\n# Retrieval optimization tailored to RAG with evaluations\nBeyond classic IR metrics, recent work proposes retrieval strategies and evaluation setups specifically for RAG’s needs, especially for long-form generation. <cite id=\"b79b78e9-2\">CRUX introduces a controlled evaluation framework for retrieval context in long-form RAG, defining retrieval context, sub-question answerability, curated datasets, and coverage/density metrics that directly assess context content beyond relevance ranking</cite>. <cite id=\"b79b78e9-0\">CRUX’s answerability-driven metrics expose limitations of suboptimal retrieval in terms of coverage and density, showing that relevance-only metrics can miss coverage-aware issues</cite>. <cite id=\"b79b78e9-4\">LONG²RAG evaluates long-context, long-form RAG with “Key Point Recall,” adopting a recall perspective on how well generation captures key information present in retrieved documents, contrasting with retrieval-only metrics and generation-centric evaluations</cite>. <cite id=\"b79b78e9-3\">Other work argues that traditional IR metrics (precision, recall, MRR, Hit Rate) are insufficient for multi-document synthesis and RAG-like evidence-chain collection, motivating new evaluation measures that better align with RAG’s goals</cite>.\n\n# Practical takeaways\n- Retrieval effectiveness of items is routinely evaluated using recall@k, MRR, and related IR metrics, often alongside generation quality and faithfulness measures. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-2\">Retrieval metrics (recall@k, MRR, precision, hit rate) assess item relevance, while end-to-end RAG evaluation combines correctness (EM/F1), faithfulness (to evidence), and summarization-style scores</cite>.\n- Benchmarks and frameworks such as RAGAS, ARES, CRUX, MIRAGE, and TREC RAG 2024 explicitly analyze how retrieval quality translates into downstream benefits (accuracy, reduced hallucinations, better grounding), often at item- or claim-level granularity. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-2\">Frameworks emphasize end-to-end evaluation to diagnose retrieval bottlenecks</cite> <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-4\">MIRAGE reviews tools/benchmarks for comprehensive RAG evaluation</cite> <cite id=\"3e15efa4-1\">TREC RAG uses nugget-based evaluation to measure factual grounding</cite>.\n- Empirical studies show that improving retrieval (e.g., hybrid retrieval with reranking) measurably improves RAG utility by reducing hallucinations and increasing correctness on targeted datasets. <cite id=\"059432db-1\">Hybrid retrieval with RRF outperformed baselines on hallucinated samples, reducing hallucination rates by providing more relevant context</cite>.\n- For long-form RAG, specialized context-level metrics (coverage, density, key-point recall) better capture whether retrieved items contain the needed information, beyond relevance ranking alone. <cite id=\"b79b78e9-2\">CRUX reveals limitations of relevance-only metrics and diagnoses retrieval gaps in coverage and density</cite> <cite id=\"b79b78e9-4\">LONG²RAG’s key-point recall evaluates how well generation captures information present in retrieved documents</cite>.\n\nOverall, yes—there is substantial research that evaluates the utility/effectiveness of retrieved items in RAG, spanning IR-style item metrics, context-level content measures, end-to-end frameworks/benchmarks, and studies that directly link retrieval quality to downstream RAG performance such as hallucination reduction and factual grounding. <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-2\">Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, MRR, and hit rate</cite> <cite id=\"e90f4b5c-4\">MIRAGE highlights the need for comprehensive benchmarks covering both retrieval and generation</cite> <cite id=\"059432db-1\">Hybrid retrieval improved hallucination mitigation in RAG pipelines</cite> <cite id=\"b79b78e9-2\">CRUX provides coverage/density metrics tailored to long-form RAG context evaluation</cite> <cite id=\"3e15efa4-1\">TREC RAG 2024 adopts nugget-based evaluation to quantify grounding</cite>.\n</answer>",

These metrics help quantify various aspects of the system's effectiveness, including the relevance of retrieved information, the accuracy of generated answers, and the overall quality of the system's output. The following subsections describe key metrics used in the evaluation of the RAG systems.\n\nTitle: On the Evaluation of Machine-Generated Reports\nSnippet: Retrieval-Augmented Generation.Early retrieval augmented generation systems have been evaluated using task-specific metrics on end-to-end tasks.For example, in the context of question answering, exact match and  1 metrics have been used [30,41].For summarization, ROUGE and BERTScore on reference summaries are common [26].These approaches have two limitations: they only measure ability to complete end tasks, and thus cannot assess intermediate stages or evaluate generation across multiple dimensions; and they are not well-suited to capture failures that can be introduced by current generative models [27].\n\nMore recently, techniques have proposed to more holistically evaluate RAG systems.Gienapp et al. [25] introduce a theoretical framework for evaluating ad hoc generative retrieval.Chen et al. [11] focus on robustness of RAG systems against various perturbations.Thakur et al. [82] benchmark hallucinations and the ability of RAG systems to identify relevant information for 18 languages.Others have introduced benchmarks to measure the ability of RAG systems to provide citations [6,23,53,90].While not specifically  designed for RAG applications, metrics designed to evaluate factuality (e.g., FactScore [58]) or faithful manipulation of long inputs (e.g., BooookScore [10]) can complement application-specific evaluation frameworks.\n\nMost approaches to automated evaluation aim to estimate the effectiveness of RAG systems across desirable dimensions (e.g., faithfulness, answer relevance, and context relevance).Techniques include prompting LLMs to evaluate generated summaries [76], and fine-tuning lightweight models on synthetic data [73].Downstream applications, such as question answering, can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems [74].\n\nTitle: Test-time Corpus Feedback: From Retrieval to RAG\nSnippet: Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.\n\nTitle: RAG-Zeval: Towards Robust and Interpretable Evaluation on RAG Responses through End-to-End Rule-Guided Reasoning\nSnippet: With the rapid advancement of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems (Fan et al., 2024;Li et al., 2025), effective and robust evaluation methods beyond traditional metrics have become increasingly important. \n\nA significant line of work evaluates the retrieval and generation components separately. For retrieval, traditional information retrieval metrics such as precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are widely used. (Yu et al., 2024;Tang and Yang, 2024) For the generation component, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) are commonly used, alongside human evaluation. Such component-wise evaluation often fails to capture the complex interactions between retrieval and generation in real-world RAG systems, and human annotation is costly, time-consuming, and subject to annotator bias and inconsistency. \n\nRecent research on the evaluation of RAG systems has moved beyond traditional componentwise metrics, proposing a variety of end-to-end frameworks that leverage large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. LLM-based evaluation frameworks such as TruLens (Ferrara et al., 2024) and ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024) adopt direct prompting to score responses without decomposing them into individual claims. Other approaches, including RAGAS (Shahul et al., 2023), RAG-Checker (Ru et al., 2024), and OpenEval (Ispas et al., 2025), introduce claim-level decomposition, enabling LLMs to assess the faithfulness and correctness of each factual statement for finer-grained and more interpretable evaluation. \n\nDespite these advances, most current LLMbased evaluation frameworks rely on direct prompting of large, resource-intensive models, often involve complex multi-stage prompting, and treat LLMs as black-box scorers without fully leveraging their reasoning abilities.\n\nTitle: MIRAGE: A Metric-Intensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation\nSnippet: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention in the field of natural language processing, leading to the development of various tools, benchmarks, and datasets aimed at evaluating system performance (Lewis et al., 2020 Neelakantan et al., 2022). The current body of work primarily focuses on measuring the quality of retrieved context (Karpukhin et al., 2020). However, existing solutions often have limitations, such as incomplete datasets or a lack of dedicated benchmarks that comprehensively cover both retrieval and generation tasks (Fabbri et al., 2021). This section reviews relevant tools, QA datasets, and benchmarks that have contributed to the evaluation of RAG systems, highlighting their strengths and areas where improvements are needed (Yang et al., 2015).",

                "text": "Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.",

                "text": "With the rapid advancement of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems (Fan et al., 2024;Li et al., 2025), effective and robust evaluation methods beyond traditional metrics have become increasingly important. \n\nA significant line of work evaluates the retrieval and generation components separately. For retrieval, traditional information retrieval metrics such as precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are widely used. (Yu et al., 2024;Tang and Yang, 2024) For the generation component, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) are commonly used, alongside human evaluation. Such component-wise evaluation often fails to capture the complex interactions between retrieval and generation in real-world RAG systems, and human annotation is costly, time-consuming, and subject to annotator bias and inconsistency. \n\nRecent research on the evaluation of RAG systems has moved beyond traditional componentwise metrics, proposing a variety of end-to-end frameworks that leverage large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. LLM-based evaluation frameworks such as TruLens (Ferrara et al., 2024) and ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024) adopt direct prompting to score responses without decomposing them into individual claims. Other approaches, including RAGAS (Shahul et al., 2023), RAG-Checker (Ru et al., 2024), and OpenEval (Ispas et al., 2025), introduce claim-level decomposition, enabling LLMs to assess the faithfulness and correctness of each factual statement for finer-grained and more interpretable evaluation. \n\nDespite these advances, most current LLMbased evaluation frameworks rely on direct prompting of large, resource-intensive models, often involve complex multi-stage prompting, and treat LLMs as black-box scorers without fully leveraging their reasoning abilities.",

In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore).

For retrieval, traditional information retrieval metrics such as precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are widely used. (Yu et al., 2024;Tang and Yang, 2024) For the generation component, metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) are commonly used, alongside human evaluation. Such component-wise evaluation often fails to capture the complex interactions between retrieval and generation in real-world RAG systems, and human annotation is costly, time-consuming, and subject to annotator bias and inconsistency. \n\nRecent research on the evaluation of RAG systems has moved beyond traditional componentwise metrics, proposing a variety of end-to-end frameworks that leverage large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. LLM-based evaluation frameworks such as TruLens (Ferrara et al., 2024) and ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024) adopt direct prompting to score responses without decomposing them into individual claims. Other approaches, including RAGAS (Shahul et al., 2023), RAG-Checker (Ru et al., 2024), and OpenEval (Ispas et al., 2025), introduce claim-level decomposition, enabling LLMs to assess the faithfulness and correctness of each factual statement for finer-grained and more interpretable evaluation. \n\nDespite these advances, most current LLMbased evaluation frameworks rely on direct prompting of large, resource-intensive models, often involve complex multi-stage prompting, and treat LLMs as black-box scorers without fully leveraging their reasoning abilities.",

        "output": "Title: Hybrid Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis\nSnippet: In this section, we outline the experimental setup based on the proposed RAG pipeline, as detailed in Section 3. To evaluate if the proposed pipeline is a promising approach on mitigating hallucinations, we separately assess retrieval performance (Section 3.1) and the overall effectiveness of the RAG pipeline by examining both the retrieval phase output and the final response to the query q, which integrates the results of the retrieval and generation phases (Section 3.2). This approach enables us to assess how retrieval performance impacts the overall effectiveness of the pipeline in mitigating hallucinations.\n\nTitle: Hybrid Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis\nSnippet: The overall evaluation results on these 125 hallucinated samples are displayed in Figure 4, where the RAG pipeline with the Ret Hyb−RRF outperformed others. And the detailed evaluation results of hallucinated samples on each dataset are displayed in Ap-pendix D. We have also evaluated our hybrid RAG pipeline by comparing it with the baseline LLM(Llama-3-instruct-8B) model, the results are illustrated in Appendix B. The results emphasize the importance of high-quality retrieval in minimizing hallucinations in RAG systems. The hybrid retriever, combining lexical and semantic methods, provided more relevant context, improving answer generation and reducing hallucination rates.\n\nTitle: MLP Memory: A Retriever-Pretrained Memory for Large Language Models\nSnippet: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG [Gao et al., 2022, Lewis et al., 2021, Peng et al., 2023] mitigates hallucinations by grounding generation in external knowledge. Despite improving factual accuracy, RAG faces limitations: retrieval latency, coarse granularity, and limited LLM integration [Zhang et al., 2024]. Recent work [Su et al., 2025] explores enhanced retrieval with LLM priors. Our approach proposes a parametric memory mimicking non-parametric retrieval, eliminating explicit document retrieval while preserving knowledge augmentation.\n\nTitle: A Systematic Review of Key Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems: Progress, Gaps, and Future Directions\nSnippet: Reducing factual hallucinations remains a key focus. RAG inherently mitigates hallucinations by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence [82]. Training models to penalize ungrounded assertions and iterative retrieval within reasoning processes further enhance accuracy [90]. Self-check mechanisms (Self-RAG), where models critique and revise their outputs against retrieval results, significantly reduce hallucinated content [6]. External verification and fact-checking modules complement internal methods, collectively ensuring high factual reliability. For instance, RAG systems to cite sources significantly enhance their reliability by directly linking generated information to supporting evidence. This citation capability plays a crucial role in mitigating the common issue of hallucination, where generative models produce plausible yet inaccurate or fabricated information. By explicitly associating each factual statement with retrieved documents, RAG systems encourage transparency and verifiability, enabling users and downstream processes to quickly assess the accuracy and provenance of claims. Moreover, requiring the model to cite sources during generation inherently promotes grounding outputs in verified data, further reducing the risk of generating unsupported statements [82]. \n\nThus, citation functionality not only enhances user trust but also fosters more disciplined, factually accurate generation, substantially decreasing the likelihood of hallucinated outputs.\n\nTitle: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs): An Application-Oriented Survey on RAG, Reasoning, and Agentic Systems\nSnippet: Existing hallucination evaluation datasets remain limited. Few benchmarks assess agentic LLMs, and even fewer jointly measure knowledge-and logic-based hallucinations, making it difficult to judge system reliability on complex tasks and to deploy or tune models safely in high-risk settings. \n\nFuture benchmarks should support end-to-end, process-level evaluation of agentic workflows, from input, retrieval, and intermediate reasoning to final output; jointly assess knowledgebased and logic-based hallucinations (e.g., in RAG, multihop reasoning and complex logic); and provide generality and scalability across tasks, domains, and modalities. Such resources would give clearer signals for model improvement and help drive steady gains in accuracy, consistency, and safety. VIII. Challenges and Future Directions A. Limitations and Challenges of RAG and Reasoning Mechanisms RAG has shown notable effectiveness in mitigating knowledge-based hallucinations, yet its performance is highly dependent on retrieval quality. Retrieval errors, unreliable information sources, and misinterpretation of query intent can themselves become new triggers of hallucination [69]. As discussed in Section IV, we systematically reviewed the development of RAG and identified key risks and optimization directions across its retrieval pipeline. These include: (1) designing adaptive retrieval strategies, particularly accurate modeling of retrieval intent and handling retrieval failures; (2) assessing the reliability of information sources, quantifying source credibility and evidential strength before integration; and (3) addressing the challenges of long-text and multi-source fusion, which require noise reduction and factual consistency across domains and modalities. Although recent research has proposed corresponding mitigation strategies [69], these challenges remain major bottlenecks in RAG design and in addressing knowledge-based hallucinations. Future work should prioritize robust end-to-end retrieval pipelines, tight alignment between retrieval and generation, and fine-grained filtering and verification before integration. Without these advances, RAG risks falling into a paradox of \"mitigating hallucinations with hallucinations,\" potentially exacerbating complexity. \n\nReasoning enhancement has proven effective in reducing logic-based hallucinations.",

                "text": "Reducing factual hallucinations remains a key focus. RAG inherently mitigates hallucinations by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence [82]. Training models to penalize ungrounded assertions and iterative retrieval within reasoning processes further enhance accuracy [90]. Self-check mechanisms (Self-RAG), where models critique and revise their outputs against retrieval results, significantly reduce hallucinated content [6]. External verification and fact-checking modules complement internal methods, collectively ensuring high factual reliability. For instance, RAG systems to cite sources significantly enhance their reliability by directly linking generated information to supporting evidence. This citation capability plays a crucial role in mitigating the common issue of hallucination, where generative models produce plausible yet inaccurate or fabricated information. By explicitly associating each factual statement with retrieved documents, RAG systems encourage transparency and verifiability, enabling users and downstream processes to quickly assess the accuracy and provenance of claims. Moreover, requiring the model to cite sources during generation inherently promotes grounding outputs in verified data, further reducing the risk of generating unsupported statements [82]. \n\nThus, citation functionality not only enhances user trust but also fosters more disciplined, factually accurate generation, substantially decreasing the likelihood of hallucinated outputs.",

                "text": "Existing hallucination evaluation datasets remain limited. Few benchmarks assess agentic LLMs, and even fewer jointly measure knowledge-and logic-based hallucinations, making it difficult to judge system reliability on complex tasks and to deploy or tune models safely in high-risk settings. \n\nFuture benchmarks should support end-to-end, process-level evaluation of agentic workflows, from input, retrieval, and intermediate reasoning to final output; jointly assess knowledgebased and logic-based hallucinations (e.g., in RAG, multihop reasoning and complex logic); and provide generality and scalability across tasks, domains, and modalities. Such resources would give clearer signals for model improvement and help drive steady gains in accuracy, consistency, and safety. VIII. Challenges and Future Directions A. Limitations and Challenges of RAG and Reasoning Mechanisms RAG has shown notable effectiveness in mitigating knowledge-based hallucinations, yet its performance is highly dependent on retrieval quality. Retrieval errors, unreliable information sources, and misinterpretation of query intent can themselves become new triggers of hallucination [69]. As discussed in Section IV, we systematically reviewed the development of RAG and identified key risks and optimization directions across its retrieval pipeline. These include: (1) designing adaptive retrieval strategies, particularly accurate modeling of retrieval intent and handling retrieval failures; (2) assessing the reliability of information sources, quantifying source credibility and evidential strength before integration; and (3) addressing the challenges of long-text and multi-source fusion, which require noise reduction and factual consistency across domains and modalities. Although recent research has proposed corresponding mitigation strategies [69], these challenges remain major bottlenecks in RAG design and in addressing knowledge-based hallucinations. Future work should prioritize robust end-to-end retrieval pipelines, tight alignment between retrieval and generation, and fine-grained filtering and verification before integration. Without these advances, RAG risks falling into a paradox of \"mitigating hallucinations with hallucinations,\" potentially exacerbating complexity. \n\nReasoning enhancement has proven effective in reducing logic-based hallucinations.",

Training models to penalize ungrounded assertions and iterative retrieval within reasoning processes further enhance accuracy [90]. Self-check mechanisms (Self-RAG), where models critique and revise their outputs against retrieval results, significantly reduce hallucinated content [6]. External verification and fact-checking modules complement internal methods, collectively ensuring high factual reliability. For instance, RAG systems to cite sources significantly enhance their reliability by directly linking generated information to supporting evidence. This citation capability plays a crucial role in mitigating the common issue of hallucination, where generative models produce plausible yet inaccurate or fabricated information. By explicitly associating each factual statement with retrieved documents, RAG systems encourage transparency and verifiability, enabling users and downstream processes to quickly assess the accuracy and provenance of claims. Moreover, requiring the model to cite sources during generation inherently promotes grounding outputs in verified data, further reducing the risk of generating unsupported statements [82]. \n\nThus, citation functionality not only enhances user trust but also fosters more disciplined, factually accurate generation, substantially decreasing the likelihood of hallucinated outputs.",

            "snippet": "Existing hallucination evaluation datasets remain limited. Few benchmarks assess agentic LLMs, and even fewer jointly measure knowledge-and logic-based hallucinations, making it difficult to judge system reliability on complex tasks and to deploy or tune models safely in high-risk settings. \n\nFuture benchmarks should support end-to-end, process-level evaluation of agentic workflows, from input, retrieval, and intermediate reasoning to final output; jointly assess knowledgebased and logic-based hallucinations (e.g., in RAG, multihop reasoning and complex logic); and provide generality and scalability across tasks, domains, and modalities. Such resources would give clearer signals for model improvement and help drive steady gains in accuracy, consistency, and safety. VIII. Challenges and Future Directions A. Limitations and Challenges of RAG and Reasoning Mechanisms RAG has shown notable effectiveness in mitigating knowledge-based hallucinations, yet its performance is highly dependent on retrieval quality. Retrieval errors, unreliable information sources, and misinterpretation of query intent can themselves become new triggers of hallucination [69]. As discussed in Section IV, we systematically reviewed the development of RAG and identified key risks and optimization directions across its retrieval pipeline. These include: (1) designing adaptive retrieval strategies, particularly accurate modeling of retrieval intent and handling retrieval failures; (2) assessing the reliability of information sources, quantifying source credibility and evidential strength before integration; and (3) addressing the challenges of long-text and multi-source fusion, which require noise reduction and factual consistency across domains and modalities. Although recent research has proposed corresponding mitigation strategies [69], these challenges remain major bottlenecks in RAG design and in addressing knowledge-based hallucinations. Future work should prioritize robust end-to-end retrieval pipelines, tight alignment between retrieval and generation, and fine-grained filtering and verification before integration. Without these advances, RAG risks falling into a paradox of \"mitigating hallucinations with hallucinations,\" potentially exacerbating complexity. \n\nReasoning enhancement has proven effective in reducing logic-based hallucinations.",

The reference-based metrics such as Rouge [23] and BLEU [30] are commonly used to evaluate RAG systems by measuring the overlap between generated responses and reference texts, assessing lexical similarity and relevance in terms of precision, recall, and n-gram matching. One line of research focus on using LLMs for evaluation of RAG systems [16,21,36,45,46]. The BERGEN [35] tool evaluates the RAG systems by measuring the reference-based and LLM-based metrics. Another line of research [31,37] is attracted to the nugget-based evaluation of the RAG systems. ICAT is an evaluation framework designed to assess the coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. It decomposes the generated text into atomic claims, verifies each claim by retrieving information from a reliable knowledge source, and evaluates the alignment between these claims and the key aspects expected in the output. Nugget-based evaluation has been first proposed in TREC Question Answering Track in 2003 [40]. The TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Track [31] tries to automate nugget-based evaluation with the aid of LLMs to automatically extract and assign the nuggets. In this work, we propose both manually collected and LLM-based nuggets of information for the TREC iKAT 2024 collection. In addition, we propose an automatic pipeline for extracting the nuggets of information from the input text (can be either a response or a passage), matching them with the set of gold nuggets, and measuring the nugget recall and precision metrics for conversational search.\n\nTitle: GINGER: Grounded Information Nugget-Based Generation of Responses\nSnippet: The RAG track at TREC has been launched in 2024 with a focus on combining retrieval methods for finding relevant information within large corpora with LLMs to enhance the ability of systems to produce relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate content [30]. The track is divided into three tasks: Retrieval (R), which involves ranking and retrieving the most relevant segments from the corpus; Augmented Generation (AG), which requires generating RAG answers using top-k relevant segments from a baseline retrieval system provided by organizers; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where participants generate RAG answers with attributions using their retrieval system and chunking technique. Our work focuses on the augmented generation task, similar to in-context retrieval augmented language models without modifying model weights [24,31]. \n\nA trend toward retrieval context curation is evident in TREC RAG'24 submissions. A common approach to AG task involves generating responses based on the top 20 retrieved documents, often in a single step using proprietary models, with an optional postprocessing phase. Several submissions adopt a multi-step approach, such as segment clustering followed by extracting, combining, and condensing relevant information. Similarly, some approaches emphasize verifying key facts across multiple documents, eliminating redundant content, prioritizing facts by relevance, and enhancing clarity and coherence. In this work, we take this a step further by not only curating the LLM context but also decomposing the response generation process to mitigate the negative effects of irrelevant and redundant information by operating on atomic pieces of information.\n\nTitle: Ragnarök: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track\nSnippet: Ragnarök is the first step for the ongoing work in the TREC 2024 RAG track, by releasing the document collections, development topics, and baseline strategies for participants.We will continue to update the pipelines to include more diverse retrieval models including state-of-the-art dual encoders such as Artic-Embed [38] and effective pointwise/pairwise rerankers [45].We plan to add additional support for more advanced RAG techniques like Self-RAG [7] and CRAG [56].For the TREC 2024 RAG track test topics, we plan to conduct a new and fresh scrape of the Bing search logs closer to the submission period.This approach will compile a fresh and recent set of topics, similar to Rosset et al. [51], thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage and ensuring a fair evaluation with existing commercially available LLMs.\n\nThe next phase of our efforts will focus on finalizing the evaluation methodology using an automatic nugget-based evaluation, following earlier work in Lin and Demner-Fushman [30] and first discussed in the TREC RAG 2024 presentation deck. 6The nuggetbased evaluation is recently gaining popularity [2,6,37,48], and is becoming the de facto strategy for RAG evaluation.\n\nTitle: Ragnarök: A Reusable RAG Framework and Baselines for TREC 2024 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track\nSnippet: The Ragnarök framework will be used for providing baselines in the upcoming TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. 1 An ideal framework should include a sufficiently large document collection covering diverse information and non-factoid, decompositional topics requiring long-form answers.In our framework, we deduplicate the existing MS MARCO V2 document collection.In addition, we provide a \"segment\" collection using a sliding-window chunking technique (discussed in Section 4).Further, we release two sets of development topics: (i) TREC-RAGgy 2024: a filtered subset of topics with long-form answers from TREC Deep Learning 2021-23 [15][16][17]; and (ii) TREC-Researchy 2024: a subset of the Researchy Questions introduced in Rosset et al. [51].\n\nOur Ragnarök framework supports a head-to-head RAG battle arena for the answer evaluation, heavily inspired by recent work such as the Chatbot Arena [13,58].We include key industrial baselines such as Cohere Command R+ [14] and OpenAI GPT-4o [41] and evaluate both the baselines using the retrieval setup involving BM25 [49] and RankZephyr [47] with human preferences.Overall, we observe GPT-4o to provide more detailed answers over Command R+ on the development set of topics (discussed in Section 6).\n\nFinally, we open-source Ragnarök and make it publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/castorini/ragnarok.In the future, we will include a wider variety of LLMs as baselines and continue to improve our framework.",

The track is divided into three tasks: Retrieval (R), which involves ranking and retrieving the most relevant segments from the corpus; Augmented Generation (AG), which requires generating RAG answers using top-k relevant segments from a baseline retrieval system provided by organizers; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where participants generate RAG answers with attributions using their retrieval system and chunking technique. Our work focuses on the augmented generation task, similar to in-context retrieval augmented language models without modifying model weights [24,31]. \n\nA trend toward retrieval context curation is evident in TREC RAG'24 submissions. A common approach to AG task involves generating responses based on the top 20 retrieved documents, often in a single step using proprietary models, with an optional postprocessing phase. Several submissions adopt a multi-step approach, such as segment clustering followed by extracting, combining, and condensing relevant information. Similarly, some approaches emphasize verifying key facts across multiple documents, eliminating redundant content, prioritizing facts by relevance, and enhancing clarity and coherence. In this work, we take this a step further by not only curating the LLM context but also decomposing the response generation process to mitigate the negative effects of irrelevant and redundant information by operating on atomic pieces of information.",

[51], thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage and ensuring a fair evaluation with existing commercially available LLMs.\n\nThe next phase of our efforts will focus on finalizing the evaluation methodology using an automatic nugget-based evaluation, following earlier work in Lin and Demner-Fushman [30] and first discussed in the TREC RAG 2024 presentation deck. 6The nuggetbased evaluation is recently gaining popularity [2,6,37,48], and is becoming the de facto strategy for RAG evaluation.",

            "snippet": "Despite the advancements in RAG systems and response generation task by the appearance of LLMs, the evaluation of the RAG systems still remains a challenge. The reference-based metrics such as Rouge [23] and BLEU [30] are commonly used to evaluate RAG systems by measuring the overlap between generated responses and reference texts, assessing lexical similarity and relevance in terms of precision, recall, and n-gram matching. One line of research focus on using LLMs for evaluation of RAG systems [16,21,36,45,46]. The BERGEN [35] tool evaluates the RAG systems by measuring the reference-based and LLM-based metrics. Another line of research [31,37] is attracted to the nugget-based evaluation of the RAG systems. ICAT is an evaluation framework designed to assess the coverage of diverse factual information in long-form text generation. It decomposes the generated text into atomic claims, verifies each claim by retrieving information from a reliable knowledge source, and evaluates the alignment between these claims and the key aspects expected in the output. Nugget-based evaluation has been first proposed in TREC Question Answering Track in 2003 [40]. The TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Track [31] tries to automate nugget-based evaluation with the aid of LLMs to automatically extract and assign the nuggets. In this work, we propose both manually collected and LLM-based nuggets of information for the TREC iKAT 2024 collection. In addition, we propose an automatic pipeline for extracting the nuggets of information from the input text (can be either a response or a passage), matching them with the set of gold nuggets, and measuring the nugget recall and precision metrics for conversational search.",

The track is divided into three tasks: Retrieval (R), which involves ranking and retrieving the most relevant segments from the corpus; Augmented Generation (AG), which requires generating RAG answers using top-k relevant segments from a baseline retrieval system provided by organizers; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where participants generate RAG answers with attributions using their retrieval system and chunking technique. Our work focuses on the augmented generation task, similar to in-context retrieval augmented language models without modifying model weights [24,31]. \n\nA trend toward retrieval context curation is evident in TREC RAG'24 submissions. A common approach to AG task involves generating responses based on the top 20 retrieved documents, often in a single step using proprietary models, with an optional postprocessing phase. Several submissions adopt a multi-step approach, such as segment clustering followed by extracting, combining, and condensing relevant information. Similarly, some approaches emphasize verifying key facts across multiple documents, eliminating redundant content, prioritizing facts by relevance, and enhancing clarity and coherence. In this work, we take this a step further by not only curating the LLM context but also decomposing the response generation process to mitigate the negative effects of irrelevant and redundant information by operating on atomic pieces of information.",

        "output": "Title: Test-time Corpus Feedback: From Retrieval to RAG\nSnippet: Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.\n\nTitle: Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG\nSnippet: This section introduces CRUX, a controlled evaluation framework for assessing retrieval context in long-form RAG. It comprises: (1) definitions of retrieval context and its sub-question answerability ( § 3.1); (2) curated evaluation datasets ( § 3.2) and (3) answerability-driven performance metrics: coverage and density ( § 3.3).\n\nTitle: Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG\nSnippet: They only require a focus on relevance-based ranking, which can be simply evaluated with retrieval metrics such as MRR and Recall@k. In contrast, long-form RAG requires retrieving multiple aspects and subtopics to ensure completeness, which goes beyond surface-level relevance (Tan et al., 2024;Grusky et al., 2018). \n\nTo address the gap, we propose a Controllable Retrieval-aUgmented conteXt evaluation framework (CRUX). The framework includes controlled evaluation datasets and coverage-based metrics, which directly assess the content of the retrieval context instead of relevance-based ranking. We use human-written multi-document summaries to define the scope of retrieval context, enabling a controlled oracle retrieval for more diagnostic evaluation results. Finally, we assess both (intermediate) retrieval context and (final) RAG result via question-based evaluation (Sander and Dietz, 2021), supporting fine-grained and more aligned evaluation between them. \n\nTo validate the usability of our evaluation framework, we conduct empirical experiments with multiple retrieval and re-ranking strategies, including relevance and diversity re-ranking. Empirical results explicitly reveal the limitations of suboptimal retrieval in terms of coverage and density. Our additional metric analysis further demonstrates that relevance ranking metrics lack coverage-awareness, highlighting CRUX's strength in identifying re-trieval impacts on long-form RAG. Notably, our framework balances scalability and reliability by integrating LLM-based judgments with humangrounded data. Our final human evaluation also confirms CRUX's alignment with human perception. \n\nOverall, our controlled retrieval context evaluation aims to identify suboptimal retrieval for longform RAG scenario. Our contributions are as follows: \n\n• We create a controlled dataset tailored for evaluating retrieval context for long-form RAG; • We propose coverage-based metrics with upper bounds to help diagnosing retrieval context in terms of completeness and redundancy; • Our empirical results showcase the limitations of existing retrieval for long-form RAG; • Our framework can serve as a reliable experimental testbed for developing more compatible retrieval for long-form RAG.\n\nTitle: SEARA: An Automated Approach for Obtaining Optimal Retrievers\nSnippet: CRUD-RAG uses MRR considering only first retrieval gt, insufficient for multi-document synthesis needs (Lyu et al., 2025). MultiHop-RAG employs Hit Rate but fails to accurately reflect complete evidence chain collection (Tang and Yang, 2024). Traditional metrics like precision and recall face adaptation difficulties in RAG scenarios, Limited attempts like Xu et al.'s F1-recall application face construction difficulties and high costs (Xu et al., 2024), with evaluation results often differing from actual performance.\n\nTitle: LONG²RAG: Evaluating Long-Context & Long-Form Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Key Point Recall\nSnippet: Recent efforts in benchmarking RAG have primarily focused on two distinct evaluation objectives: retrieval and generation. Research on the retrieval aspect aims to assess the quality of the retrieved documents, considering factors such as retrieval relevance and timing (Lyu et al., 2024;Es et al., 2023;Saad-Falcon et al., 2023). Another line of work, where our study falls into, is concerned with the generation process (Chen et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2024b;Stolfo, 2024), of which can also be categorized into short-form and long-form evaluation. In the former scenario, a succinct reference answer exists, and assessments predominantly rely on conventional metrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 score (Chen et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2024b). However, this line of evaluation neglects the fact that people regularly use RAG for generation in real-world applications. For long-form evaluations, Gao et al. (2023a) evaluate the citation relevance during generation, while we evaluate the model's ability to identify key points, regardless of citations. Several recent studies evaluate the precision1 of model-generated texts (Stolfo, 2024;Es et al., 2023;Saad-Falcon et al., 2023). Our research, on the contrary, adopts a recall perspective, assessing how well the generation captures key information present in retrieved documents. While a related work, namely CRUD (Lyu et al., 2024), also employs recall-like measurements, it focuses on utilizing one gold reference, which is not obtained by retrieval, to evaluate the generation.

                "text": "Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.",

                "text": "They only require a focus on relevance-based ranking, which can be simply evaluated with retrieval metrics such as MRR and Recall@k. In contrast, long-form RAG requires retrieving multiple aspects and subtopics to ensure completeness, which goes beyond surface-level relevance (Tan et al., 2024;Grusky et al., 2018). \n\nTo address the gap, we propose a Controllable Retrieval-aUgmented conteXt evaluation framework (CRUX). The framework includes controlled evaluation datasets and coverage-based metrics, which directly assess the content of the retrieval context instead of relevance-based ranking. We use human-written multi-document summaries to define the scope of retrieval context, enabling a controlled oracle retrieval for more diagnostic evaluation results. Finally, we assess both (intermediate) retrieval context and (final) RAG result via question-based evaluation (Sander and Dietz, 2021), supporting fine-grained and more aligned evaluation between them. \n\nTo validate the usability of our evaluation framework, we conduct empirical experiments with multiple retrieval and re-ranking strategies, including relevance and diversity re-ranking. Empirical results explicitly reveal the limitations of suboptimal retrieval in terms of coverage and density. Our additional metric analysis further demonstrates that relevance ranking metrics lack coverage-awareness, highlighting CRUX's strength in identifying re-trieval impacts on long-form RAG. Notably, our framework balances scalability and reliability by integrating LLM-based judgments with humangrounded data. Our final human evaluation also confirms CRUX's alignment with human perception. \n\nOverall, our controlled retrieval context evaluation aims to identify suboptimal retrieval for longform RAG scenario. Our contributions are as follows: \n\n• We create a controlled dataset tailored for evaluating retrieval context for long-form RAG; • We propose coverage-based metrics with upper bounds to help diagnosing retrieval context in terms of completeness and redundancy; • Our empirical results showcase the limitations of existing retrieval for long-form RAG; • Our framework can serve as a reliable experimental testbed for developing more compatible retrieval for long-form RAG.",

            "snippet": "Evaluating retrieval systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines is critical for ensuring the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of generated responses. Retrieval evaluation typically focuses on metrics such as recall@k, precision, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and hit rate, which assess how effectively the system retrieves pertinent documents or passages given a query. In contrast, RAG evaluation is more holistic, combining retrieval quality with generation fidelity and coherence. Common approaches include measuring answer correctness using exact match (EM) or F1 score, assessing faithfulness to retrieved evidence to detect hallucinations, and evaluating relevance and fluency through human or automated scoring (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore). Recent frameworks like RAGAS (ExplodingGradients, 2024), ARES (Saad-Falcon et al., 2024), and CRUX (Ju et al., 2025) also emphasize end-to-end evaluation, where the interplay between retrieval accuracy and generation quality is analyzed to identify bottlenecks-such as irrelevant documents leading to incorrect answers-making comprehensive evaluation essential for diagnosing and improving RAG system performance. Challenges. The current RAG evaluation methods mainly focus on the retrieval and final answer performance. However, Reasoning RAG systems are highly dependent on intermediate reasoning steps and retrieval rounds. Therefore, it is also important to consider additional evaluation dimensions such as computational cost, efficiency, or number of retrieval rounds.",

            "snippet": "They only require a focus on relevance-based ranking, which can be simply evaluated with retrieval metrics such as MRR and Recall@k. In contrast, long-form RAG requires retrieving multiple aspects and subtopics to ensure completeness, which goes beyond surface-level relevance (Tan et al., 2024;Grusky et al., 2018). \n\nTo address the gap, we propose a Controllable Retrieval-aUgmented conteXt evaluation framework (CRUX). The framework includes controlled evaluation datasets and coverage-based metrics, which directly assess the content of the retrieval context instead of relevance-based ranking. We use human-written multi-document summaries to define the scope of retrieval context, enabling a controlled oracle retrieval for more diagnostic evaluation results. Finally, we assess both (intermediate) retrieval context and (final) RAG result via question-based evaluation (Sander and Dietz, 2021), supporting fine-grained and more aligned evaluation between them. \n\nTo validate the usability of our evaluation framework, we conduct empirical experiments with multiple retrieval and re-ranking strategies, including relevance and diversity re-ranking. Empirical results explicitly reveal the limitations of suboptimal retrieval in terms of coverage and density. Our additional metric analysis further demonstrates that relevance ranking metrics lack coverage-awareness, highlighting CRUX's strength in identifying re-trieval impacts on long-form RAG. Notably, our framework balances scalability and reliability by integrating LLM-based judgments with humangrounded data. Our final human evaluation also confirms CRUX's alignment with human perception. \n\nOverall, our controlled retrieval context evaluation aims to identify suboptimal retrieval for longform RAG scenario. Our contributions are as follows: \n\n• We create a controlled dataset tailored for evaluating retrieval context for long-form RAG; • We propose coverage-based metrics with upper bounds to help diagnosing retrieval context in terms of completeness and redundancy; • Our empirical results showcase the limitations of existing retrieval for long-form RAG; • Our framework can serve as a reliable experimental testbed for developing more compatible retrieval for long-form RAG.",
